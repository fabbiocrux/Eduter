We argue that the many perspectives on sustainable development can be mapped on the continuum between ecological sustainability and quality of life. Likewise, the variety of modes of governance can be captured between hierarchical governance and deliberative governance, depending on the degree of involvement of societal actors. From these two typologies we derive a framework for analysis of governance for sustainable development. We realize that the typology is a significant simplification of the complex debates about sustainable development and governance, but it might help scientists and policy makers to explore relevant dimensions of modes of governance for sustainable development and for setting a framework for empirical analysis. The main conclusion of this paper is that the debate on governance for sustainable development will be clarified if the perspective on sustainable development and the mode of governance for achieving it are made more explicit. Problems that are now exclusively associated with sustainable development might well be problems of governance for sustainable development. Without making explicit what type of governance for sustainable development is pursued, miscommunication between stakeholders and mismatches of the approach with the instruments used could be the result, thus hampering progress in implementing sustainable development.

Stevan			Good Governance as a Tool of Sustainable Development	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						good governance; sustainable development	DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; INTERNATIONAL AID; POVERTY	Growing concern about environmental degradation, disappointment with development efforts to reduce poverty and inequality on a global scale together with economic and socio-political instability has shifted focus from the model of economic growth to the new model of sustainable development. Despite the new orientation of development economics, the question on how to achieve sustainable development goals still remains. In order to avoid failure of the neoliberal agenda, the revised version of Washington Consensus focusing on good governance has taken the leading role in development policy. The aim of this research is to test the links between a fuzzy concept of good governance and very heterogonous dimensions of sustainable development. Our research aims to analyze the effects of good governance on particular indicators of sustainable development, especially of socio-economic development, at the level of different categories of countries. This study reveals that statistical significance, direction and intensity of the effects of good governance dimensions vary in relation to the selected indicator of sustainable development and affiliation to the particular category of countries. These results suggest that there is no "one size fits all" model of good governance promoted as a universal mantra of sustainable development putting into question the principles of post-Washington consensus as the key response to modern developmental challenges.

According to research funded by the European Commission, the policies of international organizations rarely refer to the potential of social innovation, neither generally nor in the context of achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. However, a huge number of initiatives around the global are successfully using social innovation approaches, but most do so without using this term. They thereby do not fully understand the potential and strength that a more systematic deployment of social innovation theories, methods and practices could bring. This paper aims to at least partially redress this balance by reporting on evidence derived from the on-going empirical and theoretical research undertaken by the SI-DRIVE research project in relation to policy reduction and sustainable development, in particular by focusing on the governance and policy implications.

For this purpose, 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 230 global indicators were established with the double function of being a report card and a management tool. In the light of a pilot study about the experiences of local planning officials in the City of Gothenburg, Sweden, in relation to the suggested indicators for SDG 11, 'Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable', and a comparison with findings in four other cities, the paper argues for a need to reprioritize indicator criteria to serve better governance for sustainable development in diverse urban contexts worldwide.

This study investigates the influence of corporate governance on sustainable development in a sample of 185 countries over 2005-2020 using a panel linear regression model. Separate analyses are also conducted on subsamples of high- and low-income countries. Our findings highlight the positive influence of corporate governance, as measured by board efficacy, the strength of audits and reports, and digitalisation, on sustainable development, as measured by the Human Development Index, Human Capital Index, and Environmental Performance Index. Moreover, we find a higher positive and marginal effect of the influence of corporate governance on sustainable development for low-income countries than for high-income countries. The robustness checks performed using variables related to the happiness index, women in top management positions, and technology adoption verify our results. Our findings are important for managers and policymakers to consolidate sustainable development through the incentive brought about by high-quality corporate governance.

Stakeholder democracy after the World Summit on Sustainable Development	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual Meeting of the American-Political-Science-Association	SEP 02-05, 2004	Chicago, IL	Amer Polit Sci Assoc		civil society; global environmental governance; multi-stakeholder participation; sustainable development		One of the most pressing problems confronting political scientists today is whether global governance has democratic legitimacy. Drawing on an analysis of the World Summit for Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg in 2002, this article advances and empirically deploys an ideal-typical model of a new approach to key areas of global governance - 'stakeholder democracy'. This work is located in the context of the changing practices of global governance, in which concerns about legitimacy, accountability, and participation have gained prominence. Sustainability is an arena in which innovative experiments with new hybrid, pluri-lateral forms of governance, such as stakeholder forums and partnership agreements institutionalizing relations between state and non-state actors, are taking place. A central argument is that sustainability governance imperfectly exemplifies new deliberative stakeholder practices with general democratic potential at the global level. In examining these governance arrangements, we draw together the nascent elements of this new 'model', such as its distinctive takes on political representation and accountability.											53	180	183	5	77	SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD	LONDON	1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND	1354-0661	1460-3713		EUR J INT RELAT	Eur.

This study systematically reviews the research contributions on the development of STIs based on four criteria including: i) the relevance of the STIs to the sustainable development goals (SDGs); ii) governance; iii) stakeholders involved; and iv) the distinction between subjective and objective indicators. A search of Scopus indexed journals published up to April 2018, yielded 97 papers for examination. The findings demonstrate the lack of direct attention to the SDGs in those papers published after their launch in 2016. However, the majority of the SDGs and their targets have indirectly been covered in the reviewed papers. The results revealed that, among the sustainability themes of economic growth, social inclusion, environmental protection, and governance, the STIs studies tended to overlook the dimension of governance. The findings showed that residents are the most engaged stakeholder group, and tourists the least engaged as compared with government and businesses. The results also indicated that more attention is afforded to objective compared to subjective indicators. The findings also demonstrated that much of the focus is on European countries rather than the Global South which is the major focus of the SDGs.	[Rasoolimanesh, S.

Today, a particularly relevant outcome is advancing Sustainable Governance (SG), i.e., the capacity to steer and coordinate public action towards sustainable development. This article performs an empirical study of the relationship between DG and SG using data about 41 OECD/EU countries from the United Nations' E-Government Survey and the Bertelsmann's Sustainable Governance Indicators project, covering the period from 2014 to 2020. We examine if DG progress pairs with SG progress, apply a DEA model to find out which countries are efficient in using DG for better SG, and uncover cases of imbalance where high DG pairs with poor SG and vice versa. The results show that the efficiency in using DG for SG strongly varies, and that some DG leaders persistently fail to advance or even regress their SG. These findings refute the claims about the benign role of DG and points at democracy as the "weak link" in the analyzed relation.

Declaration of 2017 as the International Year of Sustainable Tourism and adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have seemingly brought tourism to the forefront of development even where the SDGs have limited tourism focus. This paper examines how tourism governance is poorly applied in Africa. It interrogates the challenges of integrating tourism governance, mining, and conservation within the SDGs framework in Africa. Sustainable tourism governance frameworks have not comprehensively inculcated trust justice, social capital, power, and participation. Using mining and conservation in South Africa and Zimbabwe respectively, it analyses how mining affects sustainability, as actors in tourism are unable to conserve and protect tourism sites. Achieving the SDGs requires collaboration between international actors, governments, the private sector, and locals in an inclusive governance based on justice, inclusion trust and equitable power relations.

The report of 19th CPC National Congress indicates that China is committed to proactive mitigation under the Paris Agreement and further participating in global environmental governance under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and both of which are largely integrated to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). BRI are also closely linked with South-South environmental and climate cooperation proposed by China from previous UN summits. Based on shared ideas, intersected agendas, and compatible governance approaches, BRI and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development grow increasingly relevant and they might form synergies based on increasingly interactive relations. In sum, seeking and intensifying the linkages between BRI and 2030 sustainable development goals (SDGs) could address global environmental governance deficits and enhance cooperation among nations.

J	Morita, K; Okitasari, M; Masuda, H				Morita, Kanako; Okitasari, Mahesti; Masuda, Hiromi			Analysis of national and local governance systems to achieve the sustainable development goals: case studies of Japan and Indonesia	SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE			English	Article						Sustainable development goals; Governance; National; Local; Japan; Indonesia	SDGS; CHALLENGES	To achieve the sustainable development goals (SDGs), all countries' efforts are essential, and each country needs to recognize their level of achievement in terms of the SDGs, identify the goals and targets that require more effort, and build more effective and well-performed governance systems to accelerate their efforts toward achieving the SDGs. This study identifies different governance system structures for achieving the SDGs and the challenges they face in improving their performance using a new matrix tool to evaluate governance systems for the SDGs. We use Japan and Indonesia as case studies to provide perspectives from countries at different levels of economic development. The results show that the governance systems for the SDGs are structurally and functionally different in the two countries, which face different challenges. Japan has relatively well-structured "vision and objective setting", "research and assessment", and "strategy development", but faces challenges in relation to "implementation" and "monitoring, evaluation, and review", while Indonesia has relatively well-structured "research and assessment", "strategy development", and "monitoring, evaluation, and review." However, Indonesia faces challenges in relation to "vision and objective setting" and "implementation." We found that the differences in the governance systems for the SDGs have arisen in relation to three key elements: differences in the development of governance systems for the SDGs, differences in the lead ministries, and the existence or otherwise of a supportive legal framework. We argue that the proposed matrix tool is useful in identifying the structure of governance systems for the SDGs and the challenges that must be overcome to improve the performance of these systems. However, some analytical limitations must be overcome before the tool can be applied to other countries.

In this sense, smart cities present themselves as a viable solution to aggregate public resources, human capital, social capital and information, and communication technologies, to promote sustainable development. In this context, this research aims at analyzing the influence of the factors of Smart Governance on the Quality of Life in the context of the smart cities. This study is characterized as quantitative research, of a descriptive nature, made possible by means of a survey applied to 829 inhabitants of a city in the Northeast of Brazil. For the analysis of the data, we used multivariate data techniques, with the application of Structural Equation Modeling methodology. This study aims to analyze the influence of Smart Governance factors on Quality of Life in the context of smart cities, in the Northeastern region of Brazil. To that end, Transparency, Collaboration, Participation and partnership, Communication and Accountability on Quality of Life relationships were measured. The results of the research indicate intense and important relations among the constructs. Among the research findings, we highlight the identification of strategic drivers that can help the smart city rulers in the development of public policies and actions of the municipal executive that involves the population to achieve sustainable development goals. It is noteworthy that the research findings contribute to improving the governance of smart cities, in order to improve citizens' quality of life. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This synergy brings forth sheer implications on the sustainable economic development. On this composite setting, the paper examines several fundamental credentials of public administration in the European Union (EU) countries, in relation to economic development, but also poverty, research, and development support, as representative socio-economic credentials. The empirical analysis is based on data covering the 1995-2017 lapse of time, processed through three econometric procedures, namely robust regression, structural equation modeling, and Gaussian graphical models. The main results emphasize that there are significant joint implications of public administration on the considered socio-economic dimensions. General government spending and, particularly, the environmental support, have positive implications on the European Union economies, leading to significant increases in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita and downsize in poverty risk (more emphasized in regard to the government expenditures than the environmental protection). Overall, the quality of governance in EU countries requires an additional effort dedicated to leverage good public governance in order to support the long-term economic development.

J	Jiang, Y				Jiang, Yong			Financing water investment for global sustainable development: Challenges, innovation, and governance strategies	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Review; Early Access						commercial finance; development; finance innovation; sustainable development goals; water finance; water investment	INFRASTRUCTURE; FINANCIALIZATION	Water is central to sustainable development as established in the official report of the High Level Panel on Water of the United Nations and World Bank. Such strategic importance of water justifies global demand for investment from all sources in the water sector to not only provide much needed infrastructure but also enhance the capacity of management and governance necessary to cope with complex water problems and risks, particularly under changing conditions characterized by climate change, urbanization, and environmental degradation. Yet, how to finance the investment need to build a strong water sector for sustainability is a practical question that has been gaining wide attention globally. This paper synthesizes current knowledge and understanding of water investment finance. It examines and characterizes water finance and challenges, encompassing economics and practice of financing water investment needs, the commonly considered finance model, and barriers for water finance in relation to the unique features of water investment needs and the water sector. It introduces some promising practices adopted or advocated to address the financing challenges, and highlights key governance and institutional strategies to help bridge the funding gap in the water sector. Based on the synthesis, the paper offers some discussion on the water finance issue in the end. This paper hopes to connect academia and development practice to stimulate communication while informing policy and management reform to better promote financing water investment for sustainability.

J	de Jong, E; Vijge, MJ				de Jong, Eileen; Vijge, Marjanneke J.			From Millennium to Sustainable Development Goals: Evolving discourses and their reflection in policy coherence for development	EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE			English	Article						Sustainable development; Discourses; Sustainable Development Goals; Millennium Development Goals; The Netherlands; Policy coherence for development; Governance through global goals	HUMAN-RIGHTS; MDGS; POLITICS; LESSONS; AGENDA; FUTURE; WATER	The discourse of sustainable development is highly influential in global and national governance frameworks, though its meaning and operationalisation are context-dependent and have evolved over time. The transition from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) reflects the most recent evolution in this discourse. We analyse key differences in storylines between the MDGs and SDGs and develop an analytical framework to study these, focusing on the objectives of sustainable development, the means to reach those objectives, and the relations between developing and developed countries. We use this framework in quantitative and qualitative discourse analyses of the policy coherence for development (PCD) approach of the Netherlands. This shows that global discourses are closely reflected in national-level policy frameworks. During the MDG era, the key objective of sustainable development was poverty reduction to be reached through economic growth and participation in the global trade system. The SDGs aim for a broader set of objectives across the full spectrum of the economic, social and environmental dimensions. This is reflected in the Dutch PCD approach, first through a conceptualisation of environmental and social safeguards for trade and economic growth, and later with social and environmental sustainability as equally important objectives alongside poverty reduction. While the MDGs mainly focus on national averages and the poorest, the SDGs target the most marginalised and vulnerable groups with a focus on disaggregate data. In this respect, the Netherlands was ahead of its time; already in the early 2000s it acknowledged that "there is no question of "the" developing countries". Related to this, the Dutch PCD approach also reflects the changed conceptualisation of the relations between developing and developed countries. This changed from aid to developing countries as reflected in the MDGs, toward partnerships with them, initially for the purpose of stimulating economic growth and trade, later also aimed at environmental sustainability. The article ends with a reflection on how our research findings contribute to debates around (the effectiveness of) governance through global goals, as well as to understanding the political nature of policy coherence for (sustainable) development.

This special volume shows that collaboration is indeed one of the preferred forms of governance to manage relations between firms in a sustainability context. Collaboration enhances sustainable benefits by creating legitimacy of sustainable technologies, reducing waste and improving environmental and social performance of firms. The institutional environment, in particular environmental laws and regulations, has a beneficial impact on collaboration and relationship management in sustainable supply chains. Two studies in this special volume show, however, that stringent environmental regulations may hinder economic performance and result in outsourcing to foreign suppliers with potential detrimental effects for environmental performance. These negative effects can be overcome by firms that invest in sustainable innovation. This special volume also shows that eco-innovation leads to sustainable benefits, such as lower greenhouse gas emissions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The study compares the BES in Emilia Romagna and Hedmark. At first, bioenergy was expected to mitigate climate change and to tackle the crisis of the primary sectors and related industries. However, bioenergy policies were not equipped to address cross-sectoral and multilevel issues. Therefore, they failed to secure the local, sustainable development. Critical weaknesses lie in BES governance. Actors' discourses, rules, and power issues form a complex structure that influences the bioenergy policy process and its outcomes. The study relies on systems thinking and system dynamics, and the pathways approach. It uses the system archetypes to investigate the bioenergy policy feedback dynamics and how to leverage local, sustainable development. Results show that power relations and social opposition are critical to a policy change that best secures local, sustainable development.

J	Siegel, KM; Lima, MGB				Siegel, Karen M.; Lima, Mairon G. Bastos			When international sustainability frameworks encounter domestic politics: The sustainable development goals and agri-food governance in South America	WORLD DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Sustainable Development Goals; Agri-food governance; Inclusiveness; South America; International norms; Soybean	LATIN-AMERICA; SECURITY; SDGS; AGRIBUSINESS; EXPANSION; DYNAMICS; SYSTEMS	The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have been heralded as a landmark achievement and a major opportunity for transformative and inclusive change towards sustainability. This promise, however, remains largely unverified. To help fill this gap, we examine how the SDGs have been taken up in the domestic politics of agri-food governance - a salient and contested policy area - in three South American countries: Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. Our empirical assessment is based on a scoping of the institutions set up for domestic SDG governance, document analysis of the first voluntary national reviews on the SDGs, and 63 key-informant interviews. The analysis shows that the ability of the SDGs to strengthen inclusiveness is largely shaped by domestic politics, pre-existing institutions and power relations, as well as the resources, capacities and prior experiences of civil society and subnational governments. In practice, the SDGs' emphasis on inclusion does not necessarily mean that a wider range of perspectives are taken into account in domestic contexts. In Paraguay, the implementation of the SDGs so far mirrors the patterns of marginalization evident also in other policy processes. In Uruguay and Brazil, the SDGs have offered possibilities for at least drawing attention to a variety of perspectives by strengthening the already existing, fairly open political institutions in the case of Uruguay, and by opening up a space for contestation by civil society organizations and subnational governments in the case of Brazil. The SDGs may then be an opportunity for change, but there is also a risk that they become a justification for business as usual. Actors now employ metonymy as a tactic, cherry-picking preferred goals or targets as a sign of supposed adherence to the whole 2030 Agenda. Further research is needed with more ex-post analyses of the SDGs beyond the praising of their nominal transformative potential. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In order to achieve the purpose of this research, we analysed both annual and sustainability reports issued in the period 2017-2018 by the listed entities in the banking field in Romania included in the study by using a scoring system to rank the compliance with the principles and provisions of CGC regarding the responsibilities of the board, risk management and internal control system, fair rewards and motivation and building value through investors relations. Our analysis reflects that, although the provisions and principles issued by the Corporate Governance Code are not mandatory for the listed companies, they are largely implemented in the activity of banking companies in order to increase the level of transparency and trust, essential elements for a sustainable development.

Based on their sustained economic growth, Asian-Pacific cities have played a transformative role in the region, and are on the forefront of economic, social, political, and informational and technological change. However, they are also characterized by widespread urban poverty and inequality, enormous deficiencies in access to shelter and services, and deteriorating quality of the urban environment. The New Urban Agenda (NUA) aims to address the main issues faced by cities and human settlements around the world today, and outlines key principles and commitments towards addressing them. First, this chapter contextualises the NUA vis-a-vis the key sustainable and inclusive urban development issues worldwide. Second, it systematically reviews the idea of governance, and its evolution and theoretical underpinnings since the early 1980s in relation to the changing emphases of overseas development aid. Likewise, it provides insights into the ideas and literature related to governance, decentralization and democratization, and their relevance to cities. Third, the chapter juxtaposes the NUA with the urban realities of the Asia-Pacific region, and reviews three areas of immediate concern: (i) urban governance as an umbrella to respond to urban challenges, (ii) urban planning and policy, and (iii) service delivery and access for social inclusion. In doing so, it highlights the latest tenets of the global urban agenda that are articulated in the NUA, and Sustainable Development Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. Finally, by providing a brief introduction to the various chapters, it explains how they are organized in the following three sections of the book: (i) urban planning and policy, (ii) innovations in service delivery and access for social inclusion, and (iii) emerging trends and future trajectories.

Transitioning towards a Sustainable Wellbeing Economy-Implications for Rural-Urban Relations	LAND			English	Article						sustainable wellbeing; rural-urban relations; land management; local government; governance; policy; case studies; Europe		This article focuses on the question of how a shift from a narrow economic perspective to a wider sustainable wellbeing focus in regional development strategies and actions might change rural-urban relations. A brief review of relevant research and discourses about economic development models provides the foundation for the analysis. The review leads to the development of an analytical framework that puts the notion of sustainable wellbeing at its center. The criteria included in the analytical framework are then used to assess the current situation, challenges and perceived ways forward based on data and analyses from 11 European regions. The focus of the analysis is on different expressions of a sustainable wellbeing economy, and aspects of territorial development that are consistent with the basic features of a wellbeing economy are identified. Development dynamics and tensions between different development goals and resource uses, strategies and actions that are in favor of sustainable wellbeing goals, and conditions for more mutually beneficial rural-urban relationships are discussed. The article concludes with the implications for local government, and governance and policy frameworks. Reference is made to current high-level strategic policy frameworks and the European Green Deal.

J	Foster, EA				Foster, Emma A.			Sustainable Development: Problematising Normative Constructions of Gender within Global Environmental Governmentality	GLOBALIZATIONS			English	Article						sustainable development; environmental governance; gender; heteronormativity; Foucault; governmentality		Systems of governance are legitimised as an almost indispensable response to global co-ordination over matters of environmental degradation. Considering sustainable development as the key label for 'common-sense' political approaches to environmental degradation and a key informant for international environmental policy-making activity, this article seeks to problematise such a widespread discourse as (re) productive of (hetero)sexist power relations. As such, this article, informed by Foucault's conceptions of governmentality and biopower, contends that the global thrust towards sustainable development projects works to construct identities and discipline power relations with regard to gender and sexuality. Specifically, I argue that the disciplinary narratives and apparatuses of international sustainable development initiatives work to construct gendered identities and naturalise heterosexual relations. To demonstrate this, this article focuses on the discourses surrounding one of the most important international documents directed at informing national environmental policy, Agenda 21.

J	Dahlbeck, J				Dahlbeck, Johan			Hope and fear in education for sustainable development	CRITICAL STUDIES IN EDUCATION			English	Article						education for sustainable development; fear; future; governance; hope		Education for sustainable development represents a politically prioritized area of knowledge in contemporary Swedish education and as such it has acquired a prominent position among the governing values of educational policy. Insofar as education for sustainable development is directed at securing the future of human well-being, this article suggests that it concerns a moral discourse where notions about what may or may not happen in the future plays an important role in the governance of practices and behaviors in the present. Since the future is shrouded in uncertainty, it is suggested that the emotions of hope and fear may be understood in terms of tools for governing the everyday lives of children, invoking alluring and deterrent images that influence their decision-making. Besides seeking to gain a better understanding of some of the preconditions of education for sustainable development, the aim of this article concerns an investigation into some of the effects that education for sustainable development may have on the lives of children. To this end, it looks at how hope and fear are being put into play within the discourse as strategies for governing individuals in relation to the uncertainty of the future.

Towards More Balanced Territorial Relations-The Role (and Limitations) of Spatial Planning as a Governance Approach	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						urban; peri-urban; rural; spatial planning; territorial governance; sustainable development; case studies; Europe	BOUNDARIES; DENMARK; SWEDEN	Decision-makers, planners and administrators involved in different policy domains at different governance levels face the important challenge of fostering more balanced, sustainable and territorially integrated development. Well-designed, multi-level, multi-sector and multi-actor governance arrangements can play a key role in this process through orchestrating the interplay between different spheres, activities, actors and interests. In this paper, we examine the role of spatial planning in improving the relations between rural, peri-urban and urban areas. We analyse the strengths and limitations of spatial planning and explore the connections with territorial development. The methodology used for this analysis combines regional case studies in seven European locations-Ede, Frankfurt/Rhein-Main, Styria/Graz, Helsinki, Lisbon, Lucca and Mid Wales, with rapid appraisals, the analysis of published data, expert judgement and triangulation. We ask under which conditions spatial planning can induce more balanced, sustainable territorial relations, and look at the contribution planning can make to achieving sustainable development goals. The problem of ineffective (or toothless) plan implementation provides the entry point into the analysis and discussion. We illustrate why mutually beneficial relations between urban, peri-urban and rural communities (and territories) cannot simply be planned. Instead, these relationships need to be supported by strategies, policy instruments and governance arrangements that foster synergies between different actors and activities. The planning process itself needs to become more transparent and participatory. We conclude that the questions addressed in this article in an exploratory fashion merit further research especially as a more sustainable and territorially integrated development is becoming increasingly important in European policy making.

J	Fomin, MV				Fomin, Maxim V.			SUSTAINABLE (UN) DEVELOPMENT	MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA			Russian	Article						sustainable development; best available techniques (BAT); industry; tenor of technology; environment; competitiveness; decentralized system of governance		Scope of research: the triad of Russia's sustainable development up to 2035 (economic, social and environmental issues). The given period is expected to be marked by significant instability, both in relations between different nations and between different groups inside nations, such as proponents and opponents of modernization, or groups promoting dissimilar ideas and forms of modernization. In addition, - and this is a point on which almost all open-access analytical papers and forecasts concur, in this period, the world will face various challenges including: depletion of natural resources (primarily hydrocarbons); critical level of anthropogenic stress in a number of countries; overpopulation and increased consumption in developing countries; food security risks; continued desertification and fresh water shortages; higher risks of man-made disasters as well as new infections and epidemics. This paper proposes two scenarios for Russia's environmental situation development up to 2035. According to the first scenario, titled "Black Hole", Russian authorities will not pay sufficient attention to sustainable development and, for that matter, efficient use of natural resources and environmental security, even though the country's energy sources will start to wane. According to the second scenario, titled "Era of Real Changes", issues of socio-economic development, energy security and environmental pollution will attract more and more attention at all government levels. All types of environmental pollution will become taxable, which will urge polluters to embrace best available techniques/technologies (BAT). In conclusion, the author provides an analysis of this research outcomes and emphasizes the key role of timely BAT incorporation to keep industries alive and enable sustainable development of the country. The importance of a decentralized federal system of governance is also highlighted, whereby environmental issues can and must be addressed, in the first place, at the regional level. Finally, the author has devised the first ever principles for a new sustainable development model - "Honest development".

The problem of dimensioning this development in relation to government actions determines the objective of analyzing the existence of a correlation between the indicators of governance of the countries calculated by the World Bank (WGI) and the human development index calculated by the United Nations (IDH). To investigate this hypothesis, correlation analyzes were performed between HDI and the six governance dimensions of WGI. The results of the research confirm the existence of a significant positive correlation between the HDI and the WGI, thus establishing the understanding of the complementarity of these indicators and the possibility of their use in the establishment of governmental actions.

J	Sedlacek, S				Sedlacek, Sabine			The role of universities in fostering sustainable development at the regional level	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Universities; Sustainable development; Regions; Governance; University of Graz; Regional centres of expertise	INDUSTRY-GOVERNMENT RELATIONS; TRIPLE-HELIX; TRANSDISCIPLINARITY; GOVERNANCE; EDUCATION; MANAGEMENT; TRANSITION; SYSTEMS	Universities have a key influence on society in a two-fold manner: they train and educate people and they participate in governance at the national and regional level. This paper focuses on universities and how they function to foster sustainable development. It identifies their actual and potential roles in fulfilling educational, research, governance, and economic development functions, as well as facilitative and mediating functions. A set of seven hypotheses has been derived from the literature and used to develop an analytical framework for considering the three main functions: education, research and governance. The framework distinguishes the individual and the societal educational functions, knowledge creation and knowledge transfer within the research function, and finally the internal and external governance functions. This framework has been applied to a particular case study - the University of Graz, which hosts a Regional Centre of Expertise on Education for Sustainable Development. The case study analysis allowed a first test of the hypotheses. For this specific case a couple of prerequisites were identified as helping universities act as facilitators for sustainable development at the regional level. A diverse institutional set-up, a committed leadership as well as alliances with particular bridging organizations such as the Regional Centres of Expertise on Education for Sustainable Development are only a few of the factors that were found to be facilitative in the case under study.

J	Kadfak, A; Antonova, A				Kadfak, Alin; Antonova, Anna			Sustainable Networks: Modes of governance in the EU's external fisheries policy relations under the IUU Regulation in Thailand and the SFPA with Senegal	MARINE POLICY			English	Article						EU; Fisheries governance; Sustainability; Thailand; IUU fishing; Senegal; Bilateral agreements	NORMATIVE POWER EUROPE; UNION; PARTNERSHIP; AFRICA; AGREEMENTS; WEST	The EU envisions itself as a global leader in sustainable fisheries governance. This paper explores how two key policies seek to implement these aspirations internationally - the Illegal, Unregulated, and Unreported (IUU) regulation and the Sustainable Fishing Partnership Agreements (SFPAs). We draw on case studies in Thailand and Senegal to examine the specific mechanisms through which the EU influences fisheries governance beyond its territory, respectively through the IUU regulation and SFPAs. Drawing on normative power literature, we argue that the EU utilises network and market modes of governance to translate normative environmental values into third country regulations as part of dialogue and negotiation processes. In particular, we expand on the functioning of the network mode of governance by looking at how the EU has used socialisation and partnership approaches to promote certain values during its dialogues with both countries. In Thailand, the EU helped promote fisheries reform through its IUU yellow card mechanism, but its influence has at times been criticised as too directive. Meanwhile, the latest iteration of the EU's bilateral fishing relations with Senegal under the new SFPA scheme shows promising improvement compared to previous versions, but remains complicated by the two countries' relative power imbalance. Overall, our paper seeks to enrich the engagement of fisheries governance literature with questions of EU relations with third countries. Our two case studies demonstrate how exploring the functioning of normative aspects is significant particularly because the advancement of sustainability in global fisheries depends on concrete, historically complex, and multilaterally constructed power relations.

Hence, additional work in sustainability metrics development that informs the investment sector of sustainable performance in companies would be of key importance. This article argues that there remain gaps in EU leadership for governing metrics development, and suggests that EU-level governance can be designed appropriately, especially in a multi-stakeholder manner, for metrics development and in relation to key information intermediaries in this space.

The attitude and behavior of the government are essential to the sustainable development of PPP projects. This research focuses on the deep-seated connotation of the external attitude and behavior of the government, that is, the impact mechanism and path of the government's relation orientation on project sustainability. First, enrich the connotation of the government's relation orientation, project sustainability, and project governance, and improve the measurement scale. Then, construct a structural equation model, collect data through questionnaires, and explore the path of the government's relation orientation on project sustainability. The research results show that: (1) different relation orientations have different effects on project governance and project sustainability, among which instrumental relation orientation and rent-seeking relation orientation will directly affect project sustainability; (2) relationship governance and contract governance play different mediating roles. The research results provide new ideas and perspectives for improving project governance mechanisms and project sustainability in the practice of PPP projects in China.

To achieve Sustainable Development Goals, the UN identifies innovation as one of the important elements. Motivated by this, we explore how board size affects firm's innovation and find a negative relation between board size and firm's innovation. Our analyses including ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions, instrumental variable, propensity score matching, and generalized method of moment (GMM) dynamic panel data estimation show that our results are robust and are not driven by unobserved heterogeneity. Our findings are consistent with stewardship theory where a smaller board leads to more corporate innovation, which eventually leads to sustainable firms.

J	Bothello, J; Mehrpouya, A				Bothello, Joel; Mehrpouya, Afshin			Between regulatory field structuring and organizational roles: Intermediation in the field of sustainable urban development	REGULATION & GOVERNANCE			English	Article						governance; intermediation; rule-intermediary; sustainable development	CONFIGURING EVENTS; GOVERNANCE; STANDARDS; ACCOUNTABILITY; STRATEGIES; EMERGENCE; POLITICS; MARKETS; COMPLEX; REGIME	Recent contributions in the domains of governance and regulation elucidate the importance of rule-intermediation (RI), the role that organizations adopt to bridge actors with regulatory or "rulemaking" roles and those with target or "rule-taking" roles. Intermediation not only enables the diffusion and translation of regulatory norms, but also allows for the representation of different actors in policymaking arenas. While prior studies have explored the roles that such RIs adopt to facilitate their intermediation functions, we have yet to consider how field-level structuring processes influence (and are influenced by) the various and changing roles adopted by RI. In this study we focus on the mutually constitutive relations between field-level change processes and the evolving roles of RIs by studying the rise of the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI)/Local Governments for Sustainability, an RI serving as a bridge for sustainable urban development policies between the United Nations and local authorities. Using ICLEI as an illustrative case, we theorize four different processes of regulatory field structuration: problematization, role specialization, marketization, and orchestrated decentralization. We discuss their implications for RI roles in the field and further theorize the changing dynamics of trickle-up intermediation processes as an RI gains power and influence.

While current project management techniques are well defined in terms of content and process to manage the budget-scope-time constraint, availability of organization resources and ability to adopt project governance strategies in a changing business environment, like incorporating sustainability in business process is ambiguous, literature has not explored how to cope with a normative situation like sustainability. We consider Small-to-Mid-Size-Construction-Organizations (SMSCOs), which makes up the largest portion of the project-based industry and are most impacted by new government regulations, as our population of interest. This paper addresses two primary objectives in relation to organizational resources available for SMSCOs: to identify an organization's shortcomings in undertaking a sustainable project, and to identify means for improving organizational readiness to cope with governance of sustainable projects. A case study with a SMSCO to understand activities, resource availability, and how to improve organization readiness to undertake projects related to sustainability is discussed. A conceptual framework is presented for the adoptive project governance process to ensure resource constrained organizations like SMSCO's can align better to govern such projects.

Based on an extensive literature review, a conceptual framework of the function of NGOs in environmental governance is developed, focusing on five core aspects - role, power, accountability, legitimacy and acceptance - that define the position of NGOs in a governance system in relation to other stakeholders. The World Green Building Council's (WGBC's) global environmental governance movement has been identified as a dynamic market-driven governance system. Thus, the paper explores the role of regional green building councils (RGBCs) listed in the WGBC's directory within this newly deployed governance system. The results confirm the proposition that RGBCs grow in their governance and third-party role as they progress through the development stages proposed by the WGBC.

J	Sun, YP; Razzaq, A				Sun, Yunpeng; Razzaq, Asif			Composite fiscal decentralisation and green innovation: Imperative strategy for institutional reforms and sustainable development in OECD countries	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						composite fiscal decentralisation; environmental sustainability; green innovation; institutional governance; sustainable development	CO2 EMISSIONS; RENEWABLE ENERGY; ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE; QUANTILE REGRESSION; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; IMPACT; POLICY; POPULATION; FEDERALISM; GOVERNANCE	Improving environmental quality and fiscal management has become one of the utmost imperative policy agendas for sustainable development. Although many studies explore multiple deriving factors of environmental sustainability; however, very little is known regarding the impact of composite (revenue and expenditure) fiscal decentralisation (FD) on environmental quality. Manifestly, the intergovernmental fiscal relations advocate to ensure the alignment of tax and spending powers to promote sustainable and inclusive growth. Therefore, we explore the asymmetric linkages between composite FD, green innovation, institutional governance and carbon emissions in 32 OECD countries. Our preliminary results confirm non-linearity and structural changes in data, which instigate us to apply the asymmetric method of moments quantile regression. The overall findings exhibit that composite FD significantly mitigates carbon emissions only at medium to higher (5th-9th) emissions quantiles. In contrast, green innovation reduces carbon emissions from lower to medium (1st-5th) emissions quantiles. Institutional reforms promote environmental sustainability across all emissions quantiles (1st-9th). Interestingly, the emissions-reducing effect of composite FD, green innovation and institutional governance is highest for higher emissions quantiles and lowest for lower emissions quantiles. These results provide valuable policy recommendations for all stakeholders.

Advancing sustainable development goals through interdisciplinarity in sustainable tourism research	JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM			English	Article; Early Access						Sustainable tourism; sustainable development goals; interdisciplinary; structural topic modeling; knowledge development	KNOWLEDGE; GENDER; CITATIONS; TRENDS; DISCIPLINE; GOVERNANCE; AUSTRALIA; SCIENCE; TOPICS; POLICY	The sustainable development goals (SDGs) address multifaceted problems that lie at the intersection between natural and socio-economic systems. While scholars agree that interdisciplinary research is needed to advance the SDGs, the concept of interdisciplinarity itself has been given limited attention. This article explores the interdisciplinarity of research published in the Journal of Sustainable Tourism using references cited by the journal's articles. We use structural topic modeling to analyze research trends. The findings suggest that the research has become more interdisciplinary, however, knowledge is defined primarily by tourism studies and the business management discipline. To advance the SDGs, researchers should engage with disciplines such as anthropology and the humanities that can bring critical issues such as power relations and socio-cultural values to the forefront of sustainability discourses. Research should also conceptualize the SDGs as a network of targets to facilitate the integration of sustainable tourism outcomes with broader development goals.

The expectations for rapid transformations have not materialized, and hence a strategy combining both incremental and more radical changes is needed. Such strategies have been discussed in other fields, but they have been largely unaddressed in relation to sustainable development. This article seeks to increase understanding of how changes of various sizes interact in sustainable development policy. Here, we utilize the concept of small wins as concrete, implemented and often incremental changes that can create momentum for larger-scale changes. By analyzing key government documents and reports, interviews, questionnaires and workshop material, we study Finland's sustainable development policy. We focus on changes in the realms of the 4Is, meaning institutions, interests, information and ideas. Based on the research, Finland has been particularly successful in building multi-sectoral institutions and mainstreaming the idea of sustainable development. There is a vast information base available. In practice, however, various conflicts of interest remain unsolved. We conclude that while a sustainable development policy based solely on small wins can be too slow and incremental to meet the major sustainability challenges of our time, it would pave the way for more transformative reforms. These include, for example, the current Government Programme based on the idea of sustainable development and challenging the status quo on various fronts.

The reforms being carried through are unprecedented as until then nothing similar had occurred in the world and nobody was able to conclude an explicit plan or rules of reforms or to make precise estimations. Now, 15 years later, the results of the reforms that often were being carried through in a chaotic way and without clearly defined strategies may be reviewed. The processes and cardinal changes that took place in political, social and economic spheres covered all fields of life and had major impact on economic, physical, social, and human resources. Based on empirical data on income, energy consumption, pollution variation and some social indicators of Lithuanian residents, the article examines economic, ecologic and social components of development and, grounded on models, carries out the analysis of their evolution and the compatibility of processes with the priorities of sustainable development. The aim of the article is to assess the present social-economic situation, trends and threats that might have significant negative influence over further course of reforms.

Improving Sustainable Development within Indonesian Palm Oil: The Importance of the Reward System	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						global production network; governance; sustainable palm oil; reward system; Indonesia	GLOBAL PRODUCTION NETWORKS; VALUE CHAINS; GOVERNANCE; STANDARDS; SECTOR	Nowadays, standards play a central role in the governance of international business relations; palm oil is no exception. The focal issue of palm oil is sustainable processes of production and sourcing, thus multi-stakeholder initiatives such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) set out the sustainability principles and standards, and manage the certification system (CSPO). Empirical evidence based on in-depth interview with various stakeholders in the Indonesian palm oil industry indicates that the development of the RSPO sustainability standards is perceived to be in favor of a particular interest group due to the asymmetrical power and unbalanced control structure of the stakeholders. Thus the powerful stakeholders are able to exercise imperative power over other stakeholders, to the extent that it actually contradicts the others' interests. This paper puts forward the notion that a more equitable governance system should be developed through the introduction of the reward system on the CSPO transaction. The reward system can demonstrate the original motivation of the RSPO toward consensus among all stakeholders to equally contribute in the implementation of sustainability Principles and Criteria (P&C) and standards.

J	Zhao, XK; Li, YJ; Xu, FC; Dong, KX				Zhao, Xiukun; Li, Yongjian; Xu, Fangchao; Dong, Kunxiang			Sustainable collaborative marketing governance mechanism for remanufactured products with extended producer responsibility	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Sustainability; Extended producer responsibility; Supply chain governance; Remanufactured products; Collaborative marketing	LOOP SUPPLY CHAIN; CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; DESIGN; COMPETITION	The marketing of remanufactured products has been receiving increasing attention from scholars and practitioners from the perspective of sustainable supply chain governance (SSCG) and extended producer responsibility (EPR). However, the research on remanufactured product marketing under EPR and SSCG mechanisms remains more new exploration. A mathematical model for remanufactured product marketing through the lenses of the Nash and Stackelberg game theory and the SSCG and EPR theories is proposed to deepen this issue in the literature based on the case of Caterpillar (CAT), which is a benchmark producer that markets remanufactured products successfully. Findings include the characterization of three marketing decision models with EPR, namely, decentralized marketing decision under the weak dependence relation model, decentralized marketing decision under the strong dependence relation model, and collaborative marketing decision under the strong dependence relation model. Furthermore, this paper includes a classification of marketing governance mechanisms on the basis of the relation between CAT and its retailer and the identification of factors that sustain collaborative marketing governance mechanisms. The managerial insights obtained are useful to practitioners who are seeking for sustainable collaborative marketing governance mechanisms for remanufactured products under EPR and to scholars for further theory development.

The complex character of sustainability requires the participation of many societal spheres to resolve them. Sustainable Development Goal #17 "Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development" recognizes multi-stakeholder partnerships as important vehicles for mobilizing and sharing knowledge, expertise, technologies, and financial resources to support the achievement of the SDGs in all countries. Innovation Ecosystems (IE) are dynamic purposive multi-stakeholders' networks with complex relationships built on trust, co-creation of value, and exchange of complementary technologies or competencies. Few studies investigated the IEs relating to sustainability and specially within the SDGs. This study provides a descriptive analysis of the relationship between IE and the SDGs, concerning the question about how the IE framework can orient the SDG #17 partnership implementation. The methodology is based on the literature review and analysis of documents from the United Nations, available at the UN Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform - 2021. Four core drivers were identified and discussed: Geographical Governance, Collaboration, Knowledge Transmission, and Value co-creation. Considering the IE lens, the SDGs can be addressed as the purpose engaging the Major Groups, which are the key contributors in terms of being part of the challenges and solutions. There is a need to prepare stakeholders to be ecosystem conscious and aware of the demanded innovations. Future research should include describing methods to measure IE performance considering the SDGs and empirical studies to analyze the ecosystem roles and relations of the Major Groups.

It traces the region's predatory state-society relations to slavery and colonialism and the concomitant extractive institutions, which are not conducive to sustainable economic development. Consequently, attempts to achieve sustainable development have been largely futile. The paper proposes a strategy for transforming the region's economic and governance institutions for inclusive and enduring growth and development. This strategy includes the promulgation and enforcement of coherent international codes and guidelines for state-society relations.

In this paper, we have undertaken a systematic scoping review of the English-language literature (2014-2019) on metropolitanisation and metropolitan governance, with a view to understanding the potential relationship with more sustainable land management. Our scoping review identified several dominant trends within current research on metropolitanisation and metropolitan governance illustrating the complexity between sustainable land management and issues of territorial politics, resourcing, and power relations. The centrality of collaborative working relationships in supporting sustainable land management is identified, yet collaboration and effective metropolitan scale governance is not always an easy task or readily implemented. The paper identifies a series of challenges and concludes that while there is general consensus that the metropolitan arena may be an appropriate scale through which to support more sustainable land management, there is no agreement on the mechanisms to enable this. Steering and more strongly directing metropolitanisation processes through either formal metropolitan governance structures or other tools could provide a potential approach but will require significant adaptation in power and funding structures.

These instruments are critically examined in terms of how they might help to promote greater policy integration and more sustainable development. Five types of strategies for promoting more sustainable transport policies are discussed: (1) policy indicators and targets, (2) benchmarking, (3) policy transfer and best practices, (4) policy experimentation/innovation, and (5) visioning/envisioning. The article is divided into four main parts. First, it presents an overview of recent trends in the governance of urban transport. Second, it examines the notion of policy integration, a central theme in discussions about sustainable transport and governance. Third, it considers how selected types of policy instruments might contribute to policy integration and sustainable urban development. Fourth, alongside the conclusions, suggestions are made for new research related to policy instruments and soft forms of governance in relation to urban transport.

J	Ritts, M; Simpson, M				Ritts, Max; Simpson, Michael			Smart oceans governance: Reconfiguring capitalist, colonial, and environmental relations	TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF BRITISH GEOGRAPHERS			English	Article; Early Access						capitalism; colonial relation; environmental governance; smart ocean; state	BLUE ECONOMY; POLITICS; TRACKING; TERRITORY; KNOWLEDGE; CANADA; SPACE	How does the digitisation of the ocean reconfigure capitalist, colonial, and environmental relations? What analytic tools allow us to trace their intersecting dynamics? These are the central questions that we take up through an examination of smart oceans governance along the west coast of Canada, where the state is developing new institutional partnerships to manage the expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure across unceded Indigenous lands and waters. In this context, laden with environmental risks and resurgent anti-colonial politics, state actors are implicating smart oceans governance in efforts to harmonise capitalist growth with sustainability mandates and the 'recognition' of Indigenous self-determination. Our analysis draws on environmental state theory, critical indigenous studies, and human geographies of the ocean, to analyse interviews, Access to Information requests, scientific studies, and policy reports. Our findings suggest that smart oceans governance poses novel risks to Indigenous peoples and their distinctive 'seascape epistemologies'. At the same time, we observe in this medium new limits to the state's ability to consolidate settler colonial authority and extend possessive colonial entitlements to Indigenous lands and waters. First Nations are also engaging with smart oceans governance in ways that assert 'Indigenous data sovereignty', help chart their own political and territorial ambitions, and carve out meaningful spaces of Indigenous marine stewardship.

We aim to better understand the search for concerted action in multi-actor arrangements. Therefore, this paper presents a diagnostic framework with three strategic challenges the partnership projects are facing: linking global economic objectives to local needs, values and interests; bridging public and private interests and responsibilities; and seeking trade-offs between social, environmental and economic values. Starting from the partnerships' Theory of Change, this diagnostic framework is applied to comparative case studies of partnership projects in the cocoa sector in Indonesia, which are part of a Northern-based public-private partnership to improve farmers' prospective. It is concluded that the economic reality faced by the farmers differs from that of the Northern actors; collaboration with governments is difficult because of different organizational cultures; and the partnership projects underestimate the strength of vested social relations the smallholders are part of. Overall, the initiators of the partnerships seem to work with a too restricted economic interpretation of the local reality.

In this context, society depends on fertile soils and their long-term maintenance because of their various ecosystem services. So far, little is known about how soils should be governed to ensure their long-term vitality and sustainable use within a bioeconomy. This article reviews the existing literature on soil governance and outlines topics for future research. The current knowledge about the relation of state and non-state actors and different levels within soil governance are presented. Different instrument types and deficits of existing instruments in soil governance are discussed. Soil governance is an underdeveloped research field and deserves more attention in environmental and natural resource governance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper the authors analyses questions, which are related to the sustainable economical development and emphasize ethical aspects of this path of economy. The article evaluates the ethical aspects of sustainability. According to the collected theoretical and practical material, the perspectives of future developments in sustainability from the viewpoint of principles of sustainable development management and ethical behaviour systems are reviewed. Ethical aspects are very important, because now the humanity is faced with the principle problem-to have or not to have the future. Nowadays, if we want to make economical decisions, it is not enough to have sufficient economical information and narrow criterion of economical efficiency. We need to have other criteria-ecological, ethical-that are very important for the sustainable development of the world. Ecological-ethical imperative shows the limit, beyond which the harmonious life becomes impossible. The concept of the sustainable development, without which it is impossible to imagine discussions about the environment and development, is a real alternative in the economical theory to the neoclassical growth theory, speaking about economical growth which means quantitative material growth of the economy. The result of man and nature conflict is the ecological problem, which is one of the most topical and urgent problems in the world. Sustainable development solutions can be ecological if a new ecological philosophy and new attitude to man and nature arise. Ecological philosophy, as a new and modern limb of philosophy, has to harmonize human and nature relations. The whole world is in the global ecological crisis caused by man, who himself generates chaos. Man himself must overcome the chaos and harmonize his life. Sustainable development must create fair and moral covenant between human and nature. But we can't solve humanity problems practically, while they are unsolved in theory and while we don't have a clear reason in ourselves. Sustainable development ideology has a task: outgeneral environmental, economical, social, mentality problems educate a new grasp in man. Sustainable development society has to educate new human understanding that your trust must be fair, honest, fight, unselfish, and full of love for humanity and nature. A value is an abstract result that a person aims to achieve. Values highlight person's individual differences by revealing his priorities set with regard to salary, payment in time and other aspects of development. Some people consider helping others as a priority (social value) or desire to acquire power (political value), whereas for others the creation of beauty in their surroundings (aesthetic value) or acquisition of knowledge (theoretical value) is more important. Every person has a unique combination of his values. People can learn about their values when analysing the history of their life, discerning the decisions of their career they have made and their influential causes.

It is changing an understanding how business is valued, putting pressure on, and also bringing opportunities for business performance. Along with the increasing weight of sustainability aspects, accessing the value of the company has become a more complex task. The literature analysis suggests different implications on the impact of sustainable development on business value, with most finding a positive relation; however, no clear measures to evaluate such impact can be distinguished. The aim of this paper is to find out the impact of sustainable development on the value of the company. Business sustainability is analysed through the aspects of Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG), which is currently the most emerging sustainability framework, with a special emphasis on governance. Meanwhile, business value is investigated through literature review by determining a range of possible internal and external measures. Panel regression analysis is considered as a method in order to discover a link between sustainable development and business value through selected time period. The results suggest that sustainable development could have a positive impact on business value in the long term.

Can the Sustainable Development Goals Green International Organisations? Sustainability Integration in the International Labour Organisation	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY & PLANNING			English	Article; Early Access						Environmental policy integration; International Labour Organisation; Sustainable Development Goals; global sustainability governance; institutional change	POVERTY REDUCTION; IDEAS; RETHINKING; POWER	In global sustainability governance, many actors have emphasised the need for policy integration across the economic, social, and environmental dimensions. In 2015, the United Nations agreed on 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to advance such integration. But have international organisations responded to this call, and can we observe any integrative effect of the SDGs? We draw on International Relations theories that incorporate change in their analysis and develop an analytical framework to assess change through the lenses of ideas, norms, and institutions. We use this framework to assess sustainability-oriented change in the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The ILO is traditionally an organisation with a primarily socio-economic mandate and hence an ideal case to study whether the SDGs had any impact after 2015 in strengthening the environmental dimension of sustainability in the ILO's institutional settings and policy development. We focus on the 2010-2019 period and conduct a systematic qualitative content analysis of primary documentary sources, complemented with expert interviews and data on operational developments. The paper concludes that there is a significant yet instrumental greening trend in the ILO's approach to sustainable development, but also a bidirectional influence between the ILO and the SDGs.

A fundamental principle of agroecology is the responsible governance of land. Yet land-as a concept, resource, and territory-is heavily contested through processes of colonization, enclosure, commodification, and financialization. The governance of land and natural resources is also intimately tied to questions of power and privilege-Who governs land? Who benefits, and who is excluded? These questions presuppose an ontological understanding of land that can also be contested: What is land, what purpose(s) does it serve, and for whom? In this article, we review key concepts at the intersection of land governance and agroecology. We take a case study approach to highlight how tensions around ontologies of land mediate agroecological futures in 2 settler-colonial contexts: Brazil and Canada. We then explore how land governance for agroecology might be experienced and understood across different land governance institutions- including relational and community commons, private property regimes, and new forms of hybrid land relations that challenge land privatization. We discuss how these land regimes influence people, landscapes, and agroecological outcomes and conclude with a consideration of the access, equity, and justice implications of different land governance approaches for sustainable food systems.

Design/methodology/approach This paper employs an integrative review methodology to assess, critique and synthesize the extant literature on the multi-stakeholder partnerships and sustainable development goals. Findings We propose a conceptual framework of multi-stakeholder partnerships to support the sustainable development goals implementation. Thus, this paper contributes to the conceptual understanding of the multi-stakeholder partnerships mechanism that enhances the sustainable development goals implementation. Research limitations/implications We propose a conceptual framework of multi-stakeholder partnerships to support the sustainable development goals implementation. Thus, this paper contributes to the conceptual understanding of the multi-stakeholder partnerships mechanism that enhances the sustainable development goals implementation. Originality/value We contend that this is one of the few early papers that contributes to the conceptual development of a collaborative multi-stakeholder partnerships paradigm by which such partnerships are formed and institutionalized among multiple interacting sectors to achieve the sustainable development goals.

Besides a range of normative and evaluative research into the CDM, scholars have applied international relations perspectives in which the CDM has been analysed as an example of global governance, engaging multiple actors across administrative levels. This paper focuses on a national government and how its activities affect the CDM market. We draw on an empirical case study of China to demonstrate how governmental action can be understood in light of national institutional factors, defined as normative, cognitive or regulative elements.

J	van Kerkhoff, LE; Lebel, L				van Kerkhoff, Lorrae E.; Lebel, Louis			Coproductive capacities: rethinking science-governance relations in a diverse world	ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY			English	Article						capacity development; coproduction; environmental governance; environmental policy; knowledge; scale; science-policy interface; sustainable development	KNOWLEDGE SYSTEMS	Tackling major environmental change issues requires effective partnerships between science and governance, but relatively little work in this area has examined the diversity of settings from which such partnerships may, or may not, emerge. In this special feature we draw on experiences from around the world to demonstrate and investigate the consequences of diverse capacities and capabilities in bringing science and governance together. We propose the concept of coproductive capacities as a useful new lens through which to examine these relations. Coproductive capacity is "the combination of scientific resources and governance capability that shapes the extent to which a society, at various levels, can operationalize relationships between scientific and public, private, and civil society institutions and actors to effect scientifically-informed social change." This recasts the relationships between science and society from notions of "gaps" to notions of interconnectedness and interplay (coproduction); alongside the societal foundations that shape what is or is not possible in that dynamic connection (capacities). The articles in this special feature apply this concept to reveal social, political, and institutional conditions that both support and inhibit high-quality environmental governance as global issues are tackled in particular places. Across these articles we suggest that five themes emerge as important to understanding coproductive capacity: history, experience, and perceptions; quality of relationships (especially in suboptimal settings); disjunct across scales; power, interests, and legitimacy; and alternative pathways for environmental governance. Taking a coproductive capacities perspective can help us identify which interventions may best enable scientifically informed, but locally sensitive approaches to environmental governance.

Advancing culture's role in sustainable development: social change through cultural policy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CULTURAL POLICY			English	Article						Consumption; culture; environment; social change; sustainable development	NATIONALISM; OBJECTIFICATION; INDUSTRIES; STRATEGIES; TRAGEDY; POWER	This paper examines the potential for cultural policy to shape sustainable development in the context of expectations arising from research and policy work on development. We use, as the basis of a critique, the categorisation of the relationship between culture and sustainable development proposed by a major study funded by the European Union, being emblematical of how researchers and policymakers understand this relationship. The critique highlights a need for multiscalar social change, towards revaluing relations with the natural world, and reforming social relations between producers and consumers. This paper locates cultural policy as an arm of governance, with the capacity to lead social change across several interdependent pathways (revaluing technological change; fostering an aesthetic appreciation and environmental ethical consciousness; and pro-social behaviour) alongside the development of more sophisticated governance frameworks. The paper further proposes that through (re)education, cultural policy can and should play a more active role in shaping social change.

J	Plata, MM				Moreno Plata, Miguel			The Paradigmatic Depletion of the Neoliberal State in Latin America: Exploring the Governance for Sustainable Development	REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA			Spanish	Article						Development Policy; Function of the State; Governance; Institutional Development; Latin America	WASHINGTON CONSENSUS	During the contemporary period, the evolution of the great majority of Latin American States has followed two main directions: neoliberalism and neopopulism. Although these political formations are based on antagonistic paradigms, both currents have a fundamental coincidence: the weakening of the institutional capacities of the State, as well as the emergence of conflicting relations between the State and other central actors, of both market, and civil society. In this context, it is necessary to explore new frameworks of analysis that enable the construction of new state institutions which guarantee autonomy and efficient cooperation between the different socio-political spheres in the modern era. The main objectives of this work are the exploration of new theoretical approaches for the resizing of the role of the State in Latin America, particularly in development policies. For it, three central themes are analyzed: 1) the theories related to the developmental State, with emphasis on the role of bureaucratic organizations, based on the review of the experience of Southeast Asian countries; 2) the analysis of some of the main contributions of the governance model, with emphasis on the distribution of power among the different sociopolitical agents, especially the State and the government; and 3) a brief review of the complex and interactive nature of the sustainability paradigm and its implications for the role of the State in development processes. The principal conclusions of this paper point to the integration of a broad research agenda that places at the center of the political and academic debate, the need for a profound reform of the State, with emphasis on the aspects related to the institutional mechanisms of cooperation and interaction of the State with other central actors in development policies, as well as the reconfiguration of supranational institutions in the region, as a basis for the integration and implementation of sustainable human development agenda policies for the 21st century.

J	Medeiros, E; van der Zwet, A				Medeiros, Eduardo; van der Zwet, Arno			Sustainable and Integrated Urban Planning and Governance in Metropolitan and Medium-Sized Cities	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						integrated strategies for sustainable urban development; urban planning; sustainable development; urban governance; participatory approaches		This paper examines the design and implementation process of Integrated Strategies for Sustainable Urban Development (ISUD), as well as their main effects and lessons learned in two European cities: Barcelona in Spain, a vibrant European metropolis, and evora in Portugal, a medium-sized city with a world heritage historic centre. The former is facing socioeconomic challenges in some of its neighbourhoods, while the latter, a regional capital of an already depopulated region, Alentejo, is facing further depopulation and socioeconomic challenges. Following from a qualitative analysis of ISUD and other urban plans implemented in past decades, the article employs a framework with five analytical dimensions, based on the policy cycle (priority setting, participatory approaches, implementation strategy, collaboration networks, and measuring results and impact). These provide a framework to identify best practices. The findings demonstrate that ISUD in both cities provides impetus for sustainable strategic planning, but can be strengthened in particular via the active involvement of citizens and stakeholders in the elaboration and implementation of these ISUD. Conversely, the results demonstrate mounting challenges that many urban planners in medium-sized towns face in relation to inverting depopulation trends, raising further questions of to what extent European Cohesion policy, and ISUD in particular, can contribute to territorial cohesion objectives whilst also aiming to achieve other policy goals.

J	Subramaniam, V				Subramaniam, V			Quality governance for sustainable development: India's obligation to set a model	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES			English	Article								Sustainable development and quality governance sound deceptively simple concepts. Any worthwhile development has to be sustained and sustainable over the long term. The major support for such sustenance in any modern organized society comes from the process of governing. This support may range from one extreme of state ownership and control of production and all socioeconomic activity to the other end of merely providing legal regulation and material infrastructure. Research into this relationship can either take the empirical route comparing two or more actual systems of relations or a theoretical stance to work out the result of different sets of relations. This article does not take either of these academic routes for the obvious reason that the current provocation to define and explore this relation is the specific result of a series of identifiable developments in the last 50 years.

This introduction explains how the papers in this collection provide critical assessments of the theory and practice of tourism governance and sustainability. It argues that theoretical frameworks are crucial to research on the subject as they affect the issues examined and the policy recommendations made. Several papers in the collection focus on relevant theoretical frameworks and concepts, while others consider governance at different geographical scales and the interconnections between those scales. The temporal dimensions of governance are also explored because sustainable development relates to long time horizons. Governance is also considered in relation to trade-offs, policy failures, learning processes, adaptive management, the public sphere and the principle of subsidiarity.

J	Johnson, A				Johnson, Adrienne			The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and transnational hybrid governance in Ecuador's palm oil industry	WORLD DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Palm oil; RSPO; Latin America; Ecuador; Environmental governance; Transnational hybrid governance	MULTI-STAKEHOLDER GOVERNANCE; STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL MSC; NATIONAL INTERPRETATION; CERTIFICATION; STANDARDS; SOVEREIGNTY; INDONESIA; RESPONSES; POLITICS; IMPACTS	The expansion of Latin America's palm oil frontier has spurred an explosion of interest in the social and environmental impacts of palm oil production. Researchers have been particularly focused on the effec-tiveness of global sustainability certification standards in addressing induced vulnerabilities. Only a small fraction of this research, however, analyzes how the local institutionalization of global standards has shaped national and sub-national structures of environmental governance, or regional conceptualizations of authority. It also fails to examine how the entrenchment of global standards has reworked local social relations inhering within formal and informal palm oil governing arrangements. To address these gaps, this paper draws on the case of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) in Ecuador to answer the following research questions: 1) How does the local introduction and institutionalization of RSPO standards (re)shape national and sub-national environmental governance structures and relations? 2) How do RSPO standards reconfigure long-standing notions of power and authority? Drawing on extended fieldwork, the paper finds that the introduction of RSPO standards has prompted three major shifts in domestic palm oil governance. These shifts are: 1) technicalization of community-company relations, 2) hybridization of governance coalitions 3) regionalization of governance efforts. Taken together, these transformations point to an emerging transnational hybrid governance regime that blends public laws with private guidelines to reach national and international sustainability objectives. The regime has enabled the emergence of new palm governance authorities in the sector yet at the same time, it has rein-scribed the uneven power relations of palm oil governance. The study concludes that future research and policy efforts must go beyond simply evaluating RSPO standards in local spaces, and instead aim to improve the social relations that exist within agro-commodity chains in order to make the governance of sustainable palm oil more socially-inclusive and just.

J	Tavornmas, A; Cheeppensook, K				Tavornmas, Ajaree; Cheeppensook, Kasira			Shaping ocean governance: a study of EU normative power on Thailand's sustainable fisheries	INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS AND ECONOMIC POLICY			English	Article						Ocean governance; European Union (EU); Normative power; EU illegal; Unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU) regulation; Sustainability; Sustainable fisheries; Thailand		The European Union (EU) has been championing an agenda for better ocean governance based on a cross-sectoral, rules-based international approach and indicated its role as a strong global actor in this field. The EU, as reflected through its strategies adopted during the last decade (2005-2015), aims to shape international ocean governance on the basis of its experience in developing a sustainable and ethical approach to ocean management, notably through its environment policy and regulatory regime. This paper observes a significant transition of the EU internal policy towards a more externally-oriented one as well as its ambition in exporting the EU norms to third countries. It seems that the EU aims to lead this maritime and fisheries domain as a global actor, diffusing norms via interstate relations. The case study of EU policy towards Thailand fisheries policy, resulting in Thailand's adopting sustainable fisheries policy in 2015 will be explored in this research paper. In addition, the paper aims to analyse the development and evolution of Thailand's sustainable fisheries policy during 2015-2019 and to examine the rationales behind Thailand's shift towards more environmentally and socially friendly fisheries policy. It focuses on how and in what ways Thailand as a third country has been influenced by the EU normative power in the maritime and fisheries domain and in particular, by the EU's illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU) or "IUU Regulation" entered into force since 2010 as one of its main tools to promote ocean governance.

NRM is understood as the application of scientific ecological knowledge to resource management. By including a consideration of the normative imperatives that arise from scientific ecological knowledge and submitting them to public scrutiny, 'sustainable management of natural resources' can be recontextualised as 'sustainable governance of natural resources'. This in turn makes it possible to place the politically neutralising discourse of 'management' in a space for wider societal debate, in which the different actors involved can deliberate and negotiate the norms, rules and power relations related to natural resource use and sustainable development. The transformation of sustainable management into sustainable governance of natural resources can be conceptualised as a social learning process involving scientists, experts, politicians and local actors, and their corresponding scientific and non-scientific knowledges. The social learning process is the result of what Habermas has described as 'communicative action', in contrast to 'strategic action'. Sustainable governance of natural resources thus requires a new space for communicative action aiming at shared, intersubjectively validated definitions of actual situations and the goals and means required for transforming current norms, rules and power relations in order to achieve sustainable development. Case studies from rural India, Bolivia and Mali explore the potentials and limitations for broadening communicative action through an intensification of social learning processes at the interface of local and external knowledge. Key factors that enable or hinder the transformation of sustainable management into sustainable governance of natural resources through social learning processes and communicative action are discussed.

J	Lange, P; Bornemann, B; Burger, P				Lange, Philipp; Bornemann, Basil; Burger, Paul			Sustainability impacts of governance modes: insights from Swiss energy policy	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY & PLANNING			English	Article						Sustainability governance; governance modes; new modes of governance; sustainable development; Swiss energy policy		Governance is commonly regarded as pivotal for promoting sustainable development. However, there is a lively debate on the merits of different modes of governance in this respect, especially on the relevance of new, non-hierarchical modes. Adding to this debate, this paper explores the sustainability impacts of the range of governance modes from a comparative perspective. It investigates the relation between modes and induced societal changes and elucidates the role of the mode for promoting sustainability. Guided by a theoretical framework for both the conceptualization of governance modes and their sustainability impacts, five governance arrangements in Swiss energy policy are examined, representing different modes (from hierarchically centralized and decentralized governance to public-private and interactive modes to self-governance). The results do not support the claim that new modes are generally superior to traditional hierarchical ones in terms of promoting sustainability. Rather, the potential of new modes can best be realized in combination with hierarchical governance. Other factors such as the embedding context or the attributes of involved actors are also important for the transformative potential of governance. In view of the findings, future sustainability governance research should increasingly focus on the contextual interplay of governance modes and their meta-governing.

In Africa, progress is understood differently; human relations - including ancestors and future generations tied to the land - take precedence over development. The African concept of well-being is Ubuntu (I am a person through other persons), implemented in South Africa though truth and reconciliation, Ubuntu diplomacy, jurisprudence and People First (Batho Pele) policies. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are multilaterally negotiated and claim universality but are underpinned by European modernism (individuality, growth, separation of nature and humans, etc.). To be truly inclusive of Africa, they can do more justice to Ubuntu. However, official African positions on the SDGs emphasised industry and infrastructure, and overlooked restorative justice. Ubuntu prioritises the first five social goals, equality (SDG10), inclusivity (SDG16) and partnership (SDG17). Ubuntu would change the leading SDG theme into: 'life is mutual aid' (horizontal Ubuntu relationship) rather than the hierarchical 'leave no-one behind' (developed versus developing countries). Ubuntu would replace sustainability with the 'community of life' and individuality with 'collective agency'; and knowing through measuring with 'knowing through feeling engagement with others'. It prioritises process (strategies/now) over goals (abstract future).

J	Scheller, D; Thorn, H				Scheller, David; Thorn, Hakan			Governing "Sustainable Urban Development' Through Self-Build Groups and Co-Housing: The Cases of Hamburg and Gothenburg	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN AND REGIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						sustainable urban development; urban governance; cohousing; gentrification; governmentality; urban social movements; self-build groups; Hamburg; Germany; Gothenburg; Sweden	GOVERNANCE; LESSONS	This article critically examines the governing of sustainable urban development' through self-build cohousing groups in Gothenburg and Hamburg. The two case cities have been selected because both are currently involved in major urban restructuring, and have launched programmes to support self-build groups and cohousing as part of their emphasis on promoting urban sustainable development through this process. Departing from a theoretical discussion on advanced liberal urban governance, focusing in particular on the contemporary discourse on sustainable urban development, we examine the interaction between political institutions, civil society and private actors in the construction of cohousing as a perceived novel and alternative form of housing that may contribute to fulfilling certain sustainability goals. Questions centre on the socio-political contextualization of cohousing; concepts of sustainability; strategies of, and relations between, different actors in promoting cohousing; gentrification and segregation; and inclusion and exclusion. In conclusion we argue that, while self-build groups can provide pockets of cohousing as an alternative to dominant forms of housing, the economic and political logics of advanced liberal urban development make even such a modest target difficult, particularly when it comes to making such housing affordable.

Introduction to the special issue INTRODUCTION	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY & PLANNING			English	Editorial Material						Sustainability; environmental governance; transition; institutions; reflexivity; policy learning; participation	TRANSITION MANAGEMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL STATE; INSTITUTIONALISM; CAPACITY; LIMITS; IDEAS; POWER	Elaborated in publications on transition management, sustainability governance and deliberative environmental governance, 'reflexive governance' addresses concerns about social-ecological vulnerabilities, flawed conceptualisations of human-nature relations fragmented governance regimes and conditions for a sustainability transition. Key barriers to reflexive government include unavoidable politics; the influence of broader discursive systems that shape actors' strategic interests; and structural and deliberate limitations to the range of admitted epistemological understandings, normative perspectives and material practices. Against this background, the contributions to the special issue provide novel conceptual linkages between reflexive governance and boundary objects, intercultural dialogue, conflict management heuristics, discourse linguistics, theories of the policy cycle and reflexive law, network and learning theories, and Lasswell's 'developmental constructs'. Based on the contributions, we identify five inherent conceptual tensions of reflexive governance: between the openness of horizontal learning processes and the desired direction towards sustainable development; between reflexive governance as a normative or procedural concept; between expected learning orientations and other, strategic orientations; between governance as a precondition for reflexivity and reflexive learning as a precondition for reorganized governance structures; and between reflexivity as an open-ended, evolutionary process and the need to strategically defend the space for reflexivity against powerful groups with an interest in the status quo.

J	YE, C; PAN, JW; LIU, ZM				YE, Chao; PAN, Jiawei; LIU, Zhimin			The historical logics and geographical patterns of rural-urban governance in China	JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						rural-urban relation; urbanization; sustainable development; mobility; regional disparities	REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA; LAND-USE; SPACE; EMPOWERMENT; RETHINKING; SCALE; STATE; CITY	The advent of a mobile society has led to profound changes in China's traditional rural-urban pattern and called for new strategies for urban and rural governance. Based on a macro perspective of temporal and spatial evolution, this study analyzes the historical logics of rural-urban governance, explores the geographical patterns of challenges in China's rural-urban governance, and finally puts forward targeted strategies for rural-urban governance toward integrated and sustainable development in China. From the historical perspective, the urban originates from the rural, and the connotation of rural, that is, a regional-scale outlook, rural-urban relations, and sociocultural interaction, forms the traditional approach to rural-urban governance. China's rural-urban governance has evolved from antagonism toward integration. In terms of theoretical development, the turn toward mobility is an important driving factor shaping and promoting the transformation of research focus on rural-urban governance. The mobility of urban and rural factors has especially in recent decades brought extensive challenges for governance, which are highlighted by the disintegration of the stability of rural and urban structures, growing regional disparities in rural education levels, and serious aging and hollowing crises in rural areas. We therefore propose that rural-urban governance should give sufficient consideration to the convergence of wider interests; realize social potential through institutional, cultural and spatial restructuring; and attach importance to collaborative development and governance. And the transfer of rural problems to urban areas should be paid attention to by rural-urban governance. This research enriches the knowledge regarding the logics and patterns of China's rural-urban governance from an interdisciplinary perspective. It is also helpful in the promotion of rural-urban integration and sustainable development, especially at a time when the mobility of social factors between rural areas and urban areas increasingly challenges traditional urban and rural governance and drives its evolution.

To this end, the paper is organized into two main sections. The first section provides a literature analysis of theoretical frameworks as they pertain to the role of political bodies, the policies, and their impacts on local communities in relation to the governance of smart cities. The second section explores the ongoing implementation of "smart city" projects in Italy, in order to understand how cities address their development perspectives from a conceptual framework to the construction of an actual urban space, faced with divergent politics, messy social systems, and different scales of urban governance. In this framework, disparities between urban governance scales and ideologies encompassing smart cities seem linked to the relational systems that local administrations can develop between neighboring cities. The final section summarizes the authors' conclusions, giving particular attention to how networked urban systems are programmed, because they have been found to be key to strategic and transformative planning.

That this relationship can remain strategically stable and embrace further positive development is not only in the interests of themselves, but also of the whole international community. In other words, the relationship has gone far beyond the bilateral level to have increasingly significant implications for the Asia-Pacific region and the world at large. Currently, China and the U.S. are actively engaging each other in framing anewregional order in the Asia-Pacific, dealing with a series of global governance as well as geostrategic issues. During this process, some new challenges in their bilateral relationship are outstanding, including their ever more intense competition for a new world order, difficulty for their deepening cooperation on the new strategic basis of global governance, and their deficient security cooperation in the global arena. Facing these new challenges, both countries need to strive to manage their relationship more prudently and flexibly in order to keep it on the right track.

Hydrosocial rupture: causes and consequences for transboundary governance	ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY			English	Article						hydrosocial relations; rupture; Southeast Asia; transboundary water governance	WATER; INDONESIA; SCIENCE; CYCLE	Unsustainable models of growth-based development are pushing aquatic ecologies outside known historical ranges and destabilizing human activities that have long depended on them. We develop the concept of hydrosocial rupture to explore how humanwater resource connections change when they are exposed to cumulative development pressures. The research analyzes stakeholder perceptions of hydrosocial ruptures in two sites in Southeast Asia: (1) peatlands in Riau Province, Indonesia, and (2) Tonle Sap Lake, Cambodia. In both contexts, capital-driven processes have reconfigured human-water resource connections to generate transgressive social and environmental consequence that cannot be contained within administrative units or property boundaries. Our findings show how these ruptured hydrosocial relations are perceived and acted upon by the most proximate users of water resources. In Cambodia, a policy of resettlement has sought to thin hydrosocial relations in response to biodiversity loss, chronic pollution, and changing hydrology in Tonle Sap Lake. By contrast, in Indonesia's Riau Province, efforts are underway to thicken human-water relations by hydrologically rehabilitating peatlands drained for agricultural development. We argue that in both of these contexts hydrosocial ruptures should be understood as phenomena of transboundary governance that cannot be addressed by individual groups of users, sectors, or jurisdictions.

On the way to this development Poland if far behind the other countries, especially Norway, which seems to be an unquestionable leader in this respect in Europe. There is a distance between Norway and Poland in all ten dimensions (themes) described in the EU Sustainable Development Strategy (socio-economic development, sustainable consumption and production, social inclusion, demographic changes, public health, climate change and energy, sustainable transport, natural resources, global partnership and good governance). Unfortunately it is not likely that the distance could be significantly reduced in the coming years. Poland must accept that fact and simultaneously learn from the leader and take advantage of its experience, but can also benefit from financial support, which is possible to obtain from the EEA and Norway Grants the funds provided to particular programs aimed at reducing economic and social disparities and strengthening bilateral relations between Norway and Poland.

J	Haikio, L				Haikio, Liisa			From Innovation to Convention: Legitimate Citizen Participation in Local Governance	LOCAL GOVERNMENT STUDIES			English	Article						citizen participation; local governance; New Public Management; sustainable development; legitimacy	PUBLIC MANAGEMENT; URBAN GOVERNANCE; POLICY-MAKING; REPRESENTATION; DISCOURSE; DEMOCRACY	In governance structure legitimacy is required not only of the governing system, local authorities or public organisations but also of other participants, including citizens. The legitimacy cannot be judged either by traditions of representative democracy or by innovative theories of deliberative or participatory democracy. The article analyses scientific publications on citizen participation in local governance. It asks how empirical studies on local sustainable development planning (SDP) and New Public Management (NPM) practices construct legitimate citizen participation. In general, studies on citizen participation have not conceptualised the relations between citizens and power holders as questions of legitimacy. However, the studies approaching citizen participation in the local processes of SDP and NPM include various empirical, theoretical and normative arguments for citizen participation. These arguments recognise, accept and support particular activities, arguments and outcomes of citizen participation, and include and exclude agents and issues. They construct and reflect the definition of legitimacy in the local governance. As constructed by scientific texts, justifications for citizen participation reproduce a discursive structure in which citizen participation becomes marginalised and citizens' views excluded. The results illustrate that discursive structures of legitimate citizen participation support conventional governing practices and hinder innovative practices in local governance.

We analyse interactions between the changing governance context, the course of the multi-actor governance process, and the choices in relation to governance framework characteristics and content for four successive stages of governance framework development. This provides the basis for reflection on the competences required for effective multi-actor sustainability governance, and a discussion about the, role of the nation-state in sustainability governance of global economies such as biofuels. The governance framework for sustainable biofuels has contributed to a more transparent and secure investment climate for biofuels in Mozambique. Key factors for success were (1) the presence of different types of competences during the various stages of the governance framework development, (2) closing the gap between 'licences to sell' and 'licences to produce' across different governance levels, and (3) balancing between the short- and long-term objectives for biofuel production in Mozambique and requirements of global biofuel markets. Developing-country nation-states can provide an essential contribution to these success-factors for global governance of sustainable biofuels. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Thus, fund managers and investors see a need to align profits with environmental, social and economic variables in business management as well as corporate governance. The Brazilian Corporate Sustainability Index (indice de Sustentabilidade Empresarial-ISE) was created in 2005 by the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, currently known as B3, which is the result of the merger between the BM&FBovespa and CETIP, and has this nomenclature in reference to the initial letters ofBrasil, Bolsa, Balcao. The ISE aims to identify a company's commitment to sustainability and thereby guide the capital and credit market, highlighting companies that incorporate social and environmental risks into the organization, seeking to positively influence the image of the companies involved. The aim of this research was to verify the superior economic and financial performance of the Brazilian companies that are included in the ISE portfolio in relation to the other companies that constitute the Ibovespa, between the years of 2014 and 2018. As a result, a neutral relationship between financial performance and sustainable development was identified, which is consistent with the results of previous studies referenced and addressed in this research. The findings of this study provide an important contribution to the existing research on sustainability in financial markets, since few scientific articles that investigate, using indicators and statistical treatment, the Brazilian sustainability market, are available.

Today definitions of development and sustainability often go together analysing global, as well as regional and local processes. Indeed, in this case the definition of competitiveness, as well as the definition of development sustainability requires adequate interpretation and quantitative assessment. In the paper country (region) competitiveness is assumed as three-dimensional indicator, which depends on the fields of activity, dominating in the country, international relations and legal, financial, ecological, natural resources and geographical location environment competitiveness. The competitiveness of the parts composing the general competitiveness is measured quantitatively. Index dependence on means and resources for their training is also assessed.

To achieve these goals, interdisciplinary and collaborative efforts are needed. Frugal innovation emerges as a paradigm challenging traditional innovation pathways which may have the potential to bring together different stakeholders' efforts to achieve sustainable development goals. This systematic literature review analyzes current research linking the concepts of frugal innovation and sustainable development. The aim is to highlight approaches and conditions in which frugal innovations can drive sustainable development, especially in relation to different types of private sector actors. Based on the content analysis of current studies, we formulate shortcomings of existing research and develop a research agenda with the aim to bring the two research streams closer.

Consequently, this study investigates the effect of effective e-governance practices and decentralization on public administration in the Erbil district of Iraq. The purpose of this study is to determine the role of decentralization as a mediator between good e-governance practices and public administration in relation to the sustainable local development of the Erbil city. The sample of 409 employees of the Erbil municipality who participated in the survey was analyzed using Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) with the assistance of WarPLS 7.0. The results of the study revealed a significant correlation between e-governance practices and decentralization and public administration. In addition, it was discovered that decentralization has a significant effect on public administration. The finding of a significant negative relationship between e-governance and decentralization suggests that e-governance has a negative impact on decentralization in Erbil. The implications of the study are discussed, and the study suggests that devolving power and authority to subunits in Iraq would enhance public administration and promote sustainable local development.

J	Neto, S				Neto, Susana			Water governance in an urban age	UTILITIES POLICY			English	Article						Territorial water governance; Sustainable urban development; Integrated urban water policy (IUWP)		This paper addresses the challenges of constructing alternatives to the current water policy practices, regarding the social and cultural context of an increasing urbanized world. It aims at providing a reflective exercise based upon the analysis of a set of illustrative examples from different regions of the world. By presenting examples of critical problems or innovative approaches, several conclusions are drawn, which intend to clarify the most effective ways to influence water governance and urban policies at the local level. The cases presented are used to propose a referential and illustrative framework of possible ways to progress towards urban sustainability and 'good' water governance. The ultimate objective of this discussion is to promote and support the re-thinking of 'traditional' planning conceptual models (top-down and regulatory oriented), and their inadequacy to face the real social challenges existing today in urban areas, through an appropriate governance framework. Considering the goal of policy integration in the ongoing processes of change, this article proposes a set of recommendations in relation to urban development and water governance. Finally, this discussion builds on existing concepts like 'sustainable urban water management and 'integrated urban water management' to propose a new and more policy oriented conceptual framework: integrated urban water policy (IMP).

However, natural constraints, climate change and the increase of population forecasts will challenge this goal and how it interacts with others. In particular, domestic water will compete with additional water demands essential for the achievement of other goals (i.e. SGD2 on zero huger or SDG14 life below water). We assess how future domestic water demand in cities will interact with other SDGs. First, we use an evaluation framework to identify positive and negative relations. We then calculate the required water to meet this demand and compare it with the performance of other water-dependent goals. Our results show that larger increases in domestic water demand will happen in countries underperforming in other water-dependent goals. How urban areas deal with water resources will shape these relations. Crucially, urban water decisions will determine the sustainability of global water resources and, ultimately, the performance of all SDGs.

These 17 goals and 169 targets set out an agenda for sustainable development for all nations that embraces economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental protection. Now, the agenda moves from agreeing the goals to implementing and ultimately achieving them. Across the goals, 42 targets focus on means of implementation, and the final goal, Goal 17, is entirely devoted to means of implementation. However, these implementation targets are largely silent about interlinkages and interdependencies among goals. This leaves open the possibility of perverse outcomes and unrealised synergies. We demonstrate that there must be greater attention on interlinkages in three areas: across sectors (e.g., finance, agriculture, energy, and transport), across societal actors (local authorities, government agencies, private sector, and civil society), and between and among low, medium and high income countries. Drawing on a global sustainability science and practice perspective, we provide seven recommendations to improve these interlinkages at both global and national levels, in relation to the UN's categories of means of implementation: finance, technology, capacity building, trade, policy coherence, partnerships, and, finally, data, monitoring and accountability.

Sustainability, 10(8), 2741-2726. https://doi.org/10.3390/su10082741). According to the Bruntland Commission, Sustainable Development is defined as a development that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability for future generations to meet their needs (WCED. [1987]. Our common future: The Brundtland report. Oxford University Press). In this conceptual study, we outline a simplistic framework of aspects, variables, and relations constituting a workable definition of 'sustainable success' inspired by previous theoretical models. The aim is to contribute to a pragmatic clarification of how the concept of sustainable development could be more understandable, measurable, and manageable during global uncertainty and rapid change. A theoretical background is presented, followed by an overview of the method of investigation with a subsequent presentation of the results and a reasoning that frames the conceptual framework on critical constructs for measuring sustainable success based on stakeholder perceptions.

J	Redclift, MR				Redclift, Michael R.			Sustainable Development (1987-2005) - an Oxymoron Comes of Age	Problemy Ekorozwoju			English	Article						sustainable development; modernity; global environmental change		In the wake of the Brundtland report (1987) it was argued that 'development' ought to be able to accommodate 'sustainability'. The discussion of 'development' needed to be enlarged and a 'long view' taken of society/nature relations. During the last two decades this formulation has increasingly been called into question: critics of 'sustainable development' have argued that it is an oxymoron, and that development cannot accommodate sustainability, and there has been criticism from the skeptical Right and the Deep Green Left. Others have argued that both the scientific evidence of global environmental change and increasing globalization (both economic and cultural) suggest that it is possible to "re-tune" development along lines that are less energy and material intensive. However, the political and social implications of employing the idea of 'sustainability' have rarely been thought through. There has little attention to the implications of re-thinking sustainability for governance, security or ideas of justice. During the 1970s and 1980s environmental policy and regulation identified external risks (wildlife, effluents etc) which could be contained and repaired. The risks were seen as controllable. There was strong modernist impulse at work in delineating human responsibilities for nature. Since 1992, however, this confident, regulatory modernist impulse has been undermined. Floods, storms, habitat loss and droughts can be seen as immanent to the system (especially the climate system). They are internal risky. These doubts about control extend to new areas, notably the new genetics.

J	Mert, A				Mert, Aysem			Partnerships and the Privatisation of Environmental Governance: On Myths, Forces of Nature and Other Inevitabilities	ENVIRONMENTAL VALUES			English	Article						Global environmental governance; partnerships for sustainable development; globalisation; international relations; corporations; discourses of privatisation; UNEP		Since the end of the Cold War, two parallel developments took place in global governance: fragmentation in social/environmental legislations across countries, and an increasing uniformity (or 'globalisation') of economic/financial legislations. In the liberal democratic context of global governance, both of these developments are embodied in partnerships for sustainable development. Studying these partnerships in the context of private environmental governance and tracing the origin of the concept in business and law, can reveal the implications of 'privatisation of governance' on sovereignty, authority, and global governance. Focusing on partnerships in the United Nations context, this paper examines the private environmental governance institutions in their historical economic context.

To mitigate these problems and contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), various policy interventions have been initiated, mostly in the form of partnership arrangements. This article examines two such partnerships, the Amboseli Ecosystem Trust (AET) and the Big Life Foundation (BLF), to understand how they contribute to the governance of the Amboseli landscape, and the intrinsic link to power and politics. The research findings, based on document analysis, interviews and focus-group discussions, reveal that the partnerships have performed complementing landscape governance roles. Whereas AET focused on policy development, agenda-setting and meta-governance, BLF concentrated on policy implementation and meta-governance in relation to wildlife security. The way the partnerships performed these governance roles can be explained through the four faces of power, which reveal BLF's compulsory power and AET's institutional power. Nevertheless, the partnerships have only partially managed to bridge conflicting conservation and development discourses illustrating that the concept of sustainable development appears to hold little productive power on the ground. Overall, the article provides important insights into the contributions that partnerships can make to the SDGs, but also their limitations.

This chapter highlights several cases of complex crises where cascading events affect international stability. Climate change is considered as a risk multiplier which disturbs the balance between natural and social systems and amplifies the consequences through complex impact chains that affect the functioning of critical infrastructures and supply networks; intensify the nexus of water, energy and food; lead to production losses, price increases and financial crises in other regions through global markets; undermine human security, social living conditions and political stability; and trigger or aggravate migration movements and conflict situations. An integrative framework of human-environment interaction is used to analyse destabilizing developments, tipping elements and cascading risks, as well as concepts of resilience, viability and sustainable peace. Whether climate stress fuels a cycle of violence or climate policy drives a transition towards a cycle of cooperation and sustainable peace depends on the human and societal responses. Strategies for viability transformations and adaptive governance range from climate mitigation and adaptation and the building of social networks to new capabilities of disaster management, crisis prevention and conflict resolution. Several examples are presented showing how transition and transformation processes can be analysed with an agent-based model framework.

Its original environmental bias has transformed into a multidimensional conception including social and economic change with strong influences on the political realm. Experience shows that many Local Agenda 21 processes do not obtain the expected outcomes due to many external and internal factors that make human sustainable development difficult to materialise at the local level. This paper deals with the issue of identifying the endogenous and exogenous variables that determine the development of Local Agenda 21 processes and set the differences among contexts. The emphasis is placed on methodological approaches to Local Agenda 21 planning and management of the process from a governance perspective. These factors can be appropriated for describing the different elements of Local Agenda 21 activities and their relation to long-term development in a city. Planning and management approaches underpinning Local Agenda 21 can thus be assessed in relation to their contribution to human sustainable development.

As the Brundtland Commission highlights, the improvement of present conditions should not compromise future generations' needs. So far, (social) sustainable development has mostly focused on the amelioration of contemporary people's wellbeing, relegating its duties towards future generations to second place. Given this, I consider it necessary to (re-)direct social innovation towards the promotion of the wellbeing of future people. I propose the concept of irreplaceable goods, a notion deriving from a strong sustainability perspective, which could then be integrated into social innovation practices related to sustainable development. Focusing on guaranteeing, at least, sufficient fruition of certain goods and resources, I devise this concept as a governance tool for steering development actions towards intergenerational justice, driven by social innovation action. In this article, we firstly delineate the relations between sustainable development and social innovation, while focusing on 'value-driven' social innovation. Afterward, I shortly introduce strong sustainability as support for future generations' wellbeing. Furthermore, I develop the concept of irreplaceable goods as a governance tool in social innovation practices and finalize with a discussion on the application of irreplaceable goods in the assessment of sustainable development strategies.

Exploring sustainable urban water governance: a case study of institutional capacity	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						capacity assessment framework; institutional capacity; Sydney; Australia; sustainable urban water management	IMPLEMENTATION; MANAGEMENT; DRAINAGE	The sustainable urban water management system is likely to be characterised by complex and flexible governance arrangements, increased inter-organisational interaction and wide stakeholder participation, which contrasts significantly with the traditional approach. Recently there has been significant financial investment in urban water reform, however the reforms have not been as successful as anticipated and numerous institutional barriers remain. Understanding and assessing institutional capacity is central to addressing institutional impediments. Institutional capacity comprises individual, intra- and inter-organisational and external rules and incentives capacities. This paper reports on the first case study of a social research project that aims to develop an institutional capacity assessment framework. Empirical data from semi-structured interviews with 59 water industry experts in Sydney, Australia, and a broad literature survey were used. The key capacity attributes identified could form the basis of an institutional capacity assessment tool and reveal common and differing attributes across stakeholder groups which provide insight into stakeholder relations. Synthesis of the results revealed that intra- and inter-organisational capacities were facing particular challenges and should be explicitly addressed in reform, policy and capacity development initiatives.

Its contribution is a critical conceptualization of how collaborative tourism design can facilitate sustainable transformation. Recognizing SDG #17 to "Revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development" we argue that collaboration - not only partnerships and cooperation - should be a central tenet for intentional change. Collaboration rests on the hypothesis that the sum is more than its individual parts. We introduce how the collaborative design (co-design) of tourism contributes a unique range of processes, methods, tools and notably an attitude of mind that enables its practitioners to, with others, explore, reveal, encompass and address issues and nuances in an overall sustainable tourism co-design process. This understanding deliberately challenges the notion that a sustainable development process can be planned and micro-managed with pre-determined outcomes. Examples from Denmark and Norway illustrate how sustainable tourism co-design intentionally aims to transform human relations, encourage stewardship and demonstrate how such a practice does not reach for quick-fix solutions. Findings indicate that we have yet to realize the power of collaboration, stewardship and "other-regarding" ethics to guide actions underpinning SDG#17 for more sustainable and resourceful futures.

The implications of this insight's for sustainable development remains underexplored. Even thought environmental protection and health promotion are clearly interconnected at the impact level, it remains unclear how global environmental governance interacts with global health governance at the institutional level. In order to fill this gap, this article aims to assess how environmental treaties contribute to global health governance. Methods and results: To assess how environmental treaties contribute to global health governance, we conducted a content analysis of 2280 international environmental treaties. For each of these treaties, we measure the type and number of health-related provisions in these treaties. The result is the Health and Environment Interplay Database (HEIDI), which we make public with the publication of this article. This new database reveals that more than 300 environmental treaties have health-related provisions. Conclusions: We conclude that the global environmental regime contributes significantly to the institutionalization of the global health regime, considering that the health regime includes itself very few treaties focusing primarily on health. When reflecting on how global governance can improve population health, decision makers should not only consider the instruments available to them within the realm of global health institutions. They should broaden their perspectives to integrate the contribution of other global regimes, such as the global environmental regime.

Hence, the United Nations Conference for Trade and Development (UNCTAD) developed the Investment Policy Framework for Sustainable Development (IPFSD) as guidance for countries to achieve sustainable development from FDI. Using the IPFSD, this paper examines the investment policies of Indonesia under centralized and various decentralization periods and describes the relationships among government levels in implementing the policies which guide FDI. From the examination, we found that the investment policies in Indonesia have been directed to achieve sustainable development gradually. Furthermore, the intergovernmental relationships that have changed due to the decentralization process have become crucial to the effectiveness of investment policies for the society. During the centralized period, the performance of inward FDI was good, but citizen input and participation in the policy process was weak. In the first wave of decentralization, local governments gained significant powers from the central government to guide FDI. However, the great devolution of power to local governments without clear mechanisms of intergovernmental relations and accountability led to a deterioration of the investment climate and made the policies less effective. Finally, during the second wave of decentralization, the central government has taken responsibility in the FDI management process but still provides more room for local governments to participate in the development process. Hence, cooperation between national and local government is more enhanced during this period to guide FDI.

Contextually, the paper points out the role of HEIs in training specialists, the universities being the crucible in which future socio-political leaders of society are formed and developed. Within the current security environment, maintaining stability and peace is the task of political elites that must have real competencies to ensure good governance and democracy. A bad governance and lack of social responsibility represent, inevitably, security threats that can potentially destabilize society. Their prevention and elimination implies a quality training of government representatives and decision makers within HEIs.

This chapter will reflect on the place-based rationale of the approach and consider the major innovations in the 2014-2020 regulations. It will subsequently consider how Member States have designed and implemented the regulation, particularly focusing on variation between and within member states. The second section of the chapter considers the added value of the provisions at the European level. Added value can be captured in three dimensions: the extent to which new or strengthened strategic frameworks have emerged, the extent to which integrated governance and strengthened implementation capacities have been achieved and the extent to which experimentation and innovation in relation to interventions have taken place. The third part of the chapter will analyse some of the key challenges in relation to implementation of these strategies through European funding streams. These relate to issues around capacity, regulations and governance. The final section will reflect on the lessons that can be learned in relation to the role of integrated place-based strategies to achieve territorial cohesion.

J	Scheba, A				Scheba, Andreas			Conservation agriculture and sustainable development in Africa: insights from Tanzania	NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM			English	Article						Conservation agriculture; REDD; Tanzania; sustainable development	FARMER FIELD SCHOOLS; REDD PLUS; CARBON SEQUESTRATION; INNOVATION PROCESSES; FOREST MANAGEMENT; EAST-AFRICA; SOIL CARBON; KNOWLEDGE; ADOPTION; SYSTEMS	In recent years, conservation agriculture (CA) has been increasingly promoted as the best solution to sustainable agricultural development in Africa. Proponents argue that it offers increased yields, reduced labour requirements, improved soil fertility and climate mitigation benefits. At the same time, a growing number of scholars have questioned its promises, impacts and applicability to small, resource-poor African farmers. To add to the debate, this paper draws on fieldwork from two case study villages in the Lindi region of Tanzania. It scrutinizes CA farmer field schools' performances, the impact on villagers' perceptions of core principles and socio-economic/institutional constraints related to its adoption. It demonstrates how farmer field schools failed to meet initial expectations because of challenges associated with economic benefits, labour demand, availability and accessibility of inputs, infrastructure, governance, and stakeholder relations. It argues that the applicability to and adoption of CA depends on the transformation of individual perceptions as well as structural constraints, including credit facilities, markets for inputs, infrastructure and availability of labour, which has long been a limitation of donor-initiated programmes. Under constraining socio-economic and institutional conditions, questions continue to loom large over the long-term applicability of CA to African smallholder farmers.

At the same time, it created new opportunities for those who have a forward-looking strategy and strive to overcome "the limits to growth", in other words, to ensure a long-term blended value creation with economic and non-economic benefits. There are numerous sets of the sustainable development indicators and indices, but the weights of each particular component are different and need further clarification. Nowadays, the environmental risks in general and climate-related in particular are priced (e.g. environmental taxes) and have a strong impact on the social and economic relations by creating negative and positive externalities for our daily life. For this reason, economic agents are forced to become sustainable to the non-financial risks through switching to the new environmental and social business models. For this reason, better sustainable development indicators are crucial for an improved management of the non-financial risks and sustainable blended value creation. Hence, the aim of this paper is to examine the role of environmental risks in shaping sustainable development conditions on the macrolevel and to elaborate the ways for a better management of the nonfinancial risks (Environmental, Social and Governance - ESG). For this purpose, the impact of the most important environmental risks on the main economic and social indicators has been examined (e.g. Human Development Index and GDP per capita). Such an approach allowed us to identify the extent to which specific environmental factors influencing social and economic development can reshape the sustainable development conditions. In course of research, two sets of countries have been singled out to verify statistical significance of elaborated models. To achieve this goal, the authors have split an available dataset into two groups: EU and non-EU countries. The reason behind it is the fact that EU countries are among the leaders in the area of sustainable development and have already undertaken related environmental improvements in the last decades. Moreover, the above-mentioned countries are continuing such successful pathways today and with the new European Green Deal could go even far beyond this frontier. The results of current research suggest that existing indicators cannot fully encompass all the aspects of sustainable development and should be revised. Such findings relate both to the composition of the indicators and the weights attributed to each particular component. The application of regression analysis showed that such factors as water and air quality and biodiversity have the strongest explanatory power - 67% of the fluctuations in GDP per capita and 87% in case of HDI. The R-squared is ranging from 0.7 to 0.8 in both cases and confirms consistency of the elaborated models. To verify the results achieved, the similar models have been prepared only for the EU countries. As a result, all independent variables demonstrated the same significant impact on GDP per capita also for the EU countries. However, in this case the R-squared is only 0.27 due to the fact that ESG indicators within the EU area are rather homogenous. The impact of environmental factors on the level of HDI for the EU countries is much stronger comparing to GDP per capita. An overall explanatory power of the model for the EU countries exceeds 0.45 (R-squared). The most influential factor is the quality of water resources. Other important independent variables in the model for the EU member states are biodiversity and air quality. The authors argue that it is necessary to incorporate the above-mentioned environmental factors into the updated version of the Human Development Index as the most appropriate indicators of sustainable development. Consequently, the weights of the components should be recalculated to improve management of the non-financial risks on macrolevel, facilitating the blended value creation process.

J	Gyberg, P; Lofgren, H				Gyberg, Per; Lofgren, Hakan			Knowledge outside the box - sustainable development education in Swedish schools	EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Curriculum; multidisciplinary; sustainable development; knowledge instrumentalism; teaching		Background: Sustainable development, as an area of knowledge, appears in several different places in the curriculum and does not fit neatly within the scope of traditional subject areas. In many countries, including Sweden, it has long been upheld as an important tool for increasing understanding of, and dealing with, environmental problems. It is not clear, however, what role education can actually have in the making of a more sustainable future. Even though there are several potential ways for sustainable development to be involved in education, the concept raises many questions when transferred to the school context.Purpose: This paper investigates how teachers deal with the difficulty of defining and approaching sustainable development as an area of knowledge in Swedish schools.Sample: This article is based on semi-structured interviews with 40 teachers, 13 of whom were lower secondary school teachers (pupil age 12-15) and 27 were upper secondary school teachers (pupil age 15-18). The study involves teachers in all subjects where sustainable development is a goal in the syllabus. The study is also based on participant observation in one upper secondary class. A total of 17 different schools were involved, from a wide range of locations in Sweden.Design and methods: The paper builds on qualitative data and the analysis of transcribed interviews and group interviews with teachers in Swedish lower and upper secondary schools. Group interviews, involving three or more people, were conducted on eight occasions. The pupils at an upper secondary school were also observed while they were working on a course called policy and sustainable development'. Data were transcribed and analysed thematically.Findings: The analysis suggests that, according to the teachers' experiences, the demands of equivalence and measurability in school have increased and that this affects how sustainable development is approached in teaching and learning. Three main categories of knowledge were identified. The study also presents two representations that model how teachers may approach knowledge about sustainable development - metaphorically termed the Accountant' and the Adventurer' - and their different effects on knowledge.Conclusions: There is a tendency for complex knowledge areas such as sustainable development, which do not fit seamlessly into traditional curriculum subjects, to become oversimplified when translated into teaching situations. According to the representations that we described metaphorically, the teacher, as an accountant, is characterised by knowledge instrumentalism', which means that teachers administer knowledge and the pupils consume it. In this transactional model, the accountant is also very dependent on external governance and control. Alternatively, the teacher, as an adventurer, is characterised by authority, knowledge and self-control. In this model, knowledge sometimes grows in an unpredictable way in the meeting between people who share common experiences. For adventurers, sustainable development is a matter of commitment and awareness, and it involves an explicit stance. The metaphors can be placed on a continuum which describes how teachers manage the demands of the school system in relation to the knowledge area of sustainable development.

The inland water is very precious to every single creature. Therefore, it is vital to take extra care to all of the environmental components, which includes the inland water. A good municipal management will ensure the inland water is maintained properly as well as a good protection of the people, which are consuming the inland water. A good municipal management derives from the concept of sustainable development. Therefore, this paper examines the usage of the regulatory framework for municipal management on inland water resources in relation to the sustainable development from Malaysian legal perspectives, identify actions and cases which deal with sustainable development from Malaysian legal perspectives and lastly, discussing the regulatory framework as a means for sustainable development.

The incompatibility between energy policies and environmental policies characterizes the contemporary history of developing countries. From a theoretical framework this comparison sets up under the multilateral governance approach, in order to address how "innovation" on governance represents a key point to create new alternatives which resolve this incompatibility. From the perspective of Geels and Voss, the main hypothesis of this article is that innovation on governance allows to identify local nodes or synergies, which into a multilevel context of local-global impact, allow to articulate ambivalent interest between the governmental, private and environmental sectors. The first part of the text focus on understanding the current development of energy nationalism, taking on some particularities of Latin-American area. The second part explains the conceptual framework on innovation on governance reinforcing the relevance of local sphere. The last part presents environmental governance, besides some of the their tensions in the case of developing countries.

In September 2015, the United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development which includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 SDG targets. It made environmental sustainability a key component of the agenda, whose preamble recognises that social and economic development depends on the sustainable management of Earth's natural resources. Understanding the interlinkages between the broad and globally focused 2030 Agenda and components of the natural environment remain a practical challenge for both researchers and decision-makers in all disciplines. It is unclear how SDG targets relate to urban ecosystems and what evidence base supports these relationships. Here, we address what changes are required concerning urban ecosystem management and how management of urban ecosystems can reinforce or undermine action to deliver all 169 targets in the 2030 Agenda. We characterised 91 targets requiring action in relation to urban ecosystem management. These collectively emphasise the need to sustainably manage nature, provide equal rights to basic services, pursue sustainable economic growth, and strengthen governance and policy development at multiple scales. We identified 102 targets (99 synergies and 51 trade-offs) with published evidence of relationships with urban ecosystems, where decisions about urban ecosystems affect humanities ability to realise greater welfare and well-being, and build physical and social infrastructure. These findings highlight that sustainable management of urban ecosystems cannot be achieved without addressing other issues such as economic growth, equality or good governance. Translating these interlinkages into a strategy supported by all actors in society is important for achieving sustainable urban ecosystem management.	[Maes, Mikael J.

Governance influences agricultural and rural development (ARD) policy impacts. The paper aims at analysing ARD governance and coordination in BiH. The paper is based on primary information collected by questionnaires and semi-structured interviews performed in 2011 with representatives of 120 institutions as well as a secondary data review. Vertical coordination between State level institutions with entities, cantons, regions, municipalities and non-state actors, especially civil society ones, is still particularly challenging. Coordination between the State Ministry of Foreign Trade and External Relations; Ministries of Agriculture of the Republika Srpska (RS) and Federation of BiH (FBiH) and the Department for Agriculture of Brcko district is crucial. Participation of civil society organizations in ARD policies design and evaluation should be encouraged. Effectiveness of vertical coordination also depends on quality of horizontal coordination at RS and FBiH levels.

Freerk; Arts, Bas			The Governance of Indigenous Natural Products in Namibia: A Policy Network Analysis	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Indigenous natural products; Policy network; Non-timber forest product; Actor relations; Governance structure; Sustainable commercialization	LIVELIHOODS	At the end of the 20th century, optimism existed that non-timber forest products (NTFPs) can form an integral part in conservation and development strategies. However, there is limited knowledge on how the different stakeholders could relate to the state or to each other in promoting commercialization of NTFPs. Applying the policy network as an analytical framework, we investigated the structural patterns of actor relations in the governance structure of indigenous natural products (INPs) in Namibia, to understand the implications of such relations on INP policy process. The findings indicate that the INP policy network in Namibia is multi-dimensional, consisting of the Indigenous Plant Task Team (IPTT)-the key governance structure for resource mobilization and information sharing; and functional relations which serve specific roles in the INP value chain. The existing relations have facilitated policy development particularly for heavily regulated species, such as devil's claw; but for other species, only incremental changes are observed in terms of small-scale processing facilities for value addition and exclusive purchase agreements for sustainable sourcing of INPs. Participation of primary producers, private actors and quality standardization bodies is limited in INPs governance structures, which narrow the scope of information sharing. Consequently, despite that the IPTT has fostered publicly funded explorative pilot projects, ranging from production to marketing of INPs, there are no clear guidelines how these projects results can be transferred to private entities for possible commercialization. Further collaboration and information sharing is needed to guide public sector relations with the private entities and cooperatives.

J	Cormier, B				Cormier, Ben			Analyzing if and how international organizations contribute to the sustainable development goals: Combining power and behavior	JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR			English	Article						international organizations; international relations; organizational behavior; sustainable development goals	MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS; WORLD-BANK; FOREIGN-AID; EPISTEMIC COMMUNITIES; COALITION-FORMATION; REGIME FORMATION; EMERGING DONORS; LEADERSHIP; POLITICS; GOVERNANCE	Can International Organizations (IOs) such as the World Bank, United Nations, and International Labor Organization contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)? This article argues that this is best analyzed by simultaneously considering two sets of factors: the international political constraints external to IOs and the organizational processes and structures internal to IOs. More specifically, this article suggests that such analyses can take place by combining scholarship on International Relations (IR) and Organizational Behavior (OB). The article defines international power, outlines various constraints on IO autonomy, and suggests that OB and IR are well positioned to jointly improve the study of IO employment practices, organizational structures, bureaucratic politics, and inter-organizational effects. The core aim is to provide justification and material for combining IR and OB in further research on IOs.

J	Elander, I; Gustavsson, E				Elander, Ingemar; Gustavsson, Eva			From policy community to issue networks: Implementing social sustainability in a Swedish urban development programme	ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING C-POLITICS AND SPACE			English	Article						Policy community; issue networks; governance; government; sustainable urban development; social sustainability; Sweden	SEGREGATION; SWEDEN	In this article a "sustainable urban development" programme in Sweden (Delegation for Sustainable Cities, 2008-2012) is analysed, with a particular focus on the social dimension, and in the light of a commonly held assumption of a general shift in politics over time "from government to governance". However, on closer examination the programme comes out as something quite different. Taking "policy community" as our conceptual point of departure the article first portrays how post-war housing policy in Sweden was implemented jointly by a potent central government, strong local governments, public housing companies and major interest organisations. The Delegation for Sustainable Cities, on the other hand, was launched as "a national arena for sustainable urban development" with a multifaceted mission, including the production and dissemination of knowledge through best practice; the promotion of multi-actor dialogue and coordination; and the use and export of green technology. Implementation of the programme was delegated to a small number of projects in selected housing districts. In relation to the narrative "from government to governance", the Delegation for Sustainable Cities rather indicates the opposite, i.e. government steering by a combination of structural non-intervention, rhetorical flair and selective fragmentation into project-bound issue networks. The sustainability discourse thus turned out to be a perfect umbrella for the fragmented implementation structure of the Delegation for Sustainable Cities programme. Instead of a tight, multi-level, national governance structure (policy community) we thus have a case of governing at some distance by a combination of what in recent literature have been labelled the Regulatory State and the Networked Polity.

J	Inieke, O				Inieke, Otobong			Sustainable Development Goals, are we there yet?-challenges and shortcomings	WORLD JOURNAL OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Review						SDGs; Africa; Development		Purpose - Literature reviews were conducted with the aim of analysing and deriving evidence and reference points. A qualitative research approach was also used in order to properly identify situations, problems and solutions related to the particular context of sustainable development with Africa as a focus. Design/methodology/approach - The Sustainable Development Goals are a commendable metric and framework by which to measure practical improvements in various governments, communities or socioeconomic regions. There is also the reality of adapting and implementing this framework to the dynamic nature of myriad environments consisting of many distinct cultures, ideologies and lifestyles. The purpose of this article is to briefly and pointedly assess the African status quo in relation to achieving the United Nations' (UN) prescribed Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The African challenges and shortcomings in this regard are addressed and ideas for solutions are also looked into. Findings - Economic inadequacies and poor development are not always rooted in a lack of resources or the will to act but usually as a result of bad governance, corruption and poor adoption of suggested strategies for recovery. This brings into focus the facet of the resource curse. It is seen in multiple contexts across continents that having reserves of resources does not translate to economic prosperity if the concerned region is weighed down by poor governance or stagnant policies. The article shows that though the journey to implementing solutions is challenging, consistent commitment to trusted development frameworks and social programs will benefit many communities and spark projects for economic self-sufficiency. Originality/value - This article is important because it is a quick and concise snapshot about the realities experienced by a contemporary African attempting to evaluate the cumulative value and worth of the UN prescribed SDGs. This work is also valuable to academic institutions and young/aspiring researchers alike, it can serve as a compact reference point that analyses the realities of the concept of the "resource curse" in relation to attainable SDGs.

For the retrospective analysis of the global agendas, the authors use the modified definition of Rametsteiner's good governance to examine selected literature of academic analyses and publicized official documents and statistics. In doing so, the study postulates a complex web of power holders in the agenda-making process on the global level, which functions as a mechanism to exert significant influence to re-orient education agendas in the global community. The study finds that from the perspective of global governance of education, the governance of EFA was weak in the dimensions of accountability and effectiveness. MDG governance was stronger than EFA's, but this strength cannot be interpreted as good, or ideal, governance. The actual process of MDG agenda setting, despite the pervading rhetoric of country ownership and development partnership, is overwhelmingly donor-centered, which contradicts the dimensions of norms and rules as well as participation. The analysis on the governance of EFA and the MDGs verify that power asymmetry is inevitable in a multi-stakeholder governance approach. Such contradictory relations among the dimensions of good global governance puts SDG 4 in a dilemma. Therefore, the study emphasizes the importance of securing effectiveness and accountability for SDG 4. Otherwise, the future of the education SDG will be unpromising.

This chapter argues that cooperation between organizations can be a key success factor and at the same time be regarded as an applied governance practice and the link between theoretical considerations and practical implementation. Design - The chapter describes the theoretical and conceptual ties between cooperation and governance. Based on an organizational development project, the potential applications and their implementations are illustrated. Findings - Based on theoretical considerations, practical research, and demonstrated using a case study, some factors of success of collaboration are identified. Using these success factors as a framework, the concrete case study is reviewed and conclusions for interventions and the behavior of consultants are named. Originality and value - The findings of this chapter can serve scientists but especially practitioners such as senior executives, managers or organization development (OD) experts as helpful guidelines and orientations when it comes to implement sustainable organizational solutions cooperatively in the field of public governance. In addition to the illustration of practical applied essential process and implementation steps, the chapter provides conceptual information for the anchoring of sustainable development in cooperative relations in the field of public governance.

However, few studies have sys-tematically investigated sustainable development at the city level, especially in China. To fill this gap, we adopted the SDG framework to establish holistic urban metrics tailored to China's context. We empirically examined the city-level scaling effects and found that the urban metrics of China's prefectural cities basically fit into the scaling theory, that socioeconomic attributes are in super-linear relations with population while urban infrastructures show sub-linearity. Moreover, when the effects of per capita built-up area and GDP are controlled, the population still correlates to many metrics. This study provides a more nuanced understanding of urban scaling patterns, considering China's unique city governance regime and land-centered urbanization pathway when evaluating their sustainable development progress, which helps inform custom-fit planning strategies for a better future.

While it pays tribute to the complexities of steering in poly-centred, globalised societies, its fuzziness makes it difficult to oversee who actually steers whom and with what means. By focussing mainly on actor constellations, the article disentangles governance into seven basic types of regulation, four of them representing public policies with varying degrees of government involvement and three depending solely on civil society (civil regulation), on businesses (industry or business self-regulation) or on both (civil co-regulation). Although each of the seven types is well known and extensively researched, they are rarely joined in a synoptic view, making it difficult to grasp the totality of contemporary governance. After introducing the seven basic types of regulation and co-regulation, the article addresses the interactions between them and it adds the widely used concepts of hybrid regulation and meta-governance in distinct ways. The synoptic view provided here helps to comprehend how governmental deregulation has been accompanied by soft governmental regulation as well as "societal re-regulation". The concluding discussion emphasises that this "regulatory reconfiguration" is the cumulative product of countless, more or less spontaneous initiatives that coincide with forceful global trends. It also stresses that the various forms of regulation by civil society and business actors are not simply alternatives or complements to but often key prerequisites for effective public policies. Although the essentials of the typology developed here can be applied universally to a variety of policy issues, I focus it on how businesses are steered towards sustainable development and Corporate Social Responsibility.

Transboundary commons are a category of environmental goods that traverse jurisdictions and property regimes within as well as between nation-states. They are forged through collaborative partnerships between spatially dispersed state, private-sector, and societal institutions and actors. This article disaggregates these transboundary commoning arrangements into two geographically discrete yet conceptually intertwined categories of governance: mobile commons and in situ commons. We ground our enquiry in Southeast Asia, a resource-rich region where diverse formal and informal practices of resource organization blur the boundaries of environmental governance. Whereas environmental commons are often analyzed in terms of resource rights and entitlements, this article argues that a focus on power relations offers a more productive analytical lens through which to understand the dynamic and networked ways in which transboundary common property is continually being (re)made through processes of hybrid governance in response to changing ecological systems and shifting social realities. Key Words: ASEAN, common property, cross-border governance, environmental commons, hybrid governance.

Business and governments are now confronted with managing the expectations of a society increasingly aware of the social and environmental impacts and risks associated with economic development and demanding more equitable distribution and democratic management of such risks. The closed managerialist decision-making of the powerful bureaucracies and corporations of the industrial era is informed by traditional management theory which cannot provide a framework for the adequate governance of these risks. Recent socio-political theories have conceptualised some key themes that must be addressed in a more fitting approach to governance. We identify more recent management and governance theory which addresses these themes and develop a process-based approach to governance of environmental disputes that allows for the evolving nature of stakeholder relations in a highly complex multiple stakeholder arena.

Taking the Pak Beng hydropower project in Laos as a case study, this paper looks at participation and politics in transboundary hydropower development, how the latter is revealed by multiple, parallel institutional architectures in hydropower decision-making across scales, and its implications for transboundary environmental governance. We look at the institutional disjuncture in hydropower decision-making, how it is (re)produced by powerful, albeit conflicting narratives at respectively national and transboundary levels, power relations shaping these narratives, and how these translate into local community's limited ability to convey their voices and represent their development needs. Conceptually, the paper sheds light on the underlying politics in transboundary environmental governance by bringing to light the structural factors that prevent participation, including how these factors are justified, sustained and to a certain extent reproduced as an integral part of legal, policy, and institutional landscapes that govern hydropower decision-making across scales (e.g., local to transboundary).

What did the Go4Health policy research project contribute to the policy discourse on the sustainable development goals? A reflexive review	GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH			English	Review						Sustainable development goals; Right to health; Universal health coverage; Marginalized communities; Global health governance; Integration; Policy	UNIVERSAL HEALTH COVERAGE; DEVELOPMENT AGENDA; GLOBAL HEALTH; RIGHTS; PERSPECTIVES; GOVERNANCE; FRAMEWORK; AGENCIES	Background: In 2012, the European Commission funded Go4Health-Goals and Governance for Global Health, a consortium of 13 academic research and human rights institutions from both Global North and South-to track the evolution of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and provide ongoing policy advice. This paper reviews the research outputs published between 2012 and 2016, analyzing the thematic content of the publications, and the influence on global health and development discourse through citation metrics. Findings and discussion: Analysis of the 54 published papers showed 6 dominant themes related to the SDGs: the formulation process for the SDG health goal; the right to health; Universal Health Coverage; voices of marginalized peoples; global health governance; and the integration of health across the other SDGs. The papers combined advocacy-particularly for the right to health and its potential embodiment in Universal Health Coverage-with qualitative research and analysis of policy and stakeholders. Go4Health's publications on the right to health, global health governance and the voices of marginalized peoples in relation to the SDGs represented a substantial proportion of papers published for these topics. Go4Health analysis of the right to health clarified its elements and their application to Universal Health Coverage, global health governance, financing the SDGs and access to medicines. Qualitative research identified correspondence between perceptions of marginalized peoples and right to health principles, and reluctance among multilateral organizations to explicitly represent the right to health in the goals, despite their acknowledgement of their importance. Citation metrics analysis confirmed an average of 5.5 citations per paper, with a field-weighted citation impact of 2.24 for the 43 peer reviewed publications. Citations in the academic literature and UN policy documents confirmed the impact of Go4Health on the global discourse around the SDGs, but within the Go4Health consortium there was also evidence of two epistemological frames of analysis-normative legal analysis and empirical research-that created productive synergies in unpacking the health SDG and the right to health. Conclusion: The analysis offers clear evidence for the contribution of funded programmatic research-such as the Go4Health project-to the global health discourse.

J	Ortega-Dela Cruz, R				Ortega-Dela Cruz, Ruth			Perceptions of higher agricultural education toward sustainable agricultural development	HIGHER EDUCATION SKILLS AND WORK-BASED LEARNING			English	Article						Outcomes; Curricular review; Higher agricultural education; Purposes; Sustainable agriculture development		Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the purposes and current outcomes of Bachelor of Agricultural Science degree program in Austria. It identifies the ability of higher agricultural education (HAE) curriculum to meet its purpose by way of validating its current outcomes. Design/methodology/approach The study used survey research design to purposively sample faculty members and graduating students under the bachelor degree program of Agricultural Science at BOKU University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna. In addition to a self-administered questionnaire, key informant interviews were also conducted to validate the data gathered. Findings The Bachelor of Agricultural Science degree program in Austria aims to develop the student scientific understanding of theoretical and practical aspects of agriculture. The program also gears toward developing their lifelong learning skills. Analysis of the difference reveals congruence in the perceptions of agricultural education professionals and students regarding the intended and expected learning outcomes of the HAE curriculum. The findings affirm how the purposes and outcomes of HAE curriculum have been met successfully and their implications to BS Agriculture curriculum in the University of the Philippines. The findings are grounded on the firm foundations of Austrian higher education system from their strategic curriculum planning, design, and implementation to evaluation where all stages are done in consultation with the various stakeholders. Truly a community of dedicated members of the academic and administrative staff is a powerful tool toward curricular advancement in HAE institutions. Originality/value This is an original study that provides discussion on the link between a developed country as a possible model and a developing country in terms of HAE. It helps the HAE institutions realize the ways on how their educational aspirations will turn into reality when it comes to fulfilling their role in supplying a well-trained and productive workforce for the agricultural economy toward sustainable agriculture development in one's own country.

However, corporate social responsibility (CSR) is still quite a new management concept, especially for small and medium enterprises. Managers are facing multiple obstacles in executing CSR programs in accordance with international standards. Regarding corporate environmental sustainability (CES), the idea of sustainable development is a rising trend in today's business reality. Essentially, CSR is regarded as a part of the overall sustainability issues. For the purpose of studying the impact of CSR and CES on corporate financial performance (CFP), quantitative method has been used to examine the relation between CSR and CFP. Qualitative method has been applied to verify the relation between CSR, CES, and CFP. On the basis of findings, several useful suggestions are made for managers to improve business performance and sustainable development in Vietnam.

Our orientation to sustainability as it relates to China and Lithuania is both methodological and analytical. We view the impact of the Brundtland Report as an approach to temporal planning. It is also a solution to the problem of political legitimation for China and Lithuania, as time horizons differ according to differing sectors of the social system. There are layerings of horizons along local, national, and global development. Within the context of sustainability, the focus on development centres economic objectives and priorities of which government, business, and policy organizations must be mindful in their decision-making. All decisions create time horizon constraints. In the case of China and Lithuania, sustainability developments emanate from recent totalitarian regimes under a command organizational structure. Both now embark upon market economies, creating challenges for each in their efforts to maintain stability in transition. A typology of time horizons and an example of their possible impacts are discussed.

Simultaneously, regional and global ocean governance relations have changed continuously, particularly when we are trying to understand their differences within the logic of regionalisation, regionalism, and globalisation. The paper is generally based on deductive reasoning and reflects scholarship in security studies, political science, international law, international relation, development studies, and African studies. It delves into the critical aspect of understanding the nexus/relationship between regional and global ocean governance in critical traditional and contemporary ocean policy domains, specifically from an African regional ocean governance standpoint. Ocean governance processes that are historically confronted by globalisation, multilateralism, and post-colonisation are confronted by the rise of regionalism, especially the need for nation-states and regions to respond to and manage traditional and emerging ocean challenges. Responses to these challenges by various actors, including states, economic blocks, private sector, financial institutions, and non-governmental organisations, development partners, etc., result in different forms of relationships that refocus regions' activities toward globally defined ocean agendas. A review of different policy domains (including maritime security, environmental, economic, and socio-political governance) critical for regional ocean governance sets a robust background for understanding the contextual factors and concerns inherent in the regional-global ocean governance nexus. These outcomes, therefore, help us to arrive at a five-fold taxonomy of different types/degrees of linkages developed around the regional-global ocean governance relationship spectrum described as (1) discrete, (2) conflictual, (3) cooperative, (4) symmetric, and (5) ambiguous. Comparatively, experience and perspective from Africa are utilised to support raised arguments about these linkages. Furthermore, this spectrum allows for the diagnosis of the utilities and most prevalent arguments that regional governance's effectiveness is directly related to the nature of the interaction between regional governance schemes and global governance; and vice-versa. This paper's outcomes reveal how government, institutions, actors, and researchers address the relationship between regional and global ocean governance and generate a valuable way to think about current and future global and regional ocean governance direction while outlining some logical possibilities for an effective form of ocean governance.

J	Voss, JP; Bornemann, B				Voss, Jan-Peter; Bornemann, Basil			The Politics of Reflexive Governance: Challenges for Designing Adaptive Management and Transition Management	ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY			English	Article						adaptive management; embedding in political context; governance design; politics; reflexive governance; societal learning; transition management	SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS; SOCIOTECHNICAL TRANSITIONS; TECHNOLOGICAL TRANSITIONS; POLICY; COMANAGEMENT; SUSTAINABILITY; RESILIENCE; MODEL; STATE	New concepts of governance take account of ambivalence, uncertainty, and distributed power in societal change. They aim for reflexivity regarding the limits of prognostic knowledge and actual control of complex processes of change. Adaptive management and transition management are two examples that evolved from the analysis of social-ecological and sociotechnical systems, respectively. Both feature strategies of collective experimentation and learning. In this paper, we ask how these two designs of reflexive governance consider politics. Based on a framework of different dimensions and levels of politics, we show that they are mainly concerned with problem solving by a focal process, but conflict and asymmetric power relations, as well as the embedding of processes within broader political contexts, are neglected. We suggest two routes for integrating politics into the design of reflexive governance: (1) recognize the politics of learning for sustainable development and develop safeguards against domination and capture by powerful actors, and (2) systematically consider the embedding of governance designs in political contexts and their ongoing dynamics for political fit.

Issues of energy and water supply, linked to agriculture in rural areas, combine several of the SDGs. The current status and the challenges for solar photovoltaic (PV) electricity production and water supply technologies in rural areas are critically described and an outlook on future developments is provided. The framework of the water-energy-food nexus approach and its relation to the SDGs globally in the MENA region and in Egypt is presented and recommendations are given on institutional governance and research and development to overcome the silo mentality and enhance sector collaboration on all levels as prerequisite to achieving the SDGs. The latest technical developments in PV and water technologies and their opportunities for rural development are outlined. Combined technical solutions are highlighted with examples from Egypt. Specifically, installed systems in various rural locations are presented, and their advantages and shortcomings are discussed.

J	Shen, CH; Fang, BQ; Zhou, XL				Shen, Chaohai; Fang, Bingquan; Zhou, Xiaolan			The Relationship between Corporate Sustainable Development Performance, Investor Sentiment, and Managerial Overconfidence	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						corporate sustainable development; corporate social responsibility; investor sentiment; managerial overconfidence	SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; CEO OVERCONFIDENCE; DIVERSITY MANAGEMENT; CSR; EXPERIENCES; DISCLOSURES; GOVERNANCE; FIRMS	In the post-pandemic era, companies are facing challenges in their business development and may pay fewer attention to their sustainable development performance, whereas the investors are looking for better corporate sustainable development. Using a sample of Chinese listed companies during 2010-2018, this paper empirically examines the relation between corporate sustainable development performance, investor sentiment, and managerial overconfidence with econometric tools such as panel data regression and S-GMM estimation. Three kinds of corporate sustainable development activities as measured by Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) indexes, including consumer rights, employee benefits, and environmental protection, are proved to have a positive impact on investor sentiment. Compared to the SME and GEM Board, investor sentiment in the Main Board is less affected by corporate sustainable development. Furthermore, investor's high sentiment leads to high managerial confidence in the SME and GEM Board, and managerial overconfidence is self-correcting over time. This paper illustrates why maintaining good corporate sustainable development performance is beneficial for listed companies from a new perspective.

For this aim, corporate governance and related activities are important that broadly refers to the mechanisms, processes and relations by which corporations are controlled and directed. SWOT analysis is a method that considers Strengths and Weaknesses along with the Opportunities and Threats that exist in the incorporated body environment. Internal and external factors generate ideas about how their incorporated body might become more successful by using SWOT analysis. For logic comparison of these ideas, analytic hierarchy process was applied for SWOT analysis and important values of them were determined and evaluated rationally.

J	Malik, M				Malik, Maszlee			The Role of Religion for an Alternative Sustainable Governance Theory	CULTURA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY OF CULTURE AND AXIOLOGY			English	Article						anomie; culture; deprivatization of religion; desecularization; ethics; Eurocentric	CIVIL-SOCIETY	In post-modern times, there has been much empirical evidence to indicate that religions and faiths play a pro-active role in the field of civil society but more importantly in the development of societies, which is a major factor in political and economic development of a country, as well as its governance. Accordingly, the contemporary reality of plurality demands a fresh look into the narratives of different civilisations, cultures and ideologies, rather than imposed meta-narratives of modernity. Hence, explorations of religion and faith to develop an alternative notion of "good governance" from "other's" worldview are also necessary. Much could be learned from cultures, religions and faiths in the realm of governance studies from the phenomenological perspective. This paper is an attempt to explore how religion could play its functional role to create a sustainable governance concept based on values and ethics. It will look into the situation of religion at present, and how it fits into the framework of governance, and the arguments will be supported by examples and evidence of the viability of the relation between religion and governance.

The universal values as World Heritage Site are highlighted and the complex administrative framework of the Dolomite region (e.g. ownership, local government, economy) is examined. The principles, aims and structure of the strategy are discussed. The main focus of the paper is on the relation between the conservation of universal value for the future generations and the improvement of traditional models of territorial government. The main result is a more aware commitment by the local administrations to ensure the universal values of the region over time and a strong incentive to dwell upon the issues related to the mountain, such as cultural traditions, landscape diversity, natural heritage and sustainable development, with a new openness and willingness to discuss.

J	Wang, NN; Chang, YC				Wang, Nannan; Chang, Yen-Chiang			The development of policy instruments in supporting low-carbon governance in China	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS			English	Review						Policy instruments; Low-carbon development; Low-carbon governance; Chinese perspective	RENEWABLE ENERGY; EMISSIONS; ENVIRONMENT; TRANSITION; SYSTEM	This paper examines the development of policy instruments that support the low-carbon governance in China. The instruments are analysed in five aspects in relation to the key policies in low-carbon governance in China, including: energy conservation, developing new energy, reforestry, developing circular economy, and industry restructuring. Each aspect is discussed in three instrument groups which are (1) law and regulations, (2) industry standard and (3) finance and taxation. This research suggests that law enforcement for the new established laws should be further strengthened and stricter supervision systems should be in place to safeguard effective implementation of low carbon policies, measures and standards, especially for those energy condensed sectors. More rigorous industry standards regarding energy efficiency should be considered to help eliminate outdated equipments in industries and promote the introduction of more climate-friendly technologies. The industrial standards should be given strong legal support in accountability, in order to enforce their complete application once in operation. New policies and instruments need to be introduced in order to reduce carbon print by landfill. The backward law and industrial standards in China should be upgraded more regularly, therefore to support the low carbon development strategy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This article extends policy process theory by proposing the framework of experimentalist governance with interactive central-local relations or Chinese-style experimentalist governance, which combines three features. First, policy goals and instruments are formed separately and interactively by the central and local governments. Second, the central government is burdened with its own concerns about policy performance for maintaining authority and legitimacy. Third, the evaluation of policy pilots relies primarily on the responses of local governments. We further conceptualize three new patterns of experimentalist governance in China, namely, "comparative trial," "selective recognition," and "adaptive reconciliation," in addition to "hierarchical experimentation." These patterns are illustrated with case studies on four pension policies in China, which are for public sector employees, urban employees, rural residents, and migrant workers.

J	Guo, JNM				Guo, Joana Ngninnong-me			Understanding the mining-local governance nexus - a Ghanaian case study	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						local; collaborative governance; mining; development; Ghana	CORPORATE-SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; WASSA WEST DISTRICT; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; COMPANY RELATIONS; GOLD; INDUSTRY; LIVELIHOODS; CHALLENGES; SECTOR; IMPLEMENTATION	The demands for mining companies to play a role in local governance overlook the implications of their participation. This article investigates how the presence and initiatives of mining companies affect the roles of district assemblies in Ghana using the case of the Newmont gold mining company and the Birim North district. Employing a qualitative-case-study approach, the article demonstrates that the company's initiatives enhance the plan implementation and the revenue mobilization roles of the district assembly. However, the presence and initiatives by the company undermine the management role of the district assembly in relation to its ability to pursue holistic development. The company's initiatives have mixed influences on the representative role of the district assembly. Optimizing local governance in mining communities requires district assemblies to proactively engage mining companies to avoid a derailment of their roles. More research is required to unearth appropriate local governance frameworks for optimizing mining outcomes.

Corporate Social Responsibility (RSC) has many concepts but must be based on business ethics that focus on commitment to civil society. The methodology is based on the analysis of the theoretical approaches to the development of Paul Streeten and Amartya Sen. Development ethics specialists agree that the moral dimension of development theory and practice is as important as scientific and political components. As a result of the implementation of development ethics, the proposal for sustainable human development that is committed to the defense of human rights and the environment. Instead, the concept of RSC continues to change, essentially maintaining the legitimacy of justifying its decisions to society.

J	Joss, S				Joss, Simon			Accountable Governance, Accountable Sustainability? A Case Study of Accountability in the Governance for Sustainability	ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND GOVERNANCE			English	Article						governance; sustainability; accountability; UK biotechnology/waste incineration/transport policy		This article provides a conceptual framework for, and comparative analysis of, public accountability in relation to three recent British exemplars of governance for sustainability: the GM Nation public consultation on the use of genetically modified crops in agriculture; the South East London Combined Heat and Power waste incinerator to achieve a shift away from landfill waste disposal; and the London Underground public-private partnership to provide more long-term financial and technological investment in a key area of public transport. Each of these initiatives is characterized by distinct public accountability features arising partly from the context-specific tensions between environmental sustainability and economic and technological development, and partly from the particular governance processes at work. Together, these features point to several significant accountability shortcomings facing the governance of sustainable development, including: the compartmentalization of decision-making processes; the blurring of boundaries of responsibility; the prevalence of professional-technocratic discourses; and the marginalization of publicity. The article concludes by outlining measures to improve accountability in the governance for sustainability. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

J	Fuentealba, R; Verrest, H; Gupta, J				Fuentealba, Ricardo; Verrest, Hebe; Gupta, Joyeeta			Planning for Exclusion: The Politics of Urban Disaster Governance	POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE			English	Article						Chile; disaster risk reduction; land use planning; post-disaster; spatial injustice; urban disaster; urban governance	RISK GOVERNANCE; VULNERABILITY; INFORMALITY; ADAPTATION; RETHINKING; REDUCTION; HAZARD; FLOODS; CHILE	Many disaster risk reduction (DRR) initiatives, including land use planning, tend to ignore existing long-term inequalities in urban space. Furthermore, scholars working on urban disaster governance do not adequately consider how day-to-day DRR governing practices can (re)produce these. Hence, following a recent interest in the political dimensions of disaster governance, this article explores under what conditions the implementation of DRR land uses (re)produce spatial injustice on the ground. We develop a theoretical framework combining politics, disaster risk, and space, and apply it to a case study in Santiago, Chile. There, after a landslide disaster in the city's foothills in 1993, a multi-level planning arrangement implemented a buffer zone along the bank of a ravine to protect this area from future disasters. This buffer zone, however, transformed a long-term established neighbourhood, splitting it into a formal and an informal area remaining to this day. Using qualitative data and spatial analysis, we describe the emergence, practices, and effects of this land use. While this spatial intervention has proactively protected the area, it has produced further urban exclusion and spatial deterioration, and reproduced disaster risks for the informal households within the buffer zone. We explain this as resulting from a governance arrangement that emerged from a depoliticised environment, enforcing rules unevenly, and lacking capacities and unclear responsibilities, all of which could render DRR initiatives to be both spatially unjust and ineffective. We conclude that sustainable and inclusive cities require paying more attention to the implementation practices of DRR initiatives and their relation to long-term inequities.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Editorial Material						Global Health; Governance; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); Development; Power Shift; Sustainability; Humanitarian Crisis; Climate Change		The year 2016 could turn out to be a turning point for global health, new political realities and global insecurities will test governance and financing mechanisms in relation to both people and planet. But most importantly political factors such as the global power shift and "the rise of the rest" will define the future of global health. A new mix of health inequity and security challenges has emerged and the 2015 humanitarian and health crises have shown the limits of existing systems. The global health as well as the humanitarian system will have to prove their capacity to respond and reform. The challenge ahead is deeply political, especially for the rising political actors. They are confronted with the consequences of a model of development that has neglected sustainability and equity, and was built on their exploitation. Some direction has been given by the path breaking international conferences in 2015. Especially the agreement on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris agreement on climate change will shape action. Conceptually, we will need a different understanding of global health and its ultimate goals the health of people can no longer be seen separate from the health of the planet and wealth measured by parameters of growth will no longer ensure health.				ilona.kickbusch@graduateinstitute.ch		IJHPM, IJHPM/0000-0002-4107-8686					35	28	28	0	19	KERMAN UNIV MEDICAL SCIENCES	KERMAN	JAHAD BLVD, KERMAN, 7619813159, IRAN	2322-5939			INT J HEALTH POLICY	Int.

That concept bearing the traits of a paradigm has grown on the ground of broad quest for an alternative to the existing development model of the industrial civilisation. It has gained wide social acceptance and is the basis for many development and environmental programmes at the level of national and local government. It puts in a new light the socio-cultural, ecological and energy-related aspects of space as well as its value and aesthetics. A model of governing the city called 'good urban governance' is in a very close relation with the concept of sustainable development. It is based on the principles of inclusiveness, citizenship, accountability, processuality and effectiveness. Although this approach is not entirely novel, it stays valid and open to new challenges connected with satisfying human needs in the urban built environment on the basis of new contemporary conceptualisations such as 'smart governance', 'governing the smart city', 'network governance' and 'governance networks'. The advantages of this approach based on the assumption of multidimensionality and subjectivity, matching the various and seemingly contradicting interests with a sense of responsibility for the quality of life in the urban environment are often underlined both in literature and in academic debate. The aim of this article is an attempt to present selected practices in spatial planning which employ the principles of the idea of co-governance. It will include various methodological assumptions and criteria applied in 'good urban governance'. The intention will be to show its new research and application possibilities in countries like Poland where the idea of governance and sustainable development remains a matter of theory.

We use a multilevel governance perspective to examine the discursive and material struggles which take place in creating sustainable cities. In exploring the politics of implementing climate protection through development planning in Newcastle upon Tyne and transport planning in Cambridgeshire, we find that the interpretation and implementation of sustainability are shaped by forms of governance which stretch across geographical scales and beyond the boundary of the urban. We argue that the 'urban' governance of climate protection involves relations between levels of the state and new network spheres of authority which challenge traditional distinctions between local, national and global environmental politics.

The factors in each of these classes are analysed in relation to their effect over time, on the basis of 49 SAD programmes reported in the literature. Findings show that the social factors of engagement and empowerment, not often addressed in existing SAD programmes, are of significant influence to effect over time, as are the environmental factors of food safety, and the economic factors of production and capacity development. As such this paper shows that in in addition to the well-acknowledged need for knowledge and skills related to food safety, production and capacity development, SAD programmes also need to address the social factors of engagement and empowerment to enable sustainable change over time for SAD through participation.

J	Arena, M; Azzone, G; Ratti, S; Urbano, VM; Vecchio, G				Arena, Marika; Azzone, Giovanni; Ratti, Sara; Urbano, Valeria Maria; Vecchio, Giovanni			Sustainable development goals and corporate reporting: An empirical investigation of the oil and gas industry	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article; Early Access						sustainable development goals; sustainability reporting; SDG reporting; oil and gas; environmental sensitivity; SDGs	SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; ENVIRONMENTAL DISCLOSURES; GREEN GOVERNANCE; FIRM SIZE; PERFORMANCE; POLICY; INTERNATIONALIZATION; DETERMINANTS; OWNERSHIP; DIRECTORS	In recent years, many companies have started to include references to the sustainable development goals (SDGs) in their corporate reporting as a means for demonstrating their contribution to sustainable development. However, connecting company results to the SDGs is not straightforward, since this framework has not been originally designed for corporate reporting, resulting in high heterogeneity among companies and industries. Moving from this consideration, this paper focuses on a sector that is highly sensitive in relation to the SDGs - the oil and gas (O&G) industry - and aims to analyse whether O&G companies mention the SDGs in their corporate reporting and examine what are the characteristics of companies engaging more with such reporting. By conducting an empirical analysis of corporate reporting practices on a sample of 75 companies, the study confirms the relevance of SDG reporting in the O&G industry and shows the influence of company size, geographical area, the level of internationalisation and the economic performance of firms on the usage of the SDG reporting.

Governance and sustainability in Southeast Asia	ACCOUNTING RESEARCH JOURNAL			English	Article						Sustainable development; Content analysis; Corporate governance; Southeast Asia; Sustainability disclosure; Stakeholder reform; Corporate sustainability responsibility disclosure (CSD)	CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; REPORTING EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; LISTED COMPANIES; GENDER DIVERSITY; INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS; INSTITUTIONAL THEORY; DISCLOSURE PRACTICES; FIRM PERFORMANCE; GREEN GOVERNANCE; RISK DISCLOSURES	Purpose This paper aims to examine the relationship between a diverse set of corporate governance (CG) mechanisms and corporate sustainability disclosure (CSD) in Southeast Asian countries under national stakeholder reform. Design/methodology/approach Data analysis is based on 171 of the largest companies across six Southeast Asian countries using a 30-item CSD measure. Findings The authors find that there are wide variations in the levels of CSD across the countries. The findings indicate that board size, board gender diversity, block ownership and the presence of a sustainability committee are significant determinants of CSD. Additionally, whilst more stringent stakeholder governance reform motivates firms to publish more sustainability information, it fails to influence the effectiveness of the board of directors in promoting CSD. Practical implications Findings of this study highlight the essential role internal governance structure plays in monitoring corporate actions and enabling corporations to reduce their legitimacy gap. The findings further encourage regulators and policymakers to question, with utmost importance, the effectiveness of stakeholder reform in making significant organisational changes. Originality/value There is a dearth of studies that examine the CG-CSD nexus in relation to specific institutional characteristics. Existing studies mainly focus on a single country with similar institutional environments and thus limiting the ability to understand the "context specificity" of sustainability content development. This paper provides an overview of stakeholder reform in Southeast Asian countries and empirically substantiates the relationship between CG and CSD across six countries undergoing such reforms in the region.

J	Cirella, GT; Russo, A				Cirella, Giuseppe T.; Russo, Alessio			Special Issue Sustainable Interdisciplinarity: Human-Nature Relations	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Editorial Material						sustainability; human geography; environment; interdisciplinary societal studies		Sustainable interdisciplinarity focuses on human-nature relations and a multitude of contemporary overlapping research between society and the environment. A variety of disciplines have played a large part in better understanding sustainable development since its high-profile emergence approximately a quarter century ago. At present, the forefront of sustainability research is an array of methods, techniques, and growing knowledge-base that considers past, present, and future pathways. Specific multi-disciplinary concentrations within the scope of societal changes, urban landscape transformations, international environmental comparative studies as well as key theories and dynamics relating to sustainable performance are explored. Specializations in complex sustainability issues address international governance arrangements, rules, and organizations-both public and private-within the scope of four themes: sustainability, human geography, environment, and interdisciplinary societal studies. This book contains eleven thoroughly refereed contributions concerning pressing issues that interlink sustainable interdisciplinarity with the presented themes in respect of the human-nature interface.

J	Marchand, A; Walker, S				Marchand, Anne; Walker, Stuart			Product development and responsible consumption: designing alternatives for sustainable lifestyles	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th Workshop on Governance and Practice of Change of Sustainable Consumption and Production	APR, 2006	Copenhagen, DENMARK			design for sustainability; responsible consumers; sustainable lifestyles; voluntary simplifiers; material cultures		This paper presents insights from a research project that examines the notion of 'responsible consumption', its relationship to consumer preferences and expectations, and its implications for product design and development. The paper discusses the issue of sustainable consumption in relation to product development and summarizes initial findings from a study conducted among people who consider themselves responsible consumers. Notably, four different profiles of 'simplifiers' are described. The study shows that people who took part in the research adopt more sustainable lifestyles not only because of an ecological consciousness, but also because of perceived personal factors or benefits. The study also reveals that participants have both a close and distant relationship to objects and that they prefer products that allow them to be engaged in the activity of "doing". Product development strategies informed by these insights are explored. The paper suggests that product designers can support and encourage those already active or interested in orienting their consumption habits towards more sustainable solutions by envisioning appropriate ecologically and socially responsible product alternatives.

The Vicuna Convention and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Wild Species of Flora and Fauna (CITES) promotes sustainable use of the species focused on fibre production for the benefit of Andean communities, such as those inhabiting the Argentinean altiplano. This study describes and analyses the design, implementation and results of the Management of the Vicuna Conservation and Sustainable Use project executed between 2002 and 2015 in the Catamarca province of Argentina in relation to (1) the scope and objectives of the applied legal regulations; (2) the control of poaching and illegal fibre; and (3) the distribution of benefits from free-range shearing populations and the Fiber Redistribution Program (FRP). The availability of legal fibre has helped to maintain the region's textile traditions. The project financed local communities' development of their own free-ranging shears, but the low human population density in the Catamarca puna and the land's propriety have resulted in a mixed model with the participation of private, including large private international, companies. This management model among international and local government agencies, communities and private companies with corporate responsibility has led to the promotion of regulations for the sustainability of this iconic species.

It provides insights into issues arising internationally, implications for ESD in ITE and offers learnings for other countries and contexts. Design/methodology/approach A cross-comparative study design with overarching themes and within-case descriptions was applied to consider, compare and contrast governance characteristics, initiatives and practices from each context. Findings The approaches to governance, initiatives and practices that each country adopts are unique yet similar, and all four countries have included ESD in ITE to some extent. Comparing and contrasting approaches has revealed learnings focussed on ESD in relation to governance and regulation, practices and leadership. Research limitations/implications Making comparisons between different contexts is difficult and uncertain and often misses the richness and nuances of the individual sites under study. However, it remains an important endeavour as the challenges of embedding ESD in ITE will be better understood and overcome if countries can learn from one another. Originality/value Scrutinising different approaches is valuable for broadening views about possibilities and understanding how policies and initiatives translate in practice.

J	De Sa, P				De Sa, Paulo			Mining and sustainable development: territorializing the mining industry	MINERAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						Sustainable development; Mining policy; Revenue sharing; Decentralization; Territorial order		The mining industry today faces a new set of environmental, social, economic, and political challenges. Despite efforts deployed by companies to improve their sustainable practices, and the proliferation of international initiatives aiming at enhanced sector management governance, mining is again being challenged. Centralized management and contradictory legal and institutional arrangements governing public sector institutionsespecially the relation between the mining and the environmental authoritiescreate tensions between central governments and subnational authorities, mandated to manage territories in the context of decentralization. Given the lack of alignment in dealing with mining's environmental, socio-economic, and territorial impacts, central government's top-down decisions are becoming difficult to enforce. The politic dimension of the environmental and social impact assessment processes, in the context of poor inter-institutional coordination, accentuated the lack of trust in the formal procedures of consultation and increased the number of conflicts around projects. Revenue sharing mechanisms introduced by central governments to reduce tensions mostly failed to achieve their objectives. On the contrary, they often created new sources of conflict. To overcome this challenge, mining legislation must be harmonized with other sectors and adapted to territorial management. This requires participatory approaches to define integrated legal and institutional frameworks to manage the territories' natural resources in the context of coherent decentralization processes. It also calls for the aligned intervention of different levels of government using the Municipality as the relevant coordination space.

Sustainable energy governance in South Tyrol (Italy): A probabilistic bipartite network model	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Energy transition; Sustainability; Local authorities; Statistical network analysis; Bayesian analysis; Bipartite network models	STRATEGIES; LEVEL	At the national scale, almost all of the European countries have already achieved energy transition targets, while at the regional and local scales, there is still some potential to further push sustainable energy transitions. Regions and localities have the support of political, social, and economic actors who make decisions for meeting existing social, environmental and economic needs recognizing local specificities. These actors compose the sustainable energy governance that is fundamental to effectively plan and manage energy resources. In collaborative relationships, these actors share, save, and protect several kinds of resources, thereby making energy transitions deeper and more effective. This research aimed to analyse a part of the sustainable energy governance composed of formal relationships between municipalities and public utilities and to investigate the opportunities to further spread sustainable energy development within a region. In the case study from South Tyrol, Italy, the network structures and dynamics of this part of the actual energy governance were investigated through a social network analysis and Bayesian exponential random graph models. The findings confirmed that almost all of the collaborations are based on spatial closeness relations and that the current network structures do not permit a further spread of the sustainable energy governance. The methodological approach can be replicated in other case studies and the findings are relevant to support energy planning choices at regional and local scales. (C) 2019 The Authors.

The environmental dimension of impacts refers to any direct change to the environment resulting from social innovation activities, products, or services, which are not addressed by pre-existing systems. In this paper, we determine the role of social innovation in addressing environmental impacts by analyzing a database of social innovation examples in European and circum-Mediterranean rural areas, compiled within the H2020 Project SIMRA. We conceptualize the overall aim of environmentally-focused social innovation initiatives as furthering the sustainable development of their territories. To address the environmental impacts of initiatives in a structured way, we use the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) classification, to describe social innovation environmental impacts in relation to specific targets. We analyzed 238 initiatives from the SIMRA catalog and associated initiative websites to identify and classify their direct environmental impacts. Our results indicate that 68% of the cases have at least one direct environmental impact that aligns with a SDG target. The most common impacts are related to sustainable natural resource management (SDGs target 12.2), sustainable food production systems (2.4), and equal access to land (2.3). This SDG-based classification proved to be a useful analytical tool for categorizing internationally policy-relevant environmental impacts of social innovations.

J	Dong, L				Dong, Liang			China's renewed perception of global environmental governance	CHINESE JOURNAL OF POPULATION RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						A community of shared future for humanity; Green belt and road initiative; China; Global governance; Climate change; Sustainable development goals		China's idea of a community of a shared future for humanity (CSFH) has become the guiding principle and norm to be further embedded and integrated into the country's approach to environmental governance. Under the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, China strongly emphasizes the implementation of its national strategy to mitigate the global climate crisis, and construct international environmental institutions by advocating fair cooperation resulting in mutual gain. China's role as a responsible major country is expected to be more proactive in international process. In particular, the concept of CSFH exerts positive, far-reaching impacts on the greening of the Belt and Road Initiative and the construction of solid South-South relations. Based on the renewed perception, China shall undertake its responsibilities in the reform of the global environmental governance system by leading multilateralism to strengthen the capacity of relevant international institutions such as the UN. Driven by China's political will, this concept reflects China's more confident attitude toward global environmental governance. Most profoundly, mainstreaming the vision of CSFH will elevate China's role to a new level in the coming years in terms of norm creation in international environmental institutions.

The present paper offers in-depth analysis of the tourism potential in selected remote regions of Russia, the Altai Mountains and Lake Baikal with the aim to explore the specific features of their sustainable tourism development and to propose an integrated operational framework for sustainable tourism and regional development usable for similar regions across the world. The proposed integrated operational framework helps to achieve a tricky balance between economic resurrection of remote areas and environment conservation, which is possible only with the proper co-integration of tourists with the community, and local economic development with the environment. It presents a set of drivers and their mutual relations to achieve the successful sustainable tourism development in remote regions in Russia and across the world. The present research results contribute to a knowledge bank that could serve as a useful guide for academics and policymakers involved with sustainable development, geography or environmentally sensitive tourism.

Through literature review and modified Delphi analysis, nine key factors of rural sustainable development are first identified, namely industrial activation, working environment, living conditions, infrastructure, public involvement, rural culture, government-related departments, educational resources, and health and welfare. DEMATEL is then adopted to determine the classification of the aforementioned factors, in which four (government-related departments, public involvement, infrastructure, and educational resources) are classified in the cause group and five (health and welfare, living conditions, rural culture, working environment, and industrial activation) are classified in the effect group. According to the centrality and relation of these factors, the causal network diagram is finally drawn before making practical suggestions based on the overall results, with a view to providing a reference for decision-makers in their follow-up rural sustainable development planning.

J	Ghodsvali, M; Krishnamurthy, S; de Vries, B				Ghodsvali, Maryam; Krishnamurthy, Sukanya; de Vries, Bauke			Review of transdisciplinary approaches to food-water-energy nexus: A guide towards sustainable development	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Review						Food-water-energy nexus; Sustainable development; Transdisciplinarity; Social inclusion; Multi-stakeholder engagement	DECISION-MAKING; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH; ENVIRONMENTAL SECURITY; URBAN; OPPORTUNITIES; STAKEHOLDERS; LESSONS; RISKS; PERSPECTIVES	The burgeoning food-water-energy (FWE) nexus discussion for sustainable development reflects the ongoing transition from a silo-thinking to a transdisciplinary perspective in order to address challenges of the nexus practicability in real-world. Approaches to putting the FWE nexus into practice have failed to respond to the interdependent issues of resources appropriately and to devise the way societies are coordinated for such responses. Societies are critically important for advancing sustainable development and are thus placed at the center of the FWE nexus. Transdisciplinarity allows challenges to be framed and viable solutions to be found at the outset in an extensive and equal contribution of societies. This paper provides a systematic literature review to debate the current concepts and methods of the transdisciplinary research on the FWE nexus with the aim of developing a guide for socially inclusive sustainable development. Although the concept of transdisciplinarity has been widely accepted by nexus research, an explicit cognition of its practicability in real-world is still lacking, and sophisticated methodological development is required. As such, we proposed a conceptual framework to explore the potential contribution of transdisciplinarity towards linking FWE nexus practices and sustainability outcomes in real-world situations. This framework is useful in steering the management of nexus issues with integrative perspectives. Relying on the proposed framework, we made recommendations for successful transdisciplinary nexus practices. The future nexus research should be directed towards communication mechanisms and governance transition for balanced power relations among nexus actors, their representative selection, and timely involvement.

The present paper examines the challenges and opportunities associated with the implementation of sustainable development principles under the free port scheme. The authors analyzed the Russian Audit Chamber report on the activities of the free port of Vladivostok and compared it with the pioneer experience of the sustainable development of the port of Antwerp. The results show that focusing only on the economic and social objectives of preferential treatment is not sufficient for the effective management of coastal areas, such as ports. To improve management efficiency and fully integrate the coastal area with preferential treatment in the world economic relations, the authors consider it necessary to ensure commitment to the goals of sustainable development and propose a model for the implementation of the sustainable development principles, as exemplified by the free port of Vladivostok.

While WEF scholarship substantiates the biophysical interlinkages and calls for increased and effective coordination across sectors and levels, knowledge on conditions for effective coordination is still lacking. Analysing WEF nexus governance from a polycentricity perspective may contribute to better understanding coordination. In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework for analysing WEF nexus governance based on the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework and the concept of Networks of Adjacent Action Situations (NAAS). The interdependence among transactions for pursuing WEF securities by actors in different action situations generates the need for coordination for changing or sustaining institutions, policy goals and policy instruments that guide actions leading to sustainable outcomes. Coordination is attained through arrangements based on cooperation, coercion or competition. Coordination in complex social-ecological systems is unlikely to be achieved by a single governance mode but rather by synergistic combinations of governance modes. Particular coordination arrangements that emerge in a context depend on the distribution of authority, information and resources within and across interlinked decision-making centres. Further, integrating the political ecology based conceptualisations of power into the analytical framework extends the governance analysis to include the influence of power relations on coordination. Methodological innovation in delineating action situations and identifying the unit of analysis as well as integrating different sources and types of data is required to operationalise the conceptual framework.

This paper focuses on the rationale for various aspects of the development of social responsibility and social cohesion, and specifically in higher education. The article defines the importance of the values of social cohesion and social development and their implementation in the education of socially responsible youth. Listed the main categories in which the social responsibility of the higher education can be determined and applied for the educational management effectiveness. This article aims to show the role of social cohesion and social responsibility in the implementation of the principles of sustainable development, and to reveal the relations between the values of social cohesion and social responsibility and the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Methodology. Scientific analysis is carried out with the help of an interdisciplinary system of methods, namely, system analysis, interviewing, statistical data analysis, comparison, etc. Social synergetics and system approach are applied to the issues of education management. Results. The methodological approaches to the formation of modern educational and management models for universities are considered. The model of the social cohesion of the university community is analyzed. The university management strategy based on the values and principles of social responsibility and social cohesion is described. Ways to improve the economic and managerial efficiency of universities and society, respectively, are considered. The process of self-organization in education management and parameters of its ordering are defined. The most significant scientific results: the attitude and development of such values as social responsibility and social cohesion in the Ukrainian educational community were investigated; the sustainable development of universities as the best practice and factor of influence on socio-economic development was determined; the role of social responsibility and social cohesion as parameters of order in enhancing the sustainable development of universities and society respectively was substantiated. The practical significance of the study lies in the actualization of the need to develop social responsibility and social cohesion in the Ukrainian educational community, which is confirmed by statistical data, as well as the possibility of their application in the educational process and value-based management of education. The use ofthese results in the practice of education management allows us to create a model of social responsibility of universities and outline the directions of its implementation, to develop and implement a mechanism for monitoring the implementation of social responsibility, to study the actual level of social cohesion of the university community, to suggest ways for its further development, aimed at improving the competitiveness of universities in a globalized environment. Value/originality. The originality of the study lies in the combination of the two key values of the EU and their correspondence to the SDGs and the sustainable development of universities on the basis of value-based education management. A social synergetic approach is applied to issues of educational governance.

J	Ahlstrom, H				Ahlstrom, Hanna			Policy Hotspots for Sustainability: Changes in the EU Regulation of Sustainable Business and Finance	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						policy hotspots; EU business law; EU financial market law; sustainable development; corporate financialisation; reflexive governance	CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; FRAMEWORK; LAW	To ensure sustainable development, there is not only a need to re-think how the economic playing field is structured, but also the regulatory system that governs it. Business and finance law reforms will represent a crucial element of such a transition. However, little progress has been made to date. The European Union (EU) business and financial market law have been analysed systematically in relation to sustainability to a limited extent. This study aims to contribute to this gap through a reflexive governance analysis of corporate financialisation in the EU business and financial market law. I identify policy hotspots' with the potential to advance the EU's commitment to sustainable development. I use a mixed-methods approach consisting of social network analysis and semi-structured interviews. This approach allows me to perform a structural analysis of the formal institutional processes, complemented by a qualitative analysis that unpacks the potential of the identified policy hotspots. I argue that the EU's action has a path dependency created by two major policy approaches that have informed the EU business and financial market law. These approaches build on the shareholder maximisation norm and an action agenda on non-binding measures. This has contributed to internalising the corporate financialisation processes in EU policy-making and seems to limit the EU's ability to create sustainable legislation. While these approaches may represent barriers, the findings show that the identified policy hotspots represent two tentative pathways of action for achieving sustainable business and finance in the EU: the Sustainable Finance initiative and the Single Market.

As the public nature of the port resources, port economy and the exclusive nature of the ownership, during the sustainable development of the port industry, the government is not only the unique protector of the national port resources, port rights and interests, but also the main principal of the port environment and port ecological protection; not only the adjustment and control personnel of the port industry, the port economy, but also the formulation and implementation personnel of public policy of port; not only the organizer to build completed port protection system, but also organizers of the masses of people involved in port administration. Government should embody the role of development, but also attach importance to complementary nature of the port economy between the port economic development and sustainable utilization of resources, and the eco-environmental balance, to achieve the symbiotic interaction of port economy, rational utilization of resources and the ecological environment to build a brand new public governance system.

J	McKeon, N				McKeon, Nora			Transforming Global Governance in the Post-2015 Era: Towards an Equitable and Sustainable World	GLOBALIZATIONS			English	Article						governance; social movements; corporations; power asymmetries; multistakeholder platforms; transcalar and territorial approaches; human rights; transformative knowledge		This article reports on a dialogic symposium that brought academics from a wide range of disciplines together with practitioners and activists. The purpose was to discuss key issues conditioning the possibility of establishing global governance mechanisms which could promote transition paths toward a more equitable and sustainable world. Following the structure of the symposium, the article is divided into four thematic sections. The first contextualizes the discussions by looking at the characteristics and challenges of global governance today. The second addresses power relations in global governance with a focus on the corporate and financial sectors. It discusses practices of multistakeholder governance and public-private partnerships, the unhealthy levels of corporate influence on the UN system, and the dominant discourse that naturalizes corporate power, ` free' trade, and corresponding definitions of ideas such as knowledge, efficiency, and development. The third section turns to sites and forms of countervailing power and practice with particular attention to transcalar approaches and social movement actors. It highlights the potential of multi-level, territorial approaches for breaking out of hierarchical and nation state-based frames and building alternative forms of democracy. It illustrates the relevance of bioregions and ecosystems as meaningful arenas for thinking about and organizing social and economic life and for managing common pool resources. It invokes the imperative of protecting the human rights framework from the multiple challenges it faces. Finally, it explores alternative ways of generating and sharing knowledge and of challenging narrowly defined 'evidencebased' policy by assembling legitimate, qualitative evidence rooted in lived realities. The concluding section raises the question of whether-and on what conditions-intergovernmental multilateralism can be seen as a locus for transformation, and suggests some avenues of future research.

Studying a sample of large Australian firms, the findings indicate that the proposed attention-directing structures do appear to be linked to CSD in a manner consistent with the ABV. Specifically, creating awareness through scanning efforts links boards to CSD. Stakeholder debate, as a boardroom rule, is also significantly associated with CSD. Furthermore, as a so-called player' on the board, women directors have a moderating effect on the relationships between environmental scanning, stakeholder debate and CSD. The findings are discussed along with limitations and directions for future research.

This paper aims to reflect on the aspects of organizational culture that are particularly crucial for the implementation of sustainable practices at higher education institutions. Specifically, it addresses the research question: how do different organizational cultures affect approaches to sustainability governance at higher education institutions (HEIs)? It reflects on data from multi-case studies at eleven German higher education institutions. Four of the cases are analyzed in this paper to draw out the insights they offer on how organizational culture shapes the institutions' approach to sustainable development. A governance equalizer is used as a functional framework for evaluating and discussing the influence of different cultural orientations on sustainability governance. In addition to providing many insights and findings in relation to specific cases, comparison of the different institutions, their governance structures and their cultures of sustainable development helps to emphasize that there is no single cultural factor that can be identified as directly promoting particular governance structures. Rather, there is an active interplay between cultural orientations, which influence, and are also influenced by, the measures deployed. Such influence is not instantly apparent but needs time to develop, and it evolves in a variety of ways as illustrated by the case studies.

A New Environmental Governance	SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OF LATIN AMERICA: COMPLEXITIES AND CHALLENGES			English	Article; Book Chapter						Social-ecological systems; Latin America; Complexity; Environmental governance; Public policies; Adaptation	SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; FRAMEWORK; CHILE; CONSERVATION; PRINCIPLES; VALDIVIA	At present, there is no unified theoretical framework to deal with environmental governance issues. Consequently, there is a diversity of interpretations of the concept at the public-political arena both nationally and internationally. Recent Latin American efforts have given a step forward conceptualizing environmental governance from the South and systematizing experiences to illustrate a diverse contemporaneous reality. At a regional scale, within the last decades, discursive turns in national policies such as the introduction of the sustainable development concept have triggered an increase in studies and applications of environmental governance (e.g., forest's governance, climate change, marine coastal zones) including the use of the ecosystem services concept. The instrumentation of public actions in relation to environmental governance derives from the states. However, if analyzed with a beyond-the-States view, governance can be understood as a process involving the participation of governmental and non-governmental actors reaching decisions, for mutual benefits, through negotiation processes. However, there is not, still, within the countries of the region, inclusive and participative governance oriented toward the sustainable use of natural resources. Although there are many challenges, in this chapter we discuss two of them: (1) to build an analytical framework to understand the environmental governance modes currently available in Latin America and (2) to generate a new sociopolitical interdisciplinary framework involving both natural and sociopolitical systems as a contribution to a new analytical framework for environmental governance. In other words, new environmental governance for Latin America.

J	Rousseau, JF				Rousseau, Jean-Francois			Does carbon finance make a sustainable difference? Hydropower expansion and livelihood trade-offs in the Red River valley, Yunnan Province, China	SINGAPORE JOURNAL OF TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY			English	Article						Clean Development Mechanism; Handai; hydropower governance; livelihoods; sustainability; Yunnan	PERSPECTIVES; PROJECTS	The Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is a carbon credit trading scheme intended to reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and promote 'sustainable development'. Hundreds of CDM-sponsored hydroelectric dams have been constructed in southwest China's Yunnan Province, where carbon finance contributes substantial financial incentives to hydropower expansion. This article investigates whether riparian Handai farmers settled near the Madushan hydropower plant on the Chinese section of Red River have experienced positive outcomes from this project's participation in the CDM. I assess how Handai individuals' access to core livelihood assets has been modified following dam completion and probe how the CDM reconfigures scalar relations among the various stakeholders involved in hydropower governance in Yunnan. Though the CDM facilitates hydropower expansion, it fails to produce development that is more sustainable than 'business as usual' from a local perspective. Rather, the CDM consolidates hydropower governance in the same way as it unfolded in Yunnan before the province became an active participant in this scheme. The CDM also facilitates a national development campaign fostering specific socio-economic modernization patterns in China's western provinces.

Accordingly, our attention was directed on the Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs) and on their wellbeing particularities, with focus on the environmental dimension. The aim of this paper was to analyze the dynamics of environmental wellbeing in relation to human and economic wellbeing. Using national data of CEECs registered between 2006 and 2016, pooled, fixed, and random effects panel models were applied. The main results revealed that, in the considered countries, the economic and social dimensions report different evolutions compared to the environmental one. The economic components register a negative influence on environmental wellbeing while the human dimension and its social components are positive in relation to it, good governance excepted. Our paper also intended to analyze the relationship among the three wellbeing dimensions in both the efficiency-and innovation-driven economies of CEECs. In the latter ones, the economic component plays a greater role in determining the level of environmental wellbeing while, in the others, priority has to be given to human wellbeing components, especially the ones related to basic needs, personal development and health.

It also makes it possible to create structures supporting the determination, checking and achievement of the objectives of the enterprise. It creates suitable initiatives for the members of the administrative bodies and the management. In the integration with sustainability, featured as the business strategy, the long-term corporate objectives, efficiency, performance, competitiveness are pursued through the inclusion of economic, environmental and social aspects to the corporate management. The sustainability of small and medium enterprises in the Czech Republic may bring about its effects in practice through the analyses of environmental, social and corporate governance performance, increased interests of uninvolved groups in the issues, competitiveness, increased market share etc. The inclusion of sustainability in the corporate management of an enterprise calls for a change in business.

Place marketing-modern mechanism of interactive governance of development of spatial structures (clusters, cities, regions, etc.) which is based on the principles of priority of intangible assets, self-organization of stakeholders and support of the self-arising cluster tendencies. Thus territories are considered as social-responsible multi-stakeholder quasi-corporations making specific goods and advancing their brands. Social-ecological systems are considered (in development of approach of Eleanor Ostrom) as specific clusters which strategic governance demands use of marketing tools. Institutional aspects of formation of clusters are presented in article. Also classification of ecologically responsible companies of Philip Kotler in relation to territorial structures is modified; the new behavior model of territories-defenders of ecobrands is offered. Criteria and examples of various strategy of ecologically responsible behavior of territorial ecological clusters are given.

This generates functional groups of citizens capable of being responsible for their own development and improving the governance of their territories. In this regard it is important to analyze some questions about relations between public institutions and local associations, the role of these associations in the territory and the difficulties encountered in rural underpopulated areas. This article addresses these issues from the experience of more than 25 years of the Association Instituto de Desarrollo Comunitario de Cuenca in encouraging social involvement in the depopulated rural areas of the Spanish province of Cuenca. From this long-term vision, some aspects are proposed to successfully accompany this process, ensure the motivation of the population, the establishment of local associations, and the creation of sustainable partnerships that promote good governance and community leadership in the development process.

S	Li, YF		Holt, WG		Li, Yifei			SUSTAINABLE CITIES IN FLUX: CONTINUITY, COMPARISONS, AND CONCEPTIONS	FROM SUSTAINABLE TO RESILIENT CITIES: GLOBAL CONCERNS AND URBAN EFFORTS	Research in Urban Sociology		English	Article; Book Chapter						Sustainable city; urban political theories; multiscalar governance; strategic urbanism	URBAN SUSTAINABILITY; LOCAL SUSTAINABILITY; THAMES GATEWAY; POLITICS; CITY; GOVERNANCE; POLICIES; URBANIZATION; ENVIRONMENT; ADAPTATION	Purpose - Since the publication of the 1987 Brundtland Report, discussions about sustainable development have been nothing short of a buzz among politicians and academics. This chapter takes stock of an emerging strand of the sustainable city literature that recognizes local political dynamics, conflicts of interest, and power struggles. Approach - The review is organized into three sections. The first section reviews how past studies have utilized sustainable urban development as an opportunity for advancing theories of urban politics, highlighting recent developments in the growth machine, regulatory state, and risk society theses. The second section examines a range of studies that place the questions of scale, unit, and boundary at the center of inquiry. The third section draws together a body of research that interrogates different meanings of sustainability. Implications - The first section discusses the extent to which social and political processes in the sustainability age exhibit a pattern consistent with established theoretical accounts. The second section focuses on studies that address how urban sustainable development has brought challenges to existing configurations of spatial relations. These studies pose important methodological and epistemological questions for studying environmental politics. In the third section, the focus is placed on political implications of urban sustainable development, which is subject to multiple interpretations. Originality - This chapter ends with a review of an emerging thesis - strategic urbanism, which draws attention to the patterns of change in urban politics. Much of the contributions to this thesis are based on urban sustainability politics in recent years.

Additionally, this study aims to investigate the country- and industry-specific moderation effects on the relationship. Design/methodology/approach This study employs negative binomial regression model along with the fixed effects for industry and time in the empirical estimation. Findings This study shows that MNEs' internationalization is associated with their higher engagement in SDGs. This is owing to the pressures MNEs face from diverse stakeholders coupled with the need to build local legitimacy to overcome the liability of foreignness. The country-level results of this study suggest that this positive relation is stronger in countries with weak legal environment, countries with weak investor protection and in countries with higher SDG index scores. However, the industry-level results of this study indicate that the positive relation between MNEs internationalization and their SDG engagement are weaker in industries facing more competition and industries exposed to negative externalities. The results survive to controls for factors specific to firm and industry. Originality/value This study is one of the early studies which empirically examine the role of MNE internationalization and SDG engagement. Also, the findings of this study improve the understanding on country-specific and industry-specific challenges in implementing SDGs.

A key area of contention and struggle is likely to occur over the contribution of the RDAs to sustainable development. Although the pursuit of sustainable development is a stated goal of the RDAs, in this paper we argue that this goal is likely to be compromised by tensions and contradictions emerging in the evolving new governance landscape of England. In terms of promoting sustainable-development policy, the regional scale of the UK state is becoming materially and discursively significant, and a particular focus of struggles around economic and environmental issues. These struggles strategically intersect with wider processes of reregulation and rescaling in the UK state. We not only consider the practical policy implications of integrating the economy and environment at the regional scale, but also analyse emerging tensions in regional governance in the light of processes of social reregulation and rescaling within the UK state. We argue that theoretical approaches to the latter need to incorporate the uneven process of rescaling and the contingent nature of regional state forms and institutions.

J	Li, YB; Zhu, XF				Li, Yuanbo; Zhu, Xufeng			The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and China's Belt and Road Initiative in Latin America and the Caribbean	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						China; Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC); Belt and Road Initiative (BRI); 2030 Agenda; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)		During the initial implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (the 2030 Agenda), the Second Ministerial Meeting of the Forum of China and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) was held in Santiago, Chile, in January 2018. During this forum, China officially invited 33 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) to join the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). This study links three important global governance issues: The 2030 Agenda, China-LAC relations and BRI. The authors attempt to analyze how China's BRI in the LAC region can learn from the 2030 Agenda of the United Nations with 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs). This study shows that although China and the LAC region have strong political, economic and trade relationships, they must deepen dialogues and cooperation on sustainable development, especially the 2030 Agenda with 17 SDGs, which can be inspirations for China's BRI in this region. BRI, which aligns with the 2030 Agenda and contributes to Chinese experience in development, can generate new opportunities for the LAC region to implement such an agenda. However, the challenges and risks of BRI cannot be ignored, and adequate answers and solutions should be provided to allow BRI to achieve a win-win outcome for China and LAC countries. The authors also examine the alignment of China's policies towards LAC and BRI with the 2030 Agenda (17 SDGs) and the involvement of each SDG in these policies as the 2030 Agenda (17 SDGs) should be considered in policy-making for China's BRI in the LAC region. Moreover, on the basis of previous analyses, suggestions for a successful BRI in the LAC region in six sectors are proposed in the context the 2030 Agenda.

The latest communication theories emphasize the responsibility of local authorities to build communication with local people, to develop safe and sustainable communities, to provide services and infrastructure, to develop horizontal communication networks to promote community development and trust and reduce social distances between social agents. The aim of the article is to explore government-citizen communication in rural municipalities of Latvia from the viewpoint of local citizens. Tasks are related to describing of theoretical statements concerning governance-citizen communication in the light of sustainable development and analysing empirical information. Results of the research indicate average estimation of the communication with local government and the significance of informal communication networks in rural communities. Though municipalities in rural areas use different communication channels, including modern solutions, the situation analysis reveals a certain discrepancy with theoretical concepts and other research results, because rural municipalities in Latvia are more characterized by a "top-down" communication model, which is often based on power relations, is one-sided and formal. Government-citizen communication in rural municipalities of Latvia is regarded as an up-to-date, but insufficiently identified and evaluated tool for the development of citizens' involvement and place development processes. Therefore, further investigation and exploring are necessary to improve understanding of government - citizen communication and establishing of horizontal cooperation ties.

The bigger project of which this paper forms part seeks to explore the factors that condition academic decision making events and processes and thus eliminate or perpetuate student disadvantage, marginalisation and exclusions in a developmental context. The bigger project, which draws upon the work of the social realist, Margaret Archer, is framing higher education practices in reflexive and dialectic terms. For the second phase of social interaction, in Archerian terms, data was collected by means of analysis of organisational records and focus group discussions with selected heads of academic departments, deans of faculties and research participants, towards gaining deeper insights of the dialectical relation of structure and agency; in this case, of the leadership and management positions and their academic monitoring functions. The last cycle of the Archerian theory of morphogenesis included two phases, firstly identification of the various forms of leadership and management reflexivity, which reflect quality concerns, projects and practices about teaching and learning. Secondly, further identification and analysis of "situational logics", and possible correction of the current tensions of equity and quality towards the explanation of the possibilities/alternatives about the culture of conscious engagement, the 'intentionality' of student data and performance evidence as measurements for academic monitoring and support, which in turn, should constitute sustainable leadership practices. Discussion of these findings involves exploring the potential implications for capacity and capabilities development in higher education along the ideals of integrated academic development, hence the need for more iterations of the research process. What could be the context-based and sustainable leadership and management monitoring practices for social inclusion is also recommended.

J	Prove, C; Dessein, J; de Krom, M				Prove, Charlotte; Dessein, Joost; de Krom, Michiel			Taking context into account in urban agriculture governance: Case studies of Warsaw (Poland) and Ghent (Belgium)	LAND USE POLICY			English	Article						Urban agriculture; Governance; Sustainable urban development; Context; Case studies; Poland; Belgium	FOOD; GOVERNMENT; GEOGRAPHY; POLITICS; SPACES; THINGS	This article explores the role of local particularism in relation to the global interest in urban agriculture (UA). A growing movement is advocating UA, but future prospects are limited by variability, unclear expectations, vague responsibilities and leadership in the UA movement. We wonder whether the poor understanding of UA governance is associated with a "public discourse and academic literature that too easily adopt the generic and universally claimed benefits. We argue here that uncritical enthusiasm results in an overly instrumental approach to governance of UA with a main focus on stimulating formal (e.g., policy making) arid informal advocacy (e.g., civic engagement in UA). We do not deny the importance of formal and informal advocacy in UA development, but rather claim that the potential of UA needs a more nuanced analysis. Study of the interplay between UA advocacy and a city's contextual characteristics is a worthy pursuit, as it may provide significant and more profound explanations for the divergence observed in UA developments. Case studies performed in Warsaw (Poland) and Ghent (Belgium) serve to illustrate the importance of context. The results suggest that neither case is likely to benefit from a governance strategy that only stimulates greater advocacy and institutional support. The inclusion of city-specific needs, opportunities and pitfalls of UA in the governance strategy can help to move UA toward its full potential. We suggest a policy-making strategy for UA that expands beyond the realm of food production alone. Ultimately, the aim is to steer away from assessing (and critiquing) UA solely against the backdrop of these generic success factors. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The model describes how existing and future theories, and empirical knowledge related to SD can be utilised to establish explicit linkagesstepsbetween fundamental SD principles and specific studied practices. The research model is intended to support planning, design and communication of a range of research endeavours such as individual studies, larger projects and research programmes. It internalises a number of insights from the current stock of SD literature such as explicitly linking local solutions to general SD principles, the need to embrace complexity and to use theory, the need for interdisciplinarity, and acknowledging SD as both substance and process. The model and its utilisation are explained and illustrated here by reference to a research example from river basin planning. The model is a critical and constructive attempt to establish structure and strategy in relation to the overwhelming complexity of the sustainability challengea challenge which urgently calls for reflective and effective research approaches.

J	Delibasic, M				Delibasic, Milica			INSTITUTIONAL IMBALANCE OF INTERESTS IN MARITIME TRANSPORT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT	TRANSFORMATIONS IN BUSINESS & ECONOMICS			English	Article						institutions; maritime transport; sustainable development; conflicting interests; institutional logic of sustainability	GOVERNANCE	The subject of the paper is a critique of ineffective institutions in the field of maritime transport. The aim of the paper is to explain the basic reasons for the existence of an institutional imbalance between the interests of maritime transport and sustainable development, i.e continuous institutional erosion in this sector at the global level, which leads to its impasse and jeopardizing sustainability. It .starts with one basic and two auxiliary hypotheses. A basic hypothesis is that the maritime industry sustainability implies a balance between conflicting interests: social legitimacy (including ecology - Monti et at, 2020) and economic efficiency. Auxiliary hypotheses are a) in the near fixture, the institutional logic of sustainability must dominate in relation to business-as-usual, and b) the existence of two competing institutional logics in maritime transport causes its reduced efficiency, i.e long-term crisis operations. The paper uses the basic methods of economics: generalisation, abstraction, description, analysis, synthesis, and graphical modelling. The conclusion states the verification of all hypotheses, as well as the fact that in the field of maritime transport there is a long-term institutional stagnation, which inevitably leads to loss of confidence in the system, various stagnant processes and institutional fiasco in regulating GHG emissions.

The stakes in the sustainable development are the ones of the survival of the population of Central Africa even that of the humanity in the planet. The possible relations between the mining industries and the sustainable development are the investments and the oil income. In Central Africa, the investments seem certainly limited but the African countries arrange important income received from the sector of the mining industries. The good macroeconomic management and the fair distribution of the recipes of the mining industries, good governance and transparency can assure a sustainable growth and a reduction of poverty and be one of control levers for an effective starting up of the development for the countries of Central Africa.

It shows that the importance of 'sustainable development' procedural principles has significantly declined in public agendas alongside the rise to prominence of climate change issues. Based on a study of the urban policies developed by central French government authorities since the 1990s, it identifies two main phases. In the 1990s and early 2000s, 'sustainable development' and 'governance' slogans were extensively mobilized in urban policies for the purposes of modernizing public action. In a context of economic, social and institutional transformations, these urban policies aimed at constructing local dynamics of collective action and encouraged the emergence of projects relying on incremental and deliberative practices. As of the mid-2000s, this dynamic weakened and climate change replaced sustainable development as a reference in urban policies. This shift occurred in the context of a neo-managerial restructuring, with central government authorities regaining influence over cities and urban policies being redefined around quantitative and technical objectives.

Gender equality is diluted in commitments made to small-scale fisheries	WORLD DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Environmental governance; Equity; Pacific; Sustainable Development Goal 5; Women	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; GOVERNANCE; WOMEN; EMPOWERMENT; AGENCY; NORMS	Gender equality is a mainstream principle of good environmental governance and sustainable development. Progress toward gender equality in the fisheries sector is critical for effective and equitable development outcomes in coastal countries. However, while commitments to gender equality have surged at global, regional and national levels, little is known about how this principle is constructed, and implemented across different geographies and contexts. Consequently, progress toward gender equality is difficult to assess and navigate. To identify influential policy instruments (n = 76), we conducted key informant interviews with governance actors engaged in small-scale fisheries (n = 26) and gender and development (n = 9) sectors across the Pacific Islands region. We systematically analysed these instruments according to (1) representations of gender and gender equality, (2) rationales for pursing gender, and (3) gender strategies and actions. We found that fisheries policy instruments frequently narrowed the concept of gender to a focus on women, whereas gender and development policy instruments considered gender as diverse social identities, norms and relations. In fisheries policy instruments, rationales for pursuing gender equality diverged substantially yet, overall the principle was predominantly pursued for instrumental (i.e., improved environmental outcomes) rather than intrinsic (i.e., an inherent value in fairness) reasons. Over two-thirds of gender equality strategies focused on an organization's own human resourcing and project assessments, rather than on direct action within communities, or for women and men reliant on fisheries. Our findings illustrate gender equality commitments and investments to be narrow and outdated. Critical shifts in dominant gender equality narratives and objectives, and an embrace of multi-level strategies, provide opportunities for fisheries governance and development agendas to rise to current best practice, and ultimately make meaningful (opposed to rhetorical) progress toward gender equality. The methodological approach we develop holds value for other development sectors to critically examine, and subsequently enhance, commitment toward gender equality. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Using grounded theory, this paper reviews new and existing research on Beijing's historic hutong neighbourhoods in relation to the housing, heritage conservation and hutong tourism sectors. Results indicate that sustainability as a theoretical category has at least five extant properties. Sustainability is relative, dynamic, normative, contestable and reflexive. Sustainability is relative in the sense that proponents of different sectors will construct it differently. It is dynamic in the related sense that this construction changes over time. Sustainability is normative because it is value-laden; one important ideal being that a sector should strive to become ever more sustainable. Proponents of different sectors will assert their values, hence sustainability is contestable. Finally, sustainability is reflexive in that the normative ideal may not occur, thus the sustainability of a sector will be reflexive of the nature of its evolving real world development. The paper explores the substance of these properties, together with a review of the several stages through which hutong tourism has passed in its short 20-year life, including the emergence of governance systems.

Environmental problem-solving is no longer concerned with isolated problems, but rather with reorganising the overall relation between humans and natural systems. Empirically, this is reflected in the ever greater attention to questions of institutional interactions (e.g. between the issue areas of economics and environment) and functional overlaps between parallel governance approaches. Normatively, environmental governance in the Anthropocene is concerned with questions of equity and fairness on a finite planet. This article scrutinises the theoretical interregnum in global environmental governance by first sketching the key empirical trends in global environmental governance; secondly, discussing theory-building with regards to four broad areas of inquiry: the questions of agency and authority; the structural dimension of global environmental governance; the related normative questions about legitimacy, accountability, equity and fairness in the Anthropocene; and finally the integration of governance research into formal approaches and the related incorporation of non-social science concepts into environmental governance research. In our conclusions, we propose some initial ideas on how to move forward in the study of global (environmental) governance.

In a smart city, urban administrators need to reexamine the requirements and pattern of urban governance, in order to pursue the sustainable development of the city and quality service to the public. On the basis of analyzing the new demands of smart city to urban governance, the paper presents a new pattern of governance of smart city multi-agent participatory co-governance pattern. Firstly, we identify the three core factors for the success of the new pattern. The factors are: the mutual trust, cooperation, participation, and collaborative partnerships among various governing subjects (government agencies, enterprises, the third sector and the public); support of ICTs; interaction among institutions, polices and diverse technologies. Furthermore, a relationship framework of these factors is put forwarded and the relations among these factors are discussed in detail.

Wan Nur			Polycentricity in practice: Marine governance transitions in Southeast Asia	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Environmental governance; Polycentric governance; Power; Southeast Asia	SYSTEMS; AREAS	Environmental governance systems are expanding in size and complexity as they become more integrated and ecosystem-based. In doing so, governance transitions often involve more actors and knowingly or unknowingly alter the autonomy of actors to make decisions, and thereby the ability of the governance system to self-organise. In other words, these governance systems are becoming increasingly polycentric, moving towards an institutional structure that is reported to confer a number of benefits to social-ecological systems. This article adds to a growing body of evidence on polycentric environmental governance in practice. It adds nuance to the normative and apolitical portrayals of governance transitions in general, and transitions towards more polycentric forms of governance in particular. We analyse the relations amongst actors and historical development of four large-scale marine governance systems in Southeast Asia to understand how context, particularly power, shapes the emergence and evolution of polycentric marine governance in practice. Our data indicate that transitions towards increased polycentricity do increase diversity and autonomy of decision-making centres, which can enable more innovation or flexibility to respond to changing circumstances. However, these innovations do not always underpin sustainability and equity. Coordination mechanisms are critical for channelling the power dynamics that emerge among diverse actors towards sustainability. Yet, in these emergent, ad hoc polycentric governance arrangements such mechanisms remained nascent, ineffective, or inactive. The transaction costs involved in coordinating a semi-autonomous polycentric system are seemingly difficult to overcome in low- to middle-income contexts and need investment in resources and accountability mechanisms.

J	Steiner, A; Kimball, LA; Scanlon, J				Steiner, A; Kimball, LA; Scanlon, J			Global governance for the environment and the role of Multilateral Environmental Agreements in conservation	ORYX			English	Article						environmental governance; global governance; international institutions; MEA; multilateral environmental agreement; sustainable development		The role of multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) such as the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Ramsar Wetlands Convention, and the Barcelona Convention on the Mediterranean has grown increasingly important, in the context of conservation management, during the last decade as human impacts intensify and cross national boundaries more often. In resorting to MEAs it is important to maintain a clear focus on their opportunities and limitations. They are a means to resolve transboundary problems with neighbouring states and adopt harmonized approaches, they increasingly offer access to worldwide knowledge, tools and financial resources, and they can give conservation agencies a stronger mandate domestically. But they are specialized instruments focused on particular problems or sectors. The threats they address and the solutions they outline have to be evaluated in relation to overall environmental and socio-economic priorities. This entails linkages among different problems and sectors at various scales. Regional and ecosystem-level approaches are most appropriate for sorting out linkages and priorities. Extensive capacity building is needed at these levels to foster the requisite skills for integrated approaches. In addition, new mechanisms may be required at these levels to coordinate diverse specialized regimes. This does not require a monolithic, top-down approach but rather ongoing flexibility and responsiveness informed from the bottom up. We should take advantage of the new directions highlighted by the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, in 2002 and other recent international conferences to build these abilities into international governance. Conservation managers have an important role to play. By working nationally and internationally they can inform and influence the shift towards integrated and coordinated efforts, suggesting ways to accomplish this on a larger, international scale based on concrete experience in situ.

Blue Economy and Competing Discourses in International Oceans Governance	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT & DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						global environmental governance; green economy; natural capital; oceans; Rio+20; small island developing states; small-scale fisheries	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; GREEN ECONOMY; CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY; CONVENTION; POLITICS; ECOLOGY; RIO+20	In this article, we track a relatively new term in global environmental governance: blue economy. Analyzing preparatory documentation and data collected at the 2012 UN Conference on Sustainable Development (i.e., Rio+20), we show how the term entered into use and how it was articulated within four competing discourses regarding human-ocean relations: (a) oceans as natural capital, (b) oceans as good business, (c) oceans as integral to Pacific Small Island Developing States, and (d) oceans as small-scale fisheries livelihoods. Blue economy was consistently invoked to connect oceans with Rio+20's green economy theme; however, different actors worked to further define the term in ways that prioritized particular oceans problems, solutions, and participants. It is not clear whether blue economy will eventually be understood singularly or as the domain of a particular actor or discourse. We explore possibilities as well as discuss discourse in global environmental governance as powerful and precarious.

This article draws attention to an important element that can help to explain the emergence of this diversity in governance practices: the role of nanotechnology in nation-building. By investigating the relation between nanotechnology and the nation in India, the article demonstrates that various particularities of the Indian governance of nanotechnology can be explained by the relation between science, technology, and nation-building. The article discusses four instances in which the governance of nanotechnology in India is informed by the role science and technology has in nation-building: the historical image of India as a country that can attain modernity and development by engaging with modern science and technology supported the government's decision to free funds for nanotechnology research; the view of India as a country that cannot rely on foreign assistance to get access to the latest technologies reinforced the strategy to pro-actively pursue nanotechnology research and development itself; the historical use of science and technology as crucial elements in overcoming deeply rooted societal divisions enabled the science-centered way in which nanotechnology was governed; and the Indian ambition to become a global superpower informed the governance of nanotechnology as an object of international competition. The governance of nanotechnology in turn defines Indianness' in a post-liberalization world.

This, however, entails different meanings and challenges across the world. Kenya, in particular, needs to address serious sustainability threats, like poverty and lack of modern and affordable energy access. This study uses a multi-criteria group decision aid and consensus measuring framework, to integrate both agendas, and engages with Kenyan stakeholders to help inform future mitigation research and policy in the country. Results showed that stakeholders highlight topics largely underrepresented in model-based mitigation analysis, such as biodiversity preservation and demand-side transformations, while pointing to gaps in cross-sectoral policies in relation to access to modern energy, agriculture, life on land, and climate change mitigation. With numerous past and recent policies aiming at these issues, persistent stakeholder concerns over these topics hint at limited success. Sectoral and technological priorities only recently emphasised in Kenyan policy efforts are also correlated with stakeholders' concerns, highlighting that progress is not only a matter of legislation, but also of coordination, consistency of targets, and comprehensibility. Higher bias is found among the preferences of stakeholders coming from the country's private sector. Results from this exercise can inform national policymakers on effectively reshaping the future direction of the country, as well as modelling efforts aimed at underpinning Kenya's energy, climate and sustainable development policy.

The importance of tourism for the island's economy makes the study of the political influences on the new-found goal of sustainable tourism development imperative. This paper investigates the political factors influencing sustainable tourism implementation in Cyprus. Analysis is informed by Lukes' conceptualisation of power relations. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with key stake-holders, the findings suggest that sustainable tourism implementation continues to be problematic, given Cyprus' complex political context, which is highly susceptible to external axes of power. The strong influence of the socio-cultural environment on the politics driving sustainable tourism inhibits its effective implementation. This paper proposes a theoretical framework and a methodology for studying the politics of sustainable tourism development. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Rosenberg, J				Rosenberg, Jonathan			More than a Question of Agency: Privatized Project Implementation, Accountabilities, and Global Environmental Governance	REVIEW OF POLICY RESEARCH			English	Article						international governance; environment; economic development; disaster & risk management; developing countries	POLITICS	With limited success, international relations scholars have used principal-agent theory (P-A) to understand gaps in global governance. While P-A may not provide robust explanations, it is still useful for mapping long chains of complex, boundary-crossing relationships and locating the gaps that characterize global environmental governance (GEG). In this article, first I argue that we can get beyond merely locating and describing governance gaps, and start explaining them, by considering the problems of accountability that contribute to those gaps. Second, I argue that outsourced sustainable development projects, implemented by for-profit contractors, provide an under-studied and under-theorized body of cases for examining the relationship between agency and accountability. Finally, I use the example of a United States Agency for International Development post-hurricane recovery project in Grenada to suggest that when development assistance agencies privatize implementation they prioritize more economistic logics of accountability. As a result, they may enhance short-term economic efficiency and even become more accountable to their principals. But they fail to connect the means and ends of GEG, despite firmly stated, official commitments to "taking the environment into account."

An exploratory qualitative case study approach was utilised, drawing on fifteen semi-structured interviews with food partnership coordinators and on secondary data, to examine the differential priorities, internal contestations and capacity of socio-spatial assemblages to reconfigure socioecological relations. Our analysis uncovers an emerging (uneven) geography of urban food governance in the UK, pointing to the role of micropolitics in constraining the transformative and emancipatory potential of food partnerships. On this basis, we argue for a critical geography of urban food governance that highlights the importance of the political and economic context and spatial imaginary in shaping the contingent and relational character of place-based food partnerships and their capacity to engender systemic change.

As an objective we will start from its characterization and reuse to specify, in the empirical field, an approach to the analysis of experiences at different scales (Bombs Gens in Valencia and silos rehabilitated and operated in Spain). The methodology will be mixed deductive-inductive, based on the available bibliographic review, urban documentation, official statistics and field work. The expected results will allow to deepen the knowledge of the territorial strategies that generate resilience solutions, as well as the capacity of rehabilitations and interventions on industrial heritage in deindustrialized areas, demonstrating the effectiveness of good practices as a success option in relation to sustainable development goals (SDGs).

J	Madon, S				Madon, S			Governance lessons from the experience of telecentres in Kerala	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						telecentres; governance reform; sociology of governance; Kerala; Akshaya	BUREAUCRACY	Telecentres are seen as essential components of governance reform in the international development community and great optimism has been expressed in academic and policy literature regarding their developmental potential. The scope of our paper is to move beyond the confines of conventional governance ideology and to propose a broader conceptual lens through which to study the complexity of issues that need to be addressed in order to make telecentres sustainable. Following several years of experience with these projects, evidence shows that their long-term survival depends upon how interactions are managed between a host of players including the government, private entrepreneurs, international donors, telecommunications suppliers, local companies, civil society organisations and individual community members. This paper proposes that the sociology of governance approach is highly relevant for a study of telecentre sustainability. This theoretical approach is used as a lens through which to investigate issues regarding the sustainability of the Akshaya telecentre project in Kerala in terms of interactions between various groups of players. We adopt a practical reflexive-interpretive methodological approach to encourage the development and reshaping of theoretical ideas about governance through our empirical data. We identify five critical issues currently affecting sustainability of the Akshaya project focusing on how relations and exchanges have been managed over time. Our analysis has important theoretical and policy implications for the Akshaya project and more generally for telecentre initiatives launched as part of governance reform in developing countries.

The Yellow Sea LME (YSLME) is one of the most heavily exploited LMEs in the world, and its sustainable development has been heavily threatened by human activities, with negative impacts on the economies of bordering countries, such as China. With the aim of mitigating environmental threats by developing a low-carbon economy based on low pollution, low energy consumption and low emission, an index system for evaluating marine environmental carrying capacity (MECC) was established in this study based on the entropy method, and gray relation analysis (GRA) was carried out to assess the MECC of three main coastal cities (Qingdao, Yantai and Weihai) along the YSLME in China. The results verified the importance of the environmental carrying capacities (ECCs) of marine resources, marine economy and marine environmental governance for the sustainable development of the YSLME, and revealed paths for improving the MECC of the studied cities. Based on the results, suggestions for ecosystem-based management of a low-carbon economy were provided to help government departments to reasonably develop and utilize marine resources, protect the marine environment and implement sustainable development strategies.

J	Arruda, GM; Krutkowski, S				Arruda, Gisele M.; Krutkowski, Sebastian			Social impacts of climate change and resource development in the Arctic Implications for Arctic governance	JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISING COMMUNITIES-PEOPLE AND PLACES IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY			English	Article						Governance; Climate change; Indigenous people; Arctic council; Resource extraction	GAS; OIL	Purpose - This paper aims to explore the socio-political implications of climate change as the melting ice ignites new debates over territorial sovereignty of Arctic coastal states. Previously ice-jammed waterways are now open, and a number of recent geological surveys have identified new potential sites with vast energy resources. Competition over resources causes states to question each other's jurisdiction over specific parts of the Arctic. What used to be internal waters of one particular state can now be referred to as international waters by other actors interested in the benefits of resource extraction. Arctic indigenous groups, especially the Inuit, and Sami are directly affected by the current governance patterns that are fragmented across too many different bodies dealing with maritime navigation, tourism, fisheries and administration. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses a comparative study based on literature review combined with regional reports related to climatic and social impacts analysed jointly with live elements provided by international conferences discussions, workshops and direct conversations in "petit comites" style held in Norway, Greenland and Canada in the period of October 2014 until the first quarter of July 2015, with the representatives of Sami and Inuit communities. Findings - The paper demonstrates that Arctic governance is currently fragmented and the largest inter-governmental organisation in the region, the Arctic Council, has only advisory powers, and although its norm-making method helps with the design, it is not effective to implement Arctic-wide policies for responsible management of energy resources. Research limitations/implications - The research considered methodological aspects like the difficulty in measuring the elements researched mainly when dealing with the diverse nature of responses from the indigenous populations to environmental impacts and the varied nature of effects in different studied areas. Practical implications - As the Arctic is set to become the main global resource base and a major trade corridor, it is crucial to identify the dangers that poor institutional design can cause in relation to the control of extractive industries, sustainable development and the well-being of the region's indigenous population. Social implications - In addition to governance reform, social arrangements should follow to ensure the indigenous populations can also participate in the process to adapt and mitigate the impact of climate change on their traditional livelihood strategies. Originality/value - The paper provides an overview on governance reform and social arrangements to ensure that indigenous populations can also participate in the process to adapt and mitigate the impact of climate change on their traditional livelihood strategies. As the Arctic is set to become the main global resource base and a major trade corridor, the paper identified the risks of poor institutional design in relation to the control of extractive industries, sustainable development and the well-being of the region's indigenous population.

J	Kalfagianni, A				Kalfagianni, Agni			'Just food'. The normative obligations of private agrifood governance	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS			English	Article						Agrifood governance; Equity and justice; Private institutions; Rawls	FAIR TRADE; ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE; STANDARDS; SUSTAINABILITY; CERTIFICATION; LEGITIMACY; RESPONSES	Global agrifood governance faces enormous environmental and social challenges that demand the development of effective, just, and legitimate solutions. In this context, private governance institutions, in the form of private standards and certification schemes, have developed into a major institutional response in the pursuance of sustainable agrifood development. While International Relations and political theory have examined private governance institutions in agrifood from the perspective of democratic legitimacy and problem-solving effectiveness, surprisingly little attention has been paid on their relationship to questions of equity and justice, however. As a result we lack systematic understanding of the justice concerns raised by private governance; we cannot effectively address injustice in agrifood governance; and we lack guidance on principles that can attribute ethical responsibilities to private institutions. This paper makes an attempt to outline the basis for a normative framework on agrifood governance, in general, and private agrifood governance, more specifically by delineating: (a) the reasons why private governance institutions fall under the scope of justice; (b) the principles, subjects and dimensions of just private agrifood governance; and (c) institutional transformations to foster agrifood justice.

J	Jentoft, S; Bavinck, M				Jentoft, Svein; Bavinck, Maarten			Interactive governance for sustainable fisheries: dealing with legal pluralism	CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article							COMANAGEMENT	Legal pluralism creates problems as well as opportunities for the governance of capture fisheries. As there are important variations in the manifestation of legal pluralism as well as in the governability of individual fisheries, their assessment is of importance. This review paper asks how such a governability assessment may be carried out. For this purpose we make use of the interactive governance framework, pioneered by Jan Kooiman and the typology of legal pluralism relations brought forward by Bavinck and Gupta (2014). One conclusion is that because of the many variations between fisheries systems, one-size-fits-all governance solutions are likely to fail.

It critically reviews two central early themes in this area: community-based tourism projects, and the focus on structural conditions and power relations between global players and local communities. The paper considers the potential strengths of tourism development for LEDCs and summarises the many new subject area developments. A review of papers within the Journal of Sustainable Tourism's special issue on tourism and poverty reduction follows and four main themes are explored: development agency strategies and approaches, governance and biodiversity conservation, the assessment of tourism impacts and value chain analysis and inter-sectoral linkages. Key potential topics for future research and action are outlined, including: (1) the use of new techniques measuring tourism impacts, (2) the roles of development agency governance and operational practices, (3) how inequitable power relations and weak governance can undermine efforts, (4) the importance of private-sector business practices that contribute to poverty reduction, (5) the value of multidisciplinary quantitative and qualitative research tools and (6) the need for linkages between academic research and practitioner interventions.

Developing more participatory and accountable institutions for health: identifying health system research priorities for the Sustainable Development Goal-era	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article						Health policy and systems research; research priorities; evidence-based policy; evidence-to-action; Sustainable Development Goals; social accountability; governance	OF-THE-LITERATURE; COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION; GOVERNANCE; CARE; DECENTRALIZATION; MECHANISMS; COMMITTEES; COUNTRIES; FRAMEWORK; OUTCOMES	Health policy and systems research (HPSR) is vital to guiding global institutions, funders, policymakers, activists and implementers in developing and enacting strategies to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. We undertook a multi-stage participatory process to identify priority research questions relevant to improving accountability within health systems. We conducted interviews (n = 54) and focus group discussions (n = 2) with policymakers from international and national bodies (ministries of health, other government agencies and technical support institutions) across the WHO regions. Respondents were asked to reflect on challenges and current policy discussions related to health systems accountability, and to identify their pressing research needs. We also conducted an overview of reviews (n = 34) to determine the current status of knowledge on health systems accountability and to identify any gaps. We extracted research questions from the policymaker interviews and focus groups (70 questions) and from the overview of reviews (112 questions), and synthesized these into 36 overarching questions. Using the online platform Co-Digital, we invited researchers from around the world to refine and then rank the questions according to research importance. The questions that emerged amongst the top priorities focused on political factors that mediate the adoption or effectiveness of accountability initiatives, processes and incentives that facilitate the acceptability of accountability mechanisms among frontline healthcare providers, and the national governance reforms and contexts that enhance provider accountability. The process revealed different underlying conceptions of social accountability and how best to promote it, with some researchers and policymakers focusing on specific interventions and others embracing a more systems-oriented approach to understanding accountability, the multiple forms that it can take, how these interact with each other and the importance of power and underlying social relations. The findings from this exercise identify HPSR funding priorities and future areas for evidence production and policy engagement.

In the listed companies, this management orientation tended to generate divergences between insider and outsider corporate governance systems. The emergence of the concepts of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and Stakeholder Relations Management involves modifications in the corporate governance approach, according with the philosophy of sustainable development as critical element for long-term success in global markets. This chapter aims to make some considerations when the CSR adoption and disclosure as element characterizing corporate culture represent a factor of convergence between insider and outsider corporate governance systems.

In contrast, this article embraces an integrative conceptualization of water security from a governance perspective. A technocratic and supply-oriented water system may overlook challenges stemming from scalar mismatches at the territorial, institutional and discursive levels, as well as at the science-policy interface. Resilience thinking could identify new areas of concern and provide contextually sensitive insights into Hong Kong's water security, which will be subject to the restructuring of the water governance system, which concerns changing discourses, power relations and institutional mechanisms.

However, awareness and public participation, and political interests vary greatly among the UNFCCC Parties. Faced with imminent risks the international community needs to rethink geopolitical issues and environmental governance carefully. This article seeks to advance the debates on environmental governance and climate security by analyzing the process that led, in Brazil, to the creation of the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) in the context of an international agreement with legal force under the Climate Convention. Based on that, dissecting actions related to mitigation and adaptation strategies to climate change based on political and spatial questions; and exploring key-factors associated with public perceptions, awareness, ethics, justice, and risk. We conclude that the normative implications of the Brazilian environmental regulation related to the climate, the international relations and the geopolitics interconnect as a starting point for understanding what is at stake, the Brazilian attempt to forge global leadership on environmental issues and to rethink traditional geopolitical assumptions.

Building on existing literature on ITG, smart cities, and the emerging conversation on Adaptive Governance in the public sector, the following exploratory question has been formulated for this study: How are ITG structural mechanisms implemented in city authorities to oversee and govern smart cities? To address this question, a qualitative multiple case study was carried out across three city authorities in Ireland characterised by diversity in their ITG structural arrangements to govern portfolios of smart city initiatives. From this analysis three types of ITG structural implementation are proposed named: Detached, Integrated, and Traditional. These are compared and discussed in relation to: (1) orientation of each approach; (2) decision-making authority; (3) alignment with the IT function and the overall municipal organization; and (4) the challenge perceived by the SCFs under each ITG arrangement. This research contributes to the academic conversation on adaptive governance, smart cities as well as to the broader ongoing debate on ITG in the public sector.

Since 2008, the number of forest-based bioenergy plants increased rapidly, following the introduction of the wood-chips scheme and the high local expectations of its benefits for rural development. Obstacles to its continuous sustainable development have subsequently been increasing. Therefore, the goal of the study is to investigate the causal processes of bioenergy development to understand what threatens its triple bottom line sustainability. The study does so by employing qualitative system dynamics (i.e. causal loop diagram) and using interviews with local actors to elaborate on studies that look at the influence of power, institutions and expectations on the transition processes. Results show that the local actors' positive perceptions of the benefits of bioenergy mainly drove its initial development, but that conflicting local interests, power relations, and market dynamics now threaten these initially positive perceptions.

This increased the influence of actors other than officials from leading wealthy states, especially developing- and non-state actors, thus augmenting global governance inclusivity and decentralizing authority. The G20 became the principal hub of global economic governance by influencing and engaging with diverse stakeholders on its broad policy agenda. These networked-governance processes expanded aspects of multilateral cooperation, including transversal approaches to policy issues such as sustainable development. This analysis builds on recent literature on transnational actors, governance networks, and the G20; contributes to emerging constructivist literature on the normative significance of practices and social-relational processes in international relations; and includes a significant discourse-analytic focus on repoliticization and legitimizing discourses. This study indicates, in particular, the political and normative consequences of G20 inclusivity practices for integrating global governance networks.

Considering that the economic dimension is not an end in itself, but a means for achieving the other two dimensions, we concentrated on the relation between environment and society. Using the framework of Sustainable Society Index, we applied path analysis for identifying the effects of human wellbeing components on environmental wellbeing for 71 countries around the world in 2016. The countries were grouped into two groups-factor-driven and innovation-driven economies-according to Global Competitiveness Report. The main results revealed that once the society develops, the pressure upon the environment tends to move from the necessity of offering the basic human needs to the one regarding superior societal needs. While the least developed nations have to pay attention especially to population growth, safe sanitation and health as primary channels of better protecting the environment, in the case of the most developed countries, the main directions of environmental improvement may be education and good governance. Thus, a high environmental concern has to be cultivated in the development process, whichever its stage, but with distinct directions of action, as shown by this study.

Putting power relations at the centre of this analysis and drawing on the conceptual lenses of hybrid governance and critical institutionalism, we show the complexity of the fragmented processes through which decisions have been arrived at, and their implications. In the context of highly asymmetrical power relations throughout the basin, and the absence of an intergovernmental agreement to date, we argue that hybrid networks of state and non-state actors could be strategically engaged to connect parallel and fragmented decision-making landscapes with a goal of inclusively institutionalising the transboundary commons and maintaining connected local commons throughout the basin, foregrounding a concern for ecological and social justice.

Moreover, among female directors representing institutional shareholders, we can differentiate between those working for banks and insurance companies (pressure-sensitive female institutional directors) and those working for mutual funds, investment funds, pension funds, and venture capital firms (pressure-resistant female institutional directors). The effect of these categories of directors on CSR policies is also analysed. Our evidence suggests that women directors representing institutional ownership positively affect CSR policies, which is the same as for pressure-resistant female institutional directors, and pressure-sensitive institutional directors do not impact CSR policies. This research provides a new framework for the role played by certain types of female directors (female institutional directors, female pressure-sensitive directors, and female pressure-resistant directors) in relation to CSR policies, and thus, it may help policymakers to promote CSR policies and to take action to promote responsible behaviour among listed firms.

At the same time, governance is being promoted as an important concept in relation to forests, landscapes, land use and increasingly, FLR. Yet, both terms governance and FLR - are complex, and their association creates widely differing expectations. In this article, we analyse uses of the term' governance', and in particular, its use in relation to FLR in published articles, as well as related literature on forest governance, landscape governance and environmental governance. Our intention is to better understand how the term' governance' is used in the FLR literature and to demonstrate the diversity of interpretations and understandings, and subsequent fuzziness in its application. We explore the categories of meanings associated with governance, and also characterize trends in the use of the term in the FLR literature. Finally, we conclude by identifying specific challenges intrinsic to the concept of FLR related to the landscape, multiple objectives and the influence of multiple spatial and temporal scales, that in turn influence governance of FLR.

In that sense, the objective of this study is to analyze the relation between organizational competencies and the development of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria in the industrial sector. A scientometric methodology was used to analyze the production of scientific research on the topic. To define the portfolio, a search was performed using the Methodi Ordinatio technique in the Science Direct, Scopus, and Web of Science databases using the terms "organizational competencies" or "environment, social and governance*" or "ESG" and "industry". The study period was from the beginning of the database indexing until May 2021. The results indicate that the topic is relevant to the area of study due to the continuous growth of publications and global concern with ESG issues. In this sense, the industrial organizational competencies highlighted in the development of ESG include corporate social responsibility (CSR), and technical, managerial, and commercial competencies. The analysis demonstrates the positive relationship between organizational competencies and sustainable development, and the discussion is directed at the competencies that fortify ESG criteria and practices in industry.

The links between governance and the environmental principle of accountability seem inextricable. As a result, it is necessary to analyze these links and notions arising from the principle of responsibility in environmental law. On the one hand, it will be shown that the principles of prevention and precaution derive from the principle of accountability applied to governance. On the other hand, applying the principle of responsibility to governance issues requires defining the notions of temporary and emergency and in a current context of economic imperatives. This principle reorganizes private and public sector relations.

Goals and indicators to measure the achievement of the 2030 Agenda have to be localized. The paper presents the Italian current evolution of the territorialization of the SDGs, starting from the global level up to the local one, and wonders if the implementation of the 2030 Agenda takes concrete form with the quantitative monitoring of the SDGs at the local level (municipalities and not only capitals). A comparison among indicators proposed at different levels is set by using an ad hoc comparative reading grid. The analysis highlights that, in Italy, the principle barriers in the territorialization of the SDGs are the lack of data open sources, the proposal of new not adequately validated metrics by institutional/non-institutional subjects and the progressive loss of relationship with Global indicator framework and targets of the 2030 Agenda. The strategies needed to reach sustainable development are obviously site-specific, but we need to maintain common metrics in measuring performances in relation to the 2030 Agenda. In the Global indicator framework for the Sustainable Development Goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, it is possible to find indicators suitable to measure performances at the local level-albeit in a smaller numbers-but in Italy, there is no awareness about this. Italy is completely losing both the opportunity to compare the results of the effort performed by the Municipalities in a rigorous way and the possibility to use strong metrics to support decision-makers' policies for the future.

Resilience as a new turn in EU governance for the neighbourhood	JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						European Union; Resilience-thinking; Governance; Self-governance; Eastern neighbourhood	GOVERNMENTALITY; SECURITY	Rising from the margins of EU aid documents, resilience became acentrepieceof the 2016 EU Global Security Strategy, especially in relation to the neighbourhood. While new resilience-thinking may signify another paradigmatic shift in EUmodus operandi, the question that emerges is whether it iscriticalenough to renderEU governance a new turn,to make it sustainable? This article argues that in order for resilience-framed governance to become more effective, the EU needs not just engage with 'the local' by way of externally enabling their communal capacity. More crucially, the EU needs to understandresilienceforwhat it is-a self-governing project-to allow 'the local' an opportunity to grow their own critical infrastructures and collective agency, in their pursuit of 'good life'. Is the EU ready for this new thinking, and not just rhetorically or even methodologically when creating new instruments and subjectivities? The bigger question is whether the EU is prepared tocritically turn the corner of its neoliberal agendato accommodate emergent collective rationalities of self-governance as a key to make its peace-building project more successful.

Ground-level ozone has been linked to human health effects ranging from minor respiratory problems to hospitalizations. The results of the changes of the ground-level ozone as one of the air quality indicators are presented in the report. Three indicators related to the influence of ozone concentration on human health and adopted by different organizations were selected for the analysis. The hourly ozone data obtained at the Preila background station during 1990-2005 were used for the calculation of the 8-h ozone mean, AOT60 and SOMO35. The target value for the protection of human health (maximum daily 8-hour mean greater than 60 ppb should not be exceeded more than 25 days per calendar year averaged over three years) was not exceeded in Lithuania.

To carry out a foresight study of alternative futures of Iranian governance, the authors used futures studies, based on the detection of the most critical driving forces, which are also the most important uncertainties. Futures studies as an interdisciplinary field of study help to identify the events and trends that affect political change and offer scenarios of four alternative futures for the governance of Iran: Smart and Stable Government, Authoritarian Development-oriented Government, Irrational Government and Irrational Breakable Government. The authors believe that Iran's endeavors to promote democracy, taking the changing international trends into account, make a more trustworthy future for Iran both possible plausible. Design/methodology/approach - Based on macro-history approach and by using "shared history", future triangle and then scenario planning, the future of Governance in Iran has been analyzed. Findings - Whenever the government has distanced itself from the public and has neglected the trend of international change, it has been faced with a period of collapse and annihilation. And whenever these two important factors are understood, the result is a trend of development and growth. Therefore, the most favored image of Iran's future relies on the maintenance and promotion of public participation and on increasing attention to the sustainable realities of international relations. Originality/value - The complexities of events and trends affecting the rise and fall of previous governments of Iran make it necessary to use an interdisciplinary approach to understand the events that have emerged or are emerging in its governance. In this study, from futures studies point of view, transformation of governance has been studied.

Analysis of sustainable consumption governance shows the way authorities and intermediaries use food waste reduction projects to responsibilise' the consumer, including recent examples of shared responsibility. This paper takes this argument further by developing a strategies of responsibilisation' framework that connects relations between food system outcomes, problematisation in public discourse and strategies of responsibilisation in agri-food governance. A food and drink waste case study of strategies to introduce reusable coffee cups in UK coffee shops and food retail chains is examined to exemplify relations between problematisation and responsibilisation. We examine problematisation and responsibilisation discourses that have emerged in relation to the issue, particularly in relation to single-use plastics, together with emerging governance arrangements and their underlying rationalities. The case study shows two key things: firstly, how ethical questions about food in public discourses connect to wider environmental planetary concerns (in this case packaging in relation to the environment); and secondly, how responsibility has emergent and dynamic properties, which we term cycles of responsibilisation'. The paper concludes by assessing the wider value of applying a responsibility framework to examine governance responses to increasingly complex agri-food system sustainability challenges.

The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14, Life Below Water, highlights the need to balance the economic, social, and environmental dimensions when using the World's oceans. However, trade-offs arise between the imple-mentation of SDG goals and the well-being of different groups of people. The use of justice mechanisms is critical for achieving social equity outcomes from ocean use. Trade-offs in implementation between SDG14 and other SDGs in the Seychelles are examined through the lens of distributive and procedural justice. Content analysis of grey and policy literature and qualitative data derived from stakeholder workshops and focus group discussions are used to examine trade-offs between expanding marine protection through the Blue Economy initiative and Marine Spatial Planning (MSP), and the livelihoods and well-being of artisanal fishers. MSP limit fishers' access to marine resources through spatial, temporal, and permanent prohibitions on access to key fishing areas and gear use that negatively impact upon food security, subsistence livelihoods and well-being. These trade-offs reduce capacity to attain other SDG goals linked to alleviating poverty, hunger and good health and well-being. Consultation processes, by not giving adequate voice to fishers concerns and local knowledge, raise is-sues of procedural fairness. Trade-offs are largely borne by weaker socio-economic groups, leading to a failure to address issues of distributive fairness. Our research shows that the promotion of sustainable futures in the Seychelles remains elusive unless matters in relation to distributive justice are addressed and procedural fairness is provided. How justice mechanisms can be used in pursuit of social equity from ocean use is explained, and avenues for further research outlined.

Challenges to polycentric governance of an international development project tackling land degradation in Swaziland	AMBIO			English	Article						Erosion; Soil degradation; Natural resource management; Sustainable land management; Rangelands; Semi-arid	NATURAL-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS; ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE; MULTILEVEL GOVERNANCE; FOREST MANAGEMENT; SUCCESS; LESSONS	To effectively address the drivers and impacts of land degradation requires polycentric governance systems that facilitate international development projects (IDPs). This paper analyses an IDP aiming to reduce land degradation in Swaziland. A longitudinal-style qualitative approach draws on repeat household surveys, semi-structured interviews and focus groups. We aim to identify the changes that have taken place since the departure of the IDP funders, and the subsequent dynamics between stakeholders. We: (1) chart the evolution of the institutional structures and processes of the IDP; and (2) assess community perceptions of IDP outcomes. Lack of meaningful participation at various stages of the PMC caused the project to lose momentum following the departure of the funders. We discuss these findings in relation to a polycentric approach, and identify how multi-stakeholder IDP can be facilitated as part of wider polycentric governance approaches to inform policies to combat land degradation within Swaziland and more widely.

Although some previous papers have empirically demonstrated the casual nexus between country-level governance and economic development, this study investigates the relation of causality between public governance and the labour market. By employing Granger non-causality tests, we tested two hypotheses with regard to this nexus. We argue that bidirectional Granger causality is predominant for the relation of country-level governance and unemployment. Finally, our paper offers a complex quantitative analysis of the causal nexus between public governance quality and one of the most known labour market activity indicators for an extended panel dataset of countries worldwide for 10 years.

J	KREUTZMANN, H				KREUTZMANN, H			GLOBALIZATION, SPATIAL INTEGRATION, AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN NORTHERN PAKISTAN	MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							KARAKORAM	The internationalization of global issues has become quite familiar in the sphere of ecological problems with impact on the earth's conditions of survival. Development related aspects are now incorporated into a discussion of sustainability in which issues such as global governance, structural adjustment programs for aid-receiving economies, and control measures for migration play a prominent role. In a holistic approach towards sustainable development the interrelationship of environment and economy needs to be stressed and simultaneously the time scale of socio-political transformation needs to be considered. These developments affect high mountain areas of Third World countries in a similar manner to other peripheral regions. This paper focuses on four aspects connected with development issues in high mountain regions which are exemplified for Northern Pakistan: the function of international boundaries; the governance of conflicts on local administration; the impact of road access on regional development; and the effects of external interests such as tourism and conservation of nature on local socioeconomic conditions. These aspects have been selected to show the complexity of international relations, the high degree of integration into the world market system experienced by marginal regions, and the minority position of mountain people in this network Along these lines the hypothesis is substantiated that an analysis of interest conflicts, exchange patterns, and regional disparities is required in order to understand the present development processes in remote mountain regions of the Developing World.

J	Ramalho, A				Ramalho, Anna			The distinctive stance of the King Reports on corporate governance from a global perspective	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITY			English	Article						Codes; Corporate governance; King IV; King report; Shareholders; Stakeholders; Sustainability; Ubuntu		Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide a perspective on the distinctive stance of the King Report on Corporate Governance in South Africa, 2016 (King IV) in relation to a number of other codes of corporate governance issued globally. Design/methodology/approach The paper presents a comparative analysis between King IV and the codes of governance that apply in a select number of the jurisdictions, namely, Australia, Brazil, Malaysia, Nigeria and the UK. The selection of jurisdictions was done with the view of having a sample that is representative of the major global regions. Preference was given to codes that were issued or revised recently. Mention is also made of the G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance where appropriate. Findings The conclusion reached in this paper is that King IV is distinctive from the codes compared to it in this paper in six respects. These include that King IV defines corporate governance as accountable leadership instead of it being a system only and is drafted for positive outcomes instead of compliance; proposes an application regime that is qualitative instead of quantitative; integrates sustainable development into its model for corporate governance instead of treating sustainability as an ad hoc-matter; has applicability across the ecosystem of all organisations instead of limited application to listed or larger companies; and has a has built in a social value system to harness broad public support instead of reliance on bottom-down enforcement. Originality/value The implications of the distinct approach to corporate governance in King IV are explained in the paper and should serve as a premise to reconsider whether the more traditional approaches to corporate governance code development are still appropriate in light of the learning as evidenced in King IV.

The relationship between oil, fisheries, and coastal communities is documented primarily through case studies in individual jurisdictions and via the impacts of oil spills. Yet, the implications of oil development for fisheries and coastal communities are much broader. This study provides an extensive review of the effects of oil development in relation to four interconnected themes: 1) the environment, including marine habitats and fish; 2) small-scale fisheries and coastal community livelihoods; 3) coastal and ocean spaces, including disputes over territory and infrastructure; and 4) ocean and coastal governance processes. We map spatial overlaps between the oil sector and small-scale fisheries and point to the frequent displacement of fishers from fishing grounds due to increasing coastal traffic and infrastructure, and the catastrophic effects of oil spills on fisheries and coastal economies. Though the oil sector generally has negative impacts on fisheries livelihoods and coastal communities, these effects and their mechanisms vary across locations, ecosystems, species, and specific activities and groups. Overall, this narrative review provides a comprehensive account of the scholarship to date and points to key themes for future research, including intersections between offshore oil and gender, cross-sectoral governance, and the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 14. Underpinning all of these challenges and potential solutions is a clear need for stronger integration of social and natural science knowledge, perspectives, and tools.

Improving how CHW programmes are governed is increasingly recognized as important for achieving universal access to healthcare and other health-related goals. This paper, the third in a series on "Community Health Workers at the Dawn of a New Era", aims to raise critical questions that decision-makers need to consider for governing CHW programmes, illustrate the options for governance using examples of national CHW programmes, and set out a research agenda for understanding how CHW programmes are governed and how this can be improved. Methods: We draw from a review of the literature as well as from the knowledge and experience of those involved in the planning and management of CHW programmes. Results: Governing comprises the processes and structures through which individuals, groups, programmes, and organizations exercise rights, resolve differences, and express interests. Because CHW programmes are located between the formal health system and communities, and because they involve a wide range of stakeholders, their governance is complex. In addition, these programmes frequently fall outside of the governance structures of the formal health system or are poorly integrated with it, making governing these programmes more challenging. We discuss the following important questions that decision-makers need to consider in relation to governing CHW programmes: (1) How and where within political structures are policies made for CHW programmes? (2) Who implements decisions regarding CHW programmes and at what levels of government? (3) What laws and regulations are needed to support the programme? (4) How should the programme be adapted across different settings or groups within the country or region? Conclusion: The most appropriate and acceptable models for governing CHW programmes depend on communities, on local health systems, and on the political system in which the programme is located. Stakeholders in each setting need to consider what systems are currently in place and how they might be adapted to local needs and systems.

J	Wallington, TJ; Lawrence, G				Wallington, Tabatha J.; Lawrence, Geoffrey			Making democracy matter: Responsibility and effective environmental governance in regional Australia	JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES			English	Review						environmental governance; responsibility; democracy; accountability; responsiveness; natural resource management; regional governance	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; HYBRID PRACTICES; ACCOUNTABILITY; MANAGEMENT; LIBERALISM; LEGITIMACY; POLICY; STATE; FORMS	This paper will critically examine the changing social relations of responsibility associated with Australia's current regional, 'experiment' in environmental governance. This experiment centrally involves the transfer of responsibility for natural resource management (NRM) from Federal and State governments to community-based regional bodies. Although governments are promoting democratic NRM planning at the regional level as a more effective means of addressing Australia's environmental problems, we argue that a tension is emerging in association with the simultaneous pursuit of these goals: 'effectiveness' has been defined in terms of the accountability of regional communities to central governments for the achievement of short-term results, an approach which is undermining the democratic promise that regional bodies would be responsive to wider community concerns. The notion of,responsibility' provides a means of investigating this tension, as accountability and responsiveness are both elements of the overarching concept of responsibility. The examination of NRM institutions through this theoretical lens indicates that the shared substantive interests required to motivate a sense of shared responsibility amongst regional actors have been sidelined by the procedural demands of accountability. We argue that, if NRM planning is to be genuinely accountable and responsive to substantive public ends, the properly social and dialogical nature of responsibility relationships must be recovered. The paper concludes with a discussion of the social and political relations of responsibility that appear to provide the best opportunities for effective environmental governance, and thus for the achievement of more sustainable NRM outcomes, at the regional level.

Based on a study of the U.N. Earth Summits, we examine how actors meet every decade to battle for definitional control of what SD means for business, and what business means for SD. Through a discourse analysis of texts from business, policy, and civil society actors during each Summit, we illustrate how an ensuing discursive struggle shifts the role of business in SD from being largely undefined in 1992, to being considered an SD partner in 2002, and finally to becoming a driver of SD by 2012. We contend that these shifts occurred largely due to two field dynamics: (a) rearranging of field boundaries and (2) forming of a discourse coalition. Accordingly, our study highlights how disparate actors coalesce around a shared-meaning system and collectively shape the role of business role in SD. However, we argue that despite the allure of a unified meaning-making process between once antagonistic actors, business-SD relations are underpinned by politicized interaction where certain actors come to dominate, and, in doing so, marginalize others.

J	Darmastuti, A; Wijaya, A				Darmastuti, Ari; Wijaya, Atika			Gender power relations in development planning for forest and watershed management in Lampung, Indonesia	GENDER TECHNOLOGY & DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Development planning; forest and watershed management; gender power relations; gender roles; government policies	GOVERNANCE; WOMEN	Development planning of forest and watershed management is a critical step for a sustainable natural resource. However, the interests, skills, and participation of women are hardly considered. This research investigates the development of a gender action plan (GAP) in a program called Strengthening Community-Based Forest and Watershed Management (SCBFWM) in upstream Way Besai (Besai River) in West Lampung, Indonesia. Data were collected through interviews, documents, and focus group discussions. We found that there are inconsistencies in government policies regarding commitment to gender. Although West Lampung Regency acknowledged gender equality as a goal, which is shown through its vision, there was barely any mention of it in their local offices' policies, programs, activities, and budget. The gendering of the forest and watershed management has changed in recent years, with women's community-based organizations (CBOs) and the community having acknowledged the importance of women's interests and participation in promoting sustainable forests and watersheds. The gap between ignorance and knowledge within the government, in the context of more knowledgeable and skillful community members, may create tensions between governments, community-based organizations, and community members. This study hopes to strengthen the awareness among government officers in gendering forest and watershed sectors development.

This article highlights the case of a fruit and vegetable market in an informal area of Greater Cairo that was redeveloped by a programme supported by German International Cooperation. Although the market was developed using participatory methods, the vendors deserted it. Analysis reveals the conflicting interests of vendors and the district administration were reflected in divergent models of market operation. The paper recommends that development cooperation recognise the legitimacy of existing power structures and stakeholders' relations.

J	Hull, E; Evensen, D				Hull, Evelyn; Evensen, Darrick			Just environmental governance for shale gas? Transitioning towards sustainable local regulation of fracking in Spain	ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Hydraulic fracturing; NIMBY; Local governance; Energy ethics	UNITED-KINGDOM; PUBLIC-PARTICIPATION; UNCONVENTIONAL OIL; SOCIAL-SCIENCE; PERCEPTIONS; POLICY; ENERGY; STATE; IMPACTS; JUSTICE	Fracking affects a range of communities in different ways and requires a holistic approach to its policy formation. There are a multitude of reactions to fracking, and in this perspective article, we argue that all require representation. Whilst Spain, as a state with dominant central authority, has devolved some responsibilities the local level, these communities remain powerless in legislative terms. Nevertheless, various platforms, NGOs, and autonomous communities have expressed strong opposition to fracking and as a result have had a certain amount of success in halting the development of unconventional gas. Despite this progress in their activism, it is evident that public opinion requires more robust and complete representation. Labelling these movements as cases of NIMBYism seeks to detract legitimacy from their concerns. To achieve a representative and legitimate democratic outcome in relation to fracking governance in Spain, distributive and procedural deficiencies must be addressed. As Spain contemplates its fracking future, within its currently precarious political context, it would do well to learn from the regulatory and governmental failures in other jurisdictions and seek to develop a robust framework that solicits and accommodates the range of valid and informed perspectives held on this topic. There is some indication of movement in this direction; offering some optimism that such approaches could be systematised.

J	Manda, S; Tallontire, A; Dougill, AJ				Manda, S.; Tallontire, A.; Dougill, A. J.			Business 'Power of Presence': Foreign Capital, Industry Practices, and Politics of Sustainable Development in Zambian Agriculture	JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES			English	Article							RESOURCE GOVERNANCE; LAND; ACCESS; AGRIBUSINESS; RESISTANCE; DYNAMICS; OIL	Sustainable Development Goals have brought optimism around 'agriculture for development' but also questioned agribusinesses in sustainable development. This paper assesses how an agribusiness' power exploits domains to exert control over industry governance. Using interviews and group discussions from three smallholder outgrower schemes under Illovo Sugar Plc in Zambia, the paper demonstrates that corporations can deploy the 'power of presence' to influence national policy development, and sustainability in regional and local practices. Investment and trade policies currently foster agribusinesses but overlook environmental assessments that expose social and ecological contradictions such as on competing water uses. State-donor relations enable smallholder integration in sugarcane as poverty reduction whilst agribusinesses are limiting their participation through controls on resources and production systems. By analysing power expressions, we show how possibilities of sustainable agriculture and rural development are undermined by agribusiness practices. We suggest that current policy efforts around 'agriculture for development' in Zambia are about entrenching power and interests of an agribusiness, neglecting industry expansion and sustainability. The paper highlights the limits and importance of domestic institutions in framing large-scale agricultural investments as well as mediating corporate practices that will be required to provide a greater focus on national planning processes for sustainable agriculture and rural development.

Evaluating sustainability transitions pathways: Bridging analytical approaches to address governance challenges	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS			English	Article						Sustainability transitions; Transition pathways; Governance; Modelling; Socio-technical	CLIMATE-CHANGE; CARBON CAPTURE; ENERGY SCENARIOS; MULTILEVEL; INNOVATION; FRAMEWORK; POLITICS; DYNAMICS; SYSTEMS; UK	The paper sets out a proposal for bridging and linking three approaches to the analysis of transitions to sustainable and low-carbon societies: quantitative systems modelling; socio-technical transition analysis; and initiative-based learning. We argue that each of these approaches presents a partial and incomplete picture, which has implications for the quality and usefulness of the insights they can deliver for policy and practice. A framework for bridging these different approaches promises to enrich each of the approaches, while providing the basis for a more robust and complete analysis of sustainable transitions pathways that serves better to address questions and dilemmas faced by decision-makers and practitioners. We elaborate five key challenges for the analysis and governance of transitions pathways, and compare the three approaches in relation to each of these. We suggest an integration strategy based on alignment, bridging, and iteration, arguing that a structured dialogue between practitioners of different approaches is needed. In practical terms, such a dialogue would be organised around three areas of joint knowledge production: defining common analytical or governance problems to be tackled through integration; establishing shared concepts (boundary objects); and establishing operational bridging devices (data and metrics, pathways evaluation and their delivery).

J	Ferrara, P				Ferrara, Pasquale			Sustainable International Relations. Pope Francis' Encyclical Laudato Si' and the Planetary Implications of "Integral Ecology"	RELIGIONS			English	Article						climate change and international relations; religion and the environment; Anthropocene; planetary justice; sustainability	CLIMATE-CHANGE; ENVIRONMENT; GOVERNANCE; SECURITY	This paper analyzes the theoretical and pragmatic implications for international relations and world politics of the new holistic approach to climate change articulated by Pope Francis in the Encyclical Laudato Si', particularly through the notion of "integral ecology". It is not my intention to offer an exegesis of the Papal document. I will rather try to illustrate and discuss its planetary hermeneutics. I emphasize that the Encyclical's perspective is not exclusively normative, and that, within the dynamic interplay between social structure and human agency, it can also be considered as a call to action. In this context, I suggest that both International Relations Theory and global politics have much to learn from the fundamental claims of contemporary religions in relation to climate disruption. In particular, Pope Francis' document, far from being just a new chapter in the unfolding process of the "greening" of religions, raises the issue of the sustainability of the present world system. Therefore, I contend that the perspective of the Encyclical calls for a radical transformation of international relations, since it emphasizes the deep implications of environmental issues on the entire spectrum of security, development, economic and ethical challenges of contemporary world politics. Against this backdrop, my objective is to connect the main tenets of the Encyclical to the environmental turn in International Relations Theory and to the new epistemological challenges related to the paradigm shift induced by the new planetary condition of the Anthropocene and the relevant questions arising for a justice encompassing the humanity-earth system. The Encyclical seems to suggest that practicing sustainable international relations means exiting the logic of power or hegemony, while simultaneously operationalizing the concept of care.

However, under the conditions of sustainability, both the perception of the real and financial spheres, as well as the relations between them, change. The aim of this article is to show that sustainable finance has an impact on building a sustainable economy, and the model of sustainable finance increases the degree of adjustment of the financial sphere to the real economy. The research was conducted based on 86 articles. The methodology is based on log-linear models. As a result, it was proved that sustainable enterprises and finances are the factors that most frequently interact with other variables describing a sustainable economy. The study proposes the financial model for sustainable economy, this is the main novelty and contribution of the study. The original contribution of the study includes: the comprehensive analysis of the factors and relationships between sustainability, economy and finance; building a triple layered finance model for sustainable economy taking into account governance, society and environment from sustainable perspective; proposing the model of financing for the circular economy in terms of sustainability in terms of the process and defining the model of sustainable finance 4.0.

This issue has the objective of reviewing the general trends and knowledge gaps and pinpointing new research topics. Several key aspects of public administration for development were discussed in the Symposium on Public Administration for Development: Trends and the Way Forward'. It was held at Fudan University in Shanghai in May-June 2014 to celebrate the 65th anniversary of the journal. This opening essay captures the global trends, setting out its implications for the search into alternative models of public administration and development, particularly reflecting on Asia. The forthcoming Post-2015 Development Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) promoted by the United Nations will pose major challenges as the public administrations are ill-prepared to deal with it. The seven essays themselves engage in key areas of unfinished businesses in setting a research agenda for debates in the future. The authors present a comprehensive, state of the art of the knowledge and the main debates in their areas of expertise. In doing so, they cover a wide range of topics that are relevant for practitioners, students and scholars interested in public administration in both transitional and developing countries.

The study explores how a destination can exhibit a hybrid mode of tourism governance, and also how that emerged in Hong Kong in relation to three phases of socioeconomic and tourism development. The three phases are 1842-1966, 1967-1997, and post-1997. Hong Kong's present mode of tourism governance combines pro-growth and pluralist elements. It is affected by the need for capital accumulation and political legitimacy and by the relative influence of government and civil society. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All, rights reserved.

The authors suggest that integrated watershed governance is more likely when different perspectives, including health and well-being, are explicitly understood, communicated, and sought as co-benefits of watershed management. A new conceptual device - the watershed governance prism - is introduced in relation to the multiple facets of governance that characterize contemporary water resources management and examined as an integrative framework to link social and environmental concerns with the determinants of health in the watershed context. The authors assess the diagnostic and communicative potential of such a framework, discussing its utility as a concise depiction of multiple, interacting policy priorities and as a guide to integrate different research and policy domains into the governance of water, health and social-ecological systems.

Empowering citizens in international governance of nanotechnologies	JOURNAL OF NANOPARTICLE RESEARCH			English	Article						Nanotechnology; International governance; Responsible research and innovation; Sustainability	EPISTEMIC COMMUNITIES	The international dialogue on responsible governance of nanotechnologies engages a wide range of actors with conflicting as well as common interests. It is also characterised by a lack of evidence-based data on uncertain risks of in particular engineered nanomaterials. The present paper aims at deepening understanding of the collective decision making context at international level using the grounded theory approach as proposed by Glaser and Strauss in "The Discovery of Grounded Theory'' (1967). This starts by discussing relevant concepts from different fields including sociological and political studies of international relations as well as political philosophy and ethics. This analysis of current trends in international law making is taken as starting point for exploring the role that a software decision support tool could play in multi-stakeholder global governance of nanotechnologies. These theoretical ideas are then compared with the current design of the SUN Decision Support System (SUNDS) under development in the European project on Sustainable Nanotechnologies (SUN, www.sun-fp7.eu). Through constant comparison, the ideas are also compared with requirements of different stakeholders as expressed during a user workshop. This allows for highlighting discussion points for further consideration.

The information disclosed in this regard is essential to know and monitor business contribution to the 2030 Agenda. In this paper, we analyze the influence that institutional investors have on the adoption of the disclosure strategy established by UN and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)-GRI-SDG Compass. The results obtained for a sample of 989 international companies, which prepare their sustainability reports following the GRI guidelines, show that ownership by foreign investors, pension funds, and "other" investors boosts the relevance of the information disclosed in relation to the 2030 Agenda. On the contrary, government, financial institutions, and cross holdings have no impact on the information systems developed.

In this paper, several interventions that form the basis of some present and future Palestinian developmental and planning dilemmas are tackled. Among the challenges the Palestinian people facing are natural disasters. Such disasters have caused enormous losses and have set back economic progress in developed and undeveloped countries alike. On the Palestinian arena, the water shortages, the environmental degradation, and the land and natural resources' depletion, which all go hand in hand with the political conflict in the Middle East, are perceived to be the most significant anthropogenic disasters currently affecting the Palestinian people in the OPT. In addition, natural disasters are significantly considered a potential threat to the OPT's population. Earthquakes in the region are considered a major hazard, with low probability but high adverse impacts. Adding to this, the proposed Red Sea-Dead Sea Conveyance that will bring about two billion cubic meter of saline water from the Red Sea to the Dead Sea will be potentially, if constructed, a huge source of induced earthquakes. Moreover, the future looks not so promising; due to the rapid population growth and the way the cities are developing in the OPT, as more than 50% of the Palestinian population lives in what is defined as "hazard-prone" areas. These areas are particularly vulnerable, because of their dependence on complex infrastructures. Moreover, the lack of knowledgeable professionals and technical capabilities in the OPT, in regard to disaster-sound management, is another reason for the current chaotic situation.

J	Wells, T; Lamb, V				Wells, Tamas; Lamb, Vanessa			The imaginary of a moderncity: Post-politics and Myanmar's urban development	URBAN STUDIES			English	Article						development; governance; infrastructure; Myanmar; politics	DEPOLITICISATION; GOVERNANCE	Theories of 'post-politics' provide a lens through which to analyse contemporary urban development. Yet empirical studies examining this 'age of post-politics' are few, especially outside of Europe and North America. This article examines the promise and limits of notions of post-politics through the case of planning for New Yangon City, a multi-billion dollar urban development in Myanmar (Burma). While the 2021 military coup has now made the future of the project uncertain, our research conducted in 2019 revealed similar dynamics at play to those described more broadly in the literature on post-politics. We highlight familiar processes of delegation of decision-making, a proliferation of governance actors and an individualisation of policy issues. What is distinctive in Myanmar is the way a coalition of elite decision-makers have diluted and defused policy disagreements through the construction of a utopian vision of a modern international city. We see this imaginary of the modern city as a tactic to support the broader efforts of depoliticisation. This diverges from arguments that the imagination of social change is curtailed through the pragmatic post-political notion that 'there is no alternative'. Instead, in the context of New Yangon City, utopian vision is integral to depoliticisation and limiting dissent. We conclude that attention to processes of depoliticisation is crucial in relation to mega project planning in Asia, and that a productive way forward for studies of urban development is not wholesale acceptance or dismissal of the notion of post-politics, but robust engagement with its critiques and promise.

J	Ensor, J; Hoddy, E				Ensor, Jonathan; Hoddy, Eric			Securing the social foundation: A rights-based approach to planetary boundaries	EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE			English	Article						Human rights; Development; Environmental governance; Sustainability	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; META-GOVERNANCE; SCIENCE; SAFE; CONFLICTS; SPACE; EARTH	The 'planetary boundaries' framework identifies Earth system processes that contribute to the stability and resilience of the planet (Rockstr_om et al., 2009a), setting out the limits to changes the Earth can support for remaining in a Holocene-like state. A key question for global sustainable development that emerges from this framework is how to secure social equity while respecting planetary boundaries. Recent efforts to quantify a 'social foundation' have drawn attention to the necessity of securing human wellbeing in a 'safe and just operating space'. Yet realising the potential of this approach, we suggest, requires addressing two substantial governance challenges: how do we define and analyse success or failure in the integration of social equity in environmental governance systems?; and how do we support the emergence of those voices that are needed to make governance equitable? We argue that human rights offer a widely accepted normative basis for responding to both these questions. The body of rightsbased practice offers an analytical framing and tools for development support at a time when there is an urgent need to engage with the structural problems in environmental governance. Through a rightsbased approach, it becomes possible to identify and address the social relations and mechanisms that generate inequities, and which undermine progress in addressing the unsustainable use of planetary resources at multiple scales. A decade after the planetary boundaries framework first appeared, widespread exploration of the potential of a rights-based approach is overdue. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

G.; Gibbs, David			From sustainable development to carbon control: eco-state restructuring and the politics of urban and regional development	TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF BRITISH GEOGRAPHERS			English	Article						climate policy; territorial carbon management; urban and regional development; environmental regulation	ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMIC-GEOGRAPHY; ANTHROPOGENIC CLIMATE-CHANGE; ECOLOGICAL MODERNIZATION; NEOLIBERALISING NATURE; UNITED-STATES; CITY-REGIONS; GOVERNANCE; POLICY; SCALE; COMMODIFICATION	The management of carbon emissions holds some prospect for challenging sustainable development as the organising principle of socio-environmental regulation. This paper explores the rise of a distinctive low-carbon polity as an ideological state project, and examines its potential ramifications for the regulation of economy-environment relations at the urban and regional scale. Carbon control would seem to introduce a new set of values into state regulation and this might open up possibilities for challenging mainstream modes of urban and regional development in a manner not possible under sustainable development. But low-carbon restructuring also portends intensified uneven development, new forms of state control and a socially uneven reworking of state-society relations. In order to explore these issues we start by setting out a framework for conceptualising environmental regulation based around the idea of eco-state restructuring. This idea is introduced to capture the conflicts, power struggles and strategic selectivities involved as governments seek to reconcile environmental protection with multiple other pressures and demands. Overall the paper seeks to make a distinctive contribution to theoretical work on state environmental regulation and the emerging spatial dimensions of climate policy.

For the same purpose, this study aims to analyse and measure penetration level of information and communication technology (ICT) applications across ten select gross domestic product-dependent sectors (gross domestic product - GDP) in Indian economy. Design/methodology/approach - Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach of PROMETHEE, using its partial and complete versions in fuzzy environment, is applied. The approach assesses e-governance efficacy in various sectors, which is chosen based on their contribution to GDP, where criteria values are assigned by expert opinions, feedback is received and lessons are learnt from training and initiatives taken under the Digital India programme launched by the Government of India. These criteria related to IT policy implementation, cyber security breaches, IT infrastructure development initiatives in select sectors are identified. Later, sectors outranking results have been highlighted using both fuzzy set theory along with PROMETHEE (F-PROMETHEE) and its visual application. Findings - On applying F-PROMETHEE, studies found that industrial, railways, health and finance and education sectors outrank in their high merit orders. Contrary, outranking shows that agriculture, defence and aerospace sectors should be more open and accessible to adopt ICT applications in order to promote e-governance processes and their implementation to make e-services available to common citizens. For better interpretation of results, graphical analysis for interactive aid is used to present the analyses. Research limitations/implications - Research study was found useful in the assessment of ICT penetration level in to support Indo-EU relations, where PROMETHEE method is used to outrank sectors alternatives. Criteria are also weighted using fuzzy scale, and the impact of criteria on all alternatives has also been assessed. MCDMframework addresses that subjectivity lies in sectors to implement ICTs bases services. However, few other MCDM frameworks, methods such as COPRAS, GST, GRA, SAW and SWARA, can be used for the same purpose. Practical implications - Sectors alternative involve high degree of complexity to adopt ICT applications for smooth e-governance and seek effective decision-making for investment prioritization and future development. This study also aims to address cyber security concerns of policymakers. Outranking methods of F-PROMETHEE are able to address the criteria-to-criteria impact and support decision-making in a more precise way. Social implications - This study is inspired from the strategic implementation of the framework of the e-Government Action Plan 2016-2020 of the EU. The findings from the paper can provide referential support to the Indian Government and policymakers to support information delivery, implement cyber security policies and various sector developments. Originality/value - This research study can act as a strong base in the decision-making process in conflicting situations of e-governance in India. This study not only can synergize conflicting ideas of various stakeholders, academicians in the Indian IT-sector but also can act as support to administrators and the policymakers to monitor the status of the India-EU Information Society Dialogue.

These impacts have also reached public administration, including its governance. Digital technologies' rise has paved the way for the surfacing of a new public governance model called the Digital Era Governance (DEG) model (often referred to as e-government, digital government, e-governance, or digital governance) in which digital technologies play a central role. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive and in-depth examination of DEG research over the past two decades. Bibliometric analysis is based on the Scopus database that contains 9175 documents published between 2001 and 2020. In this context, several established and innovative bibliometric approaches are applied. The results reveal the growth of DEG research over the last two decades, especially in recent years, as accelerated by several of the most relevant documents published in reputable journals such as Government Information Quarterly. Most DEG research has been conducted in Anglo-Saxon countries, as confirmed while examining the most relevant authors' affiliations and collaborations. The results also indicate that DEG has advanced from conventional public services to citizen-oriented e-services by including citizens' participation and, most recently, even to smart services by facilitating emerging and disruptive technologies. The findings add to the stock of scientific knowledge and support the evidence-based policymaking needed to successfully pursue a sustainable future.

Therefore, the protected areas are under a management scheme carried out by the central government that limits the participation of other social actors and the sustainable use of resources in these territories. pa in Mexico are no exception, they are under a governance scheme in which the state stands as the central actor. Thus, this actor is responsible for regulating the access to and the use of these ecosystems that are of interest to multiple social actors. In this context, the objective is to propose some theoretical-methodological tools for understanding of the structure of social relations in the Mexican pa. This action is the basis for the design of planned interventions aimed at the development of environmental governance. For this paper, the theoretical perspective of social capital (SC) with emphasis on structural SC was used. This proposal has a broad capacity to explain the horizontal and vertical links in the whole structure of relationships. It allows the understanding of environmental governance as a multiactoral socio-organizational process.

However, the categorical apparatus as presented at the above mentioned events is not always used correctly and the same is true about the objective interpretation of the very nature of the processes. Also the explanations of realistic options of governance to mitigate and streamline the effects associated with climate variability in order to achieve the least possible damage of global environment are not always given appropriately. Because of a lack of specific statistical data on climate variability, which are usually at the sole disposal of professional climate scientists, and owing to the attention the public pays to these phenomena only at times of climatic anomalies (floods, extreme heat and drought, etc.), the issue is still on the edge of a broader awareness of people and academic research. This paper is in essence an overview of scientific works, which aims to contribute to the understanding of the issue of climate change by the means of summarizing the main approaches and use of categories, defining their substance and especially clarifying the phenomena in relation to possibilities of global governance.

J	Langford, NJ; Fransen, L				Langford, Natalie J.; Fransen, Luc			Building Legitimacy in an Era of Polycentric Trade: The Case of Transnational Sustainability Governance	POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE			English	Article						governance; legitimacy; polycentric trade; production; sustainability; tea; transnational standards; Trustea	VALUE CHAINS; POLITICS; STANDARDS; RISE	Increasing multi-polarity within global politics is understood to be a key contributor to the current legitimacy crisis facing global governance organisations. International relations scholars studying this crisis recognise that a prominent strategy to confront ???Northern??? dominance within this arena is through the construction of alternative governance institutions. Yet while the de-legitimation of long-established international organisations is widely discussed, there is less focused atten-tion on how alternative institutions seek to gain legitimacy, particularly when they advance in fields where both ???Northern??? and ???Southern??? interests matter and beliefs about what constitutes proper governance may differ. This article analyses the field of transnational economic governance where the de-legitimation of pre-existing Northern-oriented governance takes the shape of new initiatives backed by Southern actors. Specifically, we focus on transnational sustainability stan-dards governing trade and production in the global economy. This global governance arena has been transformed by the increasingly polycentric nature of global trade, in which producers governed by sustainability standards cater to rapidly expanding markets in the Global South as well as markets in the Global North. As markets have expanded in emerging economies, transnational sustainability standards must increasingly navigate and respond to actors and interests within different geographies in order to gain and establish legitimacy. The recent development of Southern-oriented sustainabil-ity standards (as opposed to established Northern-led standards) reflects the existence of diverging perspectives on the appropriateness of established rules and procedures when it comes to the regulation of trade and production. These stan-dards are seen as partially challenging established standards but may likely seek to establish legitimacy within the wider transnational field of sustainability governance. This article examines the case of a recently established India-based sus-tainability standard known as Trustea to illustrate how various actors managed design and policy dilemmas to reconcile the preferences and beliefs of various audiences. The case illustrates the significance of both ???Northern??? and ???Southern??? audiences to Trustea???s legitimacy-seeking strategies in the context of broader political contestations regarding how pro-duction should be governed in relation to sustainable practices.

In this research, we aimed to make a significant contribution to the literature by tracing the EC trajectory and policy transitions. Through bibliometric analysis of policy documents, we reviewed the EC construction system for Fujian Province from 2004 to 2020. The policy priorities, organization-functional network, and contributing factors to policy changes in each of the three phases are discussed in depth. Target setting, actors' functions, and institutional guarantees are the core elements of EC construction. This research provides a quantitative foundation for understanding policy reform and transition with regards to Chinese local governments' EC actions. The experience of Fujian Province shows trends toward legalization, multi-actor linkage, and issue refinement that may serve as a basis for other countries and regions in order to explore the promotion of sustainable development and environmental governance as pathways to EC.

J	Musavengane, R; Siakwah, P; Leonard, L				Musavengane, Regis; Siakwah, Pius; Leonard, Llewellyn			The nexus between tourism and urban risk: Towards inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable outdoor tourism in African cities	JOURNAL OF OUTDOOR RECREATION AND TOURISM-RESEARCH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Urban tourism; Urban risk; Sustainable cities; Inclusive tourism; Safe destination; Africa	STREET VENDORS; SOUTH; GOVERNANCE; MANAGEMENT; RESOURCES; COUNTRIES; SOCIETY; POVERTY; QUALITY; POLICY	Sub-Saharan Africa is set to increase its tourism sector in urban areas. However, its cities are also settings for numerous struggles over future developments coupled with excess urban risks. The nexus created by the relationship between urbanization, urban growth, urban governance, poverty and inequality, and ecological degradation is altering the sustainability of urban tourism in Sub-Saharan African cities. Inspired by the United Nations' 2030 Sustainable Development Goal 11; making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable, this study critically analyses the linkages between risk, justice, inclusion, trust and power relations in urban spaces with the aim to strengthen tourism governance in Sub-Saharan African urban settings. Document analysis is adopted to draw evidence and critically analyse the sustainability of tourism in the three Sub-Saharan cities: Accra, Ghana; Johannesburg, South Africa; and Harare, Zimbabwe. The study reveals that tourism development in Africa is dominantly underpinned by neoliberal development strategies which threaten the sustainability of tourism in African cities. It, therefore, argues for good governance through strong sustainability institutions which strengthen the regulative mechanisms, processes and organizational culture which empowers local communities. Sustainable tourism approaches that are resilient centred have a potential to promote urban tourism in Sub-Saharan African cities.

J	Ihugba, BU				Ihugba, Bethel Uzoma			An Examination of the Good Governance Legal Framework of Nigeria Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (NEITI) Act 2007	LAW AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW			English	Article						accountability; extractive industry; good governance; natural resource governance; Nigeria; transparency		Transparency and accountability are key concepts of good governance that are repeatedly demonstrated to have the capacity to translate natural resources wealth to sustainable development of economies. These concepts are particularly important to countries rich in natural resources and Nigeria is one of such countries. Evidence however suggests that Nigeria is not benefiting from the gains expected from its natural resources despite policies and legislations like the NEITI Act 2007 which are aimed at promoting sustainable development through transparency and accountability. Various attempts at theorizing the reasons behind these apparent failures have tended to blame external factors. These external factors are sometimes disguised under the omnibus descriptions of resource curse phenomenon and corruption. This paper argues that although these factors may be contributing to the continued failures of several development initiatives, there may be need to ensure that the legal frameworks and instruments developed to achieve these objectives are not in themselves faulty. The article posits that the internal normative incoherence in some of these laws creates the room for continued failures despite the best of intentions and interests. To demonstrate this argument, the paper through normative analysis, examines the NEITI Act 2007 in relation to its key transparency and accountability provisions.

Among various models of shared governance of protected areas, co-management is a potentially innovative approach for addressing past injustices and meeting the Sustainable Development Goals through socio-economic redress, upliftment, and conservation, although there is mixed evidence of success. In establishing new governance arrangements, shifts in power between the state and new rightsholders can undermine good governance unless power dynamics are explicitly ackowledged. A case-study approach is used to describe and reflect on the transformative co-learning journey followed by land-reform beneficiaries and government partners at Lekgalameetse Nature Reserve in South Africa. Co-management was an entirely new practice unknown to both parties, and so co-learning was key. Recognising the need to support learning and adaptability, a strongly systemic, social learning approach was followed. The co-management support process covered all the aspects of governance quality. Equitable governance was promoted by enhancing the legitimacy and voice of the land-owner communities. Fairness and rights were promoted through legal support and co-developed principles used to guide the governance of benefits and park development; both highly contested issues that revealed hidden agendas. Thework on equity laid the foundation for more effective governance, through a collaboratively developed vision and detailed understanding of roles and responsibilities needed to facilitate better performance and accountability. However, guidance on dealing with hidden agendas underlying power relations was identified as a critical gap. In concluding, the case study points to the importance of paying attention to power dynamics in development work. Secondly, the work emphasises that, within a land-reform context, co-management requires a shift from a contractual process to one that is socially and politically embedded and that is transformative. As such it has an important role to play in developing agency, dignity and respect whilst also contributing to people's livelihoods. Doing this means committing resources and capacities to the co-learning journey. Without appropriate support for both parties, and an orientation towards co-learning for new, largely uncharted governance arrangements, the co-management endeavour, and hence long-term sustainable development, will remain deeply fragile.

J	Saarinen, J				Saarinen, Jarkko			Enclavic tourism spaces: territorialization and bordering in tourism destination development and planning	TOURISM GEOGRAPHIES			English	Article						Enclave tourism; borders; borderwork; development; inequality; community; host-guest relations; globalization; governance	BACKPACKER; GEOGRAPHY; IMPACTS; GROWTH; PLACE	Enclave tourism is a growing field of research. In general, tourism enclaves are seen as products of global capitalism and a non-locally-driven neoliberal market economy. Enclaves also manifest certain kinds of tourism planning and development modes in destination societies. The enclaves are exclusively planned spaces that usually contain the vast majority of facilities and services needed for tourists who have limited possibilities or desire to leave the enclave. At the same time, the locals' access to these spaces can be limited or otherwise controlled. Therefore, there are always power issues and processes of inequalities and uneven development involved, which calls for a further understanding of enclaves and their evolution and governance in tourism planning and development. This paper aims to discuss and synthesize the conceptual idea of enclaves in tourism and get an overview of some of the key theoretical perspectives on how enclavic spaces are produced, bordered, and governed in contemporary tourism planning and development. It is concluded that in critical situations the enclave tourism spaces with all-inclusive products can turn out to be all-exclusive for local communities in development. To understand the nature and development of enclave tourism and to guide their transformation in more sustainable directions, further research on policy and governance aspects of enclave tourism is needed.

Because this sector has a strong influence economically and on sustainable development, both risk management issues and stakeholder pressure drive the financial sector into a more sustainable direction. In contrast to polluting sectors, the financial sector does not affect the environment and society by direct emissions or the use of resources like other industries. To compare the financial sector with other sectors regarding their sustainability performance, we analyzed the performance in the fields of sustainability reporting, business ethics and product responsibility, labor issues, environmental performance, community issues, and corporate governance. The study is based on more than 1800 firms including 400 organizations from the financial sector. We link CSR to sustainability and define it as corporate self-regulation in order to manage sustainability risks and opportunities. The results suggest that financial sector performance is relatively low regarding corporate social responsibility (CSR) in general. Weaknesses of the financial sector with regard to CSR are reporting, business ethics and product responsibility, and labor issues. Strengths of the financial sector regarding CSR can be located with respect to community relations. Further research is needed with respect to the factors influencing CSR performance. It is still not clear what influences regulations, stakeholder pressure or potential financial benefits have on sustainability performance in the financial sector.

J	Jitmaneeroj, B				Jitmaneeroj, Boonlert			Reform priorities for corporate sustainability Environmental, social, governance, or economic performance?	MANAGEMENT DECISION			English	Article						Sustainable development; Sustainability; Corporate social responsibility; Policy reforms; Reform priorities	COMPETITIVENESS	Purpose - Most companies rarely work on sustainable development as a whole, which includes environmental, social, governance, and economic pillars. The purpose of this paper is to explore causal relationships between pillar scores and overall score of sustainability and identify the most critical pillar to which policy makers should allot limited resources with the highest priority. Design/methodology/approach - Based on Thomson Reuters ASSET4 database of global corporate sustainability, this paper examines the causal relations between pillar scores and overall score of sustainability by using the three-stage integrative methodology consisting of cluster analysis, data mining, and partial least square path modeling. Findings - This paper finds that each pillar has unequal effects on the overall corporate sustainability and that the overall score is affected by not only the direct effects from pillar scores but also the indirect effects from the causal interrelations among pillars. Moreover, the patterns of causal directions and the most critical pillar are sensitive to industries. Social performance is the most critical pillar for the majority of industries, followed by environmental performance, and economic performance, respectively. The governance performance, however, is not the most critical pillar in any industry. Practical implications - To construct a roadmap for reform priorities, policy makers should follow the top-down approach which involves hierarchical decisions. Using the three-stage methodology, the policy makers first decide on the most critical pillar score before selecting the most critical category score underneath. Originality/value - Relaxing traditional assumptions of simple average overall score of corporate sustainability, the three-stage integrative framework allows for causal interrelations among pillars and different weights on individual pillars.

However, there is a need for more sector-specific research to integrate findings on the spatiality of social innovation, co-operative processes, and place-scale relations. This article presents a review (2002-2018) of social innovation in urban spaces. Based on data from 114 publications, the review indicates that research in the spatiality of social innovation can be grouped into three major themes: (1) Spatial planning and community development; (2) Governance; (3) Co-production and service design. The findings suggest that in general the collaboration of end users in place-based development is central to this process of urban change and that process is as significant as the outcome. This article concludes with a research agenda to address identified lacunas.

This paper presents a framework for the integrated management of the WEF nexus, which brings together four separate models that address the less well-examined socio-anthropological aspects of the nexus. The proposed framework provides insight into the human element as part of the wider ecosystem in terms of socio-cultural and economic activities, the laws and policies that govern these activities, as well as their potential socio-economic impacts and consequences. This paper outlines each individual model, before going on to present a conceptual framework for the integration of the various models for the purpose of supporting more robust decision-making. The framework, which is grounded in systems thinking, adopts the principles of sustainable development as structural foci in order to position the various models in relation to one another; harmonizing their inputs as well as outputs.

We provide a comparative analysis of eight landscape-level MSPs spanning seven countries (Peru, Brazil, India, Tanzania, Ethiopia, and a cross-border case from Kenya and Somalia), representing a diversity of resource systems covering forests, rangelands, and multiuse agricultural landscapes. Applying an adapted social-ecological systems framework, our synthesis identifies the influence of these MSPs on patterns of stakeholder interaction and draws implications for the design and organization of MSPs that are both appropriate and effective. From the cases, we distill lessons addressing: (1) how to design an MSP in relation to the governance context, including the fit between institutional and ecological dimensions of the system and with attention to cross-scale linkages; (2) how to implement inclusive processes that address power inequities, including through capacity building and procedural rules; and (3) how to support adaptive learning to expand the MSP's influence over time, including monitoring outcomes, adapting the scope of stakeholder engagement, and investing in MSP durability.

J	Devenin, V				Devenin, Veronica			Collaborative community development in mining regions: The Calama Plus and Creo Antofagasta programs in Chile	RESOURCES POLICY			English	Article						Corporate community development; Collaborative governance; Stakeholder management; Cumulative impact assessment; Sustainable local development	SOCIAL LICENSE; SUSTAINABILITY; PERSPECTIVES; INVESTMENT; GOVERNANCE; EXTRACTION; BUSINESS; DESIGN	The mining industry is widely criticized for its corporate community development strategies, which led to accusations of greenwash and low social legitimacy. This problem identified led to the following research question: What model of community relations allows companies to generate shared value, in a broad sense, and create long-term relationships with communities? In order to answer the question posed, this paper explores the innovative experiences of the Calama Plus and Creo Antofagasta programs in the Antofagasta region of Chile. Calama Plus is an ongoing public-private program (2012-2025) established to combat declining standards of living in the city. Creo Antofagasta is also an ongoing public-private program (2013-2035), which is designed to confront the challenges of rapid growth in the city. Based on these two case studies, their underlying model (i.e., the collaborative community development model) was systematized for this study. The main innovative aspects of the model are its focus on the long-term, its concentration on territory- oriented projects, and its multi-stakeholder governance structure. The latter characteristic implies a collaboration between several companies and even between competitors. Drawing on a collaborative governance framework, the aim of this paper is to extensively describe the companies' perspective on the following: the innovative aspects of the model, the drivers required for companies to participate, how companies can specifically contribute to these programs, and its critical management issues. New drivers and critical management issues are identified and discussed in this research, which represent a contribution to the collaborative governance framework. Since the Calama Plus and Creo Antofagasta programs' focus is long-term, ending in 2025 and 2035 respectively, their impact has not been evaluated. For this reason, we include a discussion on the cumulative impact assessment perspective needed for these collaborative community development programs, placing particular attention on the controversial relationship between mining and local development. This approach is based on the assessment of cross-sector partnership results, its impact on the balance of social, environmental and economic capitals, and on the creation of broadly shared value in terms of long-term socio-economic capability building. Finally, policy implications and the potential for applying this model to other contexts are also discussed.

J	Saintier, S				Saintier, Severine			Community Energy Companies in the UK: A Potential Model for Sustainable Development in "Local" Energy?	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						energy transition; renewable energy sources; energy poverty; community interest companies; the United Kingdom; social justice; sharing economy; regulation; governance	RENEWABLE ENERGY; JUSTICE; GOVERNANCE; POLICY	The rise of renewable energy sources (RES) comes with a shift in attention from government and market energy governance to local community initiatives and self-regulation. Although this shift is generally welcome at domestic and EU level, the regulatory dimension, at both levels, is nevertheless not adapted to this multi-actor market since prosumers are not empowered and energy justice is far from achieved. The rise, in the UK, of Community Interest Companies (consumers and local actors' collectives) in the energy sector provides an interesting perspective as it allows a whole system's view. Research was conducted with six energy community organizations in the South West of England in order to evaluate their role and identity and assess whether this exemplar of "the rise of a social sphere in regulation" could be used as a model for a more sustainable social approach to the governance of economic relations. Findings illustrate that such organizations undoubtedly play an important role in the renewable energy sector and they also help to alleviate some aspects of "energy injustice". Yet, the failure to recognize, in terms of energy policy, at domestic and EU level, the importance of such actors undermines their role. The need to embed and support such organizations in policy is necessary if one is to succeed to put justice at the core of the changing energy landscape.

Land use, environmental change, and sustainable development: the role of institutional diagnostics	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS			English	Article						Bottom-up strategies; common property; governance; institutional diagnostics; normative; private property; public property; regulatory; the "tragedy of the commons"; institutions; top-down strategies		Although the "tragedy of the commons" is common currency in popular accounts of problems arising in human-environment relations, empirical research has shown that common-property systems do not always lead to tragic outcomes. Moreover, systems of private property or public property, often proposed as solutions to the tragedy of the commons, can generate tragedies of their own that are equally severe. The challenge we face is to develop strategies for avoiding these tragedies featuring structures of property rights that are most likely to lead to sustainable outcomes in specific situations ranging from local communities reliant on the harvest of renewable resources to the global system facing the prospect of climate change. Successful governance systems typically involve regulatory, top-down strategies, normative, bottom-up strategies, or some combination of the two. What is needed to achieve sustainable results is a-diagnostic approach that matches institutions to specific biophysical and socioeconomic conditions in contrast to an ideological approach that advocates the application of one system of property rights to all situations.

On the one hand, various incidents have occurred since 1970s that have caused tensions among the riparian states. On the other hand, however, the crises and deadlocks in the hydropolitical relations of the co-riparians have also paved the way for various cooperation efforts and initiatives regarding the utilization of the Euphrates-Tigris waters. This study analyzes those efforts and initiatives, as well as various aspects of sustainable water resource management and governance practices that can act as tools for preventing future disputes among the co-riparians in the future.

J	Auer, MR				Auer, MR			Who participates in global environmental governance? Partial answers from international relations theory	POLICY SCIENCES			English	Article								An important current of research in international environmental affairs deals with the roles of non-state actors in international environmental governance. For many, the growing influence of non-state actors is a welcome trend because these actors, especially non-governmental organizations, facilitate environmental negotiations between states and perform key information-gathering, dissemination, advocacy, and appraisal functions that states are either unwilling or unable to do. For the student of international relations (IR), examining the roles and responsibilities of non-state actors in global environmental affairs is a departure from the ordinary concern of that field - namely, the study of interstate behavior. But for the study of global environmental problems, particularly those problems that are simultaneously global and local, the investigator must map the influence of an even broader assemblage of actors. Little is known about how local level institutions or ordinary citizens fit into global environmental policy processes. Understanding what motivates public demands for global environmental quality is an especially important research task, especially for those pervasive environmental problems like global climate change and complex exhortations like sustainable development that require the attention and acquiescence of ordinary citizens.

Neither the adoption of the National Strategy for Climate Adaptation has led to implement a national policy. This is why the governance of climate change varies across regions depending on the environmental sensitivity, and attitudes by local institutions, the kind of activism by public administrators, their power or fragility, and the abilities in drawing from EU funds. This chapter points out that bringing climate to the center calls for multilevel governance not only by means of technical and political abilities, but also by sharing climate responsive narratives, and actions with people. This allows exploring climate effects on local contexts and even adding creativity to the governance model. Naples cannot consider climate change as a priority due to the perception of more urgent problems to be solved. Accordingly, the chapter discusses how narratives of climate change work for both the ongoing new urban plan and strategic metropolitan plan by promoting shared processes of socio-ecological regeneration. The chapter argues that the only way to put global environmental challenges into fragile cities' agendas is to assume climate change as an opportunity to radically rethink social, ecological, and economic relations.

This article shows how the Arena of Development and policy mix approaches may inform the analysis of system transition to a low carbon society. The Arena of Development approach is an actor-centred approach that focuses on how path dependencies of socio-technical systems may be challenged when controversies and matters-of-concern produce 'arenas' where established governance configurations and policies of a socio-technical system are challenged. Re-organising actor-constellations are constitutional for arenas and define their boundaries and the policies employed. We discuss the historic transitions in relation to four focal areas of Danish attempts to become independent of fossil energy: wind-power integration in the energy system, energy savings, biomass and sustainable mobility. The analysis demonstrates the conflicts and mixes of policy measures that have moved transition processes forward, but sometimes also stalling them. The analysis shows how changing controversies, arena configurations and policy mixes move forward the energy transition process.

The four approaches, namely: resource-exploitive, resource-conservationist, resource-preservationist and extreme preservationist are considered from anthropocentric and ecocentric points of view in terms of leadership ethics and economic cogency. Ethical aspects of declining environmental resources are analyzed in relation to conceptions of 'hard' sustainability embracing intergenerational equity and the constant natural assets rule in addition the more conventional business criteria of environmental, social and economic triple bottom line. Ethical issues are considered in conjunction with their likely economic effects on corporate and environmental sustainability, by analyzing different types of ecocentric and anthropocentric approaches to natural resource utilization. The paper suggests that immoral (preconventional) leadership is associated with natural resource exploitation, amoral/pragmatically moral (conventional) leadership associated with 'balanced' natural resource conservation, while principled, moral (post conventional) leadership is associated with natural resource preservation, often at the cost of human capital development. Leadership associated with natural resource exploitation and preservation is fundamentally inimical to balanced natural resource utilization and 'strong' (intergenerational) corporate sustainability.

In this article we will present a theoretical approach for the analysis of these relations in their context within governance organisations in the European Union. The article supports the assumption that culture is an important factor when various communities (professional, institutional, regional, disciplinary) interact in EU-stimulated governance initiatives. These diverse cultural identities within the various groups have a large part to play in the rejection or invention of new repertoires of action. Little is known about the effect of European governance on the variety of local or regional governance practices, embedded in various national, institutional, professional cultures. Does EU-stimulated exchange between regions restrict or even eliminate repertoire, or does it favour innovation and increase variety? This crucial issue needs thorough further study. We will explore the complexity of European governance, using system theories and accountability within a social constructivist paradigm to explicate the interaction between actors, project-communities and societal structures on different policy and regional levels. Empirical data will be retrieved from the INTERREG practice, because this EU framework of programmes is based on both horizontal (between policy levels on the same level of hierarchy) and vertical policy interaction (along the axis of hierarchy between EC and local policy) with the explicit aim of stimulating regional development and innovation. As a nested case study (case within a case) we will use two INTERREG projects showing mechanisms of both closure and openness. One case deals with a project involved in the management of historical fortifications. This case study is an example of closed institutional cultures. We briefly touch on the second case study which shows cognitive openness in a network. Conclusions will be drawn regarding the role of culture in governance innovation, and the steps that are deemed necessary to improve our knowledge in this field.

The greatest awareness about questions linked to fishery resource sustainability - such as the need to arbitrate acts designed to regulate fishery access conditions; the application of different business strategies and conflicts among both national and international jurisdictions (high sea and transzonal areas). That is why the need of implementing new enhancements regarding behavior codes applied by producers, as well as regarding the decisions adopted by public authorities within the framework of fishery regulation, in the context of a Global Sustainable Development. The main objective of this work is reviewing the successive policies related to the management of the fishery resources, as well as to determine the key elements of the governance, in relation to the behavior of the actors involved in this activity. Fisheries management is also taken into consideration from the institutional level and from the actors involved. The information analyzed was obtained from an extensive review of the academic literature and through interviews with companies and personalities related to the fishing activity. As a conclusion, some measures are proposed to promote a better organizational functioning of the sector, eliminating the existing dysfunctional ones and reconciling conflicting interests. These measures suggest incorporating dimensions from ecosystems, socio-economic systems and institutional aspects. We conclude that management systems should be institutional agreements and administrative processes with the capacity to articulate a fisheries policy.

ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						Sustainable development goals; Sustainability indicators; Composite index; Measuring progress; European Union; Ranking	COMPOSITE INDICATORS; TRADE-OFFS; COUNTRIES; SDGS; CLASSIFICATION; CHALLENGES; GOVERNANCE; RANKING; INDEXES	Since the adoption of the United Nation's 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, attempts to monitor their status of achievement are increasing by governments, the academic community and non-governmental actors. Particular focus is thereby put on constructing composite indices that allow benchmarking of countries according to their level of SDG achievement. Throughout the different rankings that exist, countries from northern Europe appear to be most advanced regarding SDG implementation. However, this picture is biased as these rankings typically refer to the relative position of countries in relation to all other countries included in the index at a certain point in time. Tracking countries' absolute progress over time towards the SDGs on the basis of such indices can therefore be misleading. The present paper proposes a new progress measure based on the Eurostat method for measuring progress towards the SDGs over time. Applying this measure to the EU Member States on the basis of the official EU SDG indicator set, we show that countries labelled as "SD leaders" hardly make further progress towards the SDGs, while strong movement towards the goals is visible in southern and eastern European countries that score rather low in existing indices. This new perspective suggests that to actually monitor progress towards achieving the SDGs, existing SDG indices should be complemented with a longitudinal perspective to assess development over time towards or away from the 2030 Agenda's objectives.

Based on the understanding that enabling desired socio-economic relations between individuals forms the core of the governance of sharing activities, this paper develops a conceptual framework which shows how governance practices for sharing vary in terms of the weight given to social bonding development and economic transaction facilitation. Drawing on literature from management, marketing, economics and sociology as well as empirical studies on the sharing economy, this paper identifies the governance practices to which sharing economy organizations resort to different degrees and in different ways to structure their sharing activities. Potential contradictions and complementarities between governance practices are specified as they can be an important source shaping the specific governance mix of sharing economy organizations. The proposed framework contributes to a fine-grained understanding of the complexity of governance in the sharing economy, it highlights the relevance of the interplay between the social and economic governance practices, and it lays the foundation to empirically capture the governance mix of sharing economy organizations.

Power and knowledge asymmetries in Cape Town, South Africa	GEOFORUM			English	Article						Urban infrastructure; Power asymmetry; Knowledge asymmetry; Participation; Governance; Service delivery; Energy governance	CITIES; PARTY; CITIZENSHIP; POLITICS; INFORMATION; POLICY	Despite widespread scholarly recognition that infrastructure delivery and consumption is as much a sociopolitical process as a technical-material product, global development agendas (e.g. United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals) continue to prioritise the universal provision of public infrastructure as a static transfer of physical goods/services without explicit recognition of their socio-political dimensions. This paper explores the everyday ways in which citizens negotiate public infrastructure delivery and access, situated in a global South context of extreme inequality and limited state capacity. Using a case study of two low-income settlements in Cape Town with differing infrastructure provision, we demonstrate how governance processes can undermine the physical delivery of infrastructure. While participatory governance remains a core policy mechanism to democratise service delivery, in practice the capacity of citizens to participate is affected by power and knowledge asymmetries that function both within and between communities and the state. These asymmetric power relations and knowledge flows contribute to clientelistic politics that not only limit citizen engagement in participatory governance, but actively undermine low-income urban dwellers' access to services that have been physically delivered and targeted to meet their needs. Framed by a case study of energy interventions, we conclude that widening access to public infrastructure requires significant investment in effective governance processes for low-income urban dwellers.

Learning in Support of Governance: Theories, Methods, and a Framework to Assess How Bridging Organizations Contribute to Adaptive Resource Governance	ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY			English	Article						adaptive governance; bridging organizations; knowledge utilization; learning networks	BOUNDARY ORGANIZATIONS; KRISTIANSTADS-VATTENRIKE; KNOWLEDGE UTILIZATION; ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL-POLICY; WETLAND LANDSCAPE; COMANAGEMENT; SCIENCE; CREDIBILITY; DETERMINANTS	Humanity faces increasingly intractable environmental problems characterized by high uncertainty, complexity, and swift change. Natural resource governance must therefore involve continuous production and use of new knowledge to adapt to highly complex, rapidly changing social-ecological systems to ensure long-term sustainable development. Bridging and boundary organizations have been proposed as potentially powerful means of achieving these aims by promoting cooperation among actors from the science, policy, and management sectors. However, despite substantial investments of time, capital, and human resources, little agreement exists about definitions and measures of knowledge production and how this is achieved in bridging organizations and there is only meager understanding of how knowledge production and its use are shaped by social interactions, socio-political environments, and power relations. New concepts, methods, and metrics for conceptualizing and measuring learning in support of natural resource governance and testing the conditions under which it can be achieved are therefore badly needed. This paper presents an attempt at a holistic framework to address this, drawing on theory, methods, and metrics from three research areas: knowledge utilization, boundary organizations, and stakeholder theory. Taken together, these provide a solid conceptual and methodological toolkit for conducting cross-case comparisons aimed at understanding the social environmental conditions under which learning in such organizations does and does not occur. We use empirical data to show how the framework can be applied and discuss some of the practical considerations and important challenges that emerge. We close with a general discussion and an agenda for future research to promote discussion around the topic of how to erect systematic comparisons of learning in support of adaptive natural resource governance as it occurs in bridging organizations.

This is manifested in bits meeting bricks on a vast scale as instrumentation, datafication, and computation are routinely pervading urban environments. As a result, smart sustainable urbanism is becoming more and more data-driven. Explicitly, big data computing and the underpinning technologies are drastically changing the way both smart cities and sustainable cities are understood, operated, managed, planned, designed, developed, and governed in relation to sustainability in the face of urbanization. This implies that urban systems are becoming much more tightly integrated and urban domains much more highly coordinated while more holistic views and synoptic city intelligence can now be provided thanks to the possibility of drawing together and interlinking urban big data as well as reducing urban life to a form of logic and calculative procedures on the basis of powerful computational algorithms. These data-driven transformations are in turn being directed for improving, advancing, and maintaining the contribution of smart sustainable/sustainable smart cities to the goals of sustainable development. This chapter provides a comprehensive, state-of-the-art review of smart sustainable/sustainable smart cities as a leading paradigm of urbanism in terms of the underlying foundational components and assumptions, research status, issues and debates, research opportunities and challenges, future practices and horizons, and technological trends and developments. As to the findings, this chapter shows that smart sustainable urbanism involves numerous issues that are unsolved, largely ignored, or underexplored from an applied theoretical perspective. And, a large part of research in this area focuses on exploiting the potentials of big data technologies and their novel applications as an effective way to mitigate or overcome the issue of sustainable cities and smart cities being extremely fragmented as landscapes and weakly connected as approaches. The comprehensive overview of and critique on existing work on smart sustainable urbanism provides a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners in related research communities and the necessary material to inform these communities of the latest developments in the area of smart sustainable urban planning and development. The outcome of this topical review will help strategic city stakeholders to understand what they can do more to advance sustainability based on big data technology and its novel applications, and also give policymakers an opportunity to identify areas for further improvement while leveraging areas of strength with regard to the future form of sustainable smart urbanism in the era of big data.

In this paper, we propose a conceptual basis for understanding this relation, building on the approaches to power of transition studies and other strands of studies. We explore the conditions for reconfigurations to occur by analysing three cases, concerning participatory plant breeding in Italy, public food procurement in France and diversification of agrifood chains in Wales. We highlight the critical importance of creating enabling relational environments, where power reconfiguration can occur. Within this new configuration, new, diverse sources of power are mobilized and new practices and institutions are co-constructed and legitimised, establishing the conditions for new socio-technical trajectories to emerge and for further transformative potential to develop. Our results show that a more variegated and dynamic configuration of power relations is needed. Transformations of agrifood systems depend on the variety of interactions that, in a multi-scale and dynamic dimension and through the play of the different forms of power, may develop among the actors involved. Understanding these processes and the implications that they show in terms of governance is critical.

We base our paper on primary and secondary empirical data pertaining to the history of the governance of the Brazilian Amazon and the role of geographic information systems (GISs) in the region. Specifically, we argue that in order for the MDG to be achieved what is required is a thorough understanding of the differing institutional logics that have surrounded the past and current use of GIS in the Amazon region. We will argue that due to conflicting institutional logics the changes that have taken place in relation to the MDG of sustainability should be understood as being both emergent and contested. We will claim that the design and use of ICTs reflects the ways in which these conflicting logics are worked out at any moment in time. We conclude that in order for ICT to contribute to the MDGs, it is important to attend to the historical and contested institutional context and the potential for ICTs to be enacted in unanticipated ways.

Within the global commitment to sustainability, through the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), this article explores how non-state actors (water service providers) develop and sustain water infrastructure (provide, manage water systems for continued availability) in the informal settlements, through the lens of the everyday ingenuities and governance for sustainability framework, and a qualitative research approach. The study realized the involvement of individuals and group of actors in water infrastructure governance. The actors self-mobilized resources and develop low-cost water infrastructure systems. The actors engaged in a gamut of actions, transactions, clientelist (broker and clients' relationships), and interactions (buying and selling of water, networking, production, cooperation, partnerships) to manage water infrastructure, the practices were guided by unwritten rules and regulations, and not independent of state actors' interactions, but formed and developed through the relations between state and non-state water service providers. The findings suggest that water infrastructures in the informal settlements are developed and sustained through the everyday act of inventing, repetitive self-actions, ordering and disordering of the rules and mechanisms, among the inter-depending actors (producers and resellers of water), and their interactional relationship with the state water utility provider (DAWASA).

Shifting governance cooperatively-coordination by public discourses in the German water-food nexus	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Governance hybrids; Water-food nexus; Agricultural policy; Common pool resources; Nitrate pollution; Discourse network analysis	POLICY CHANGE; FRANCE; POWER	In face of the interdependencies between policy areas in the management of common pool resources, studying nexus challenges is insightful for the exploration of new governance strategies. This includes the co-occurrence of and the interaction between different governance modes. We put forward the argument that a promising approach to explore these dynamics over time is the method of discourse network analysis. By conducting a discourse network analysis of German agricultural and water policy in a region with intensive livestock farming and large surpluses of manure that exert pressure on water and soil resources, we analyse the development of discourses within and across policy areas. We show that the analysis of public discourses contributes to the understanding of coordination between actors.

Toward a national sustainable building assessment system in Oman: Assessment categories and their performance indicators Muhannad	SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Sustainable construction; Sustainability assessment tools; Survey; Oman	CONSTRUCTION; SECTOR	The new generation of sustainable building-rating systems especially in developing countries is geared toward incorporating the variations in regional social, cultural, governmental and economic aspects. Likewise, the Sultanate of Oman possess its unique local context, geographical conditions, traditions and culture. The governmental and political requirements including the Omanization program, have also been highly considered in the Oman National Comprehensive Human Development 2040. The National Development Plan 2040 of Oman aims to bring the country into a more a sustainable life style. The aim of this study is to develop a framework for sustainable building construction in Oman by proposing an assessment system for the construction industry. While addressing sustainability, the system should respect the unique context of Oman in terms of its unique geographical, political, cultural, and societal features. No dedicated sustainability-rating system currently exists for Oman. Hence, this study involves two main stages to establish the sustainability assessment system for Oman. The first stage concentrates on further developing the formulation of the proposed system structure in relation to Oman by reviewing the literature on sustainable development and buildings, as well as analyzing international and regional sustainability-rating systems. The structure of the proposed system development is composed of 5 themes (environmental, economic, social, cultural and governance requirements), 11 categories, and 86 indicators. The second stage focuses on formulating assessment categories and their relevant performance indicators, which are validated through conducting a survey including different stakeholders of the industry from building engineers, building regulators, and sustainability experts. Pairwise and direct ranking method comparisons are used as data collection methods to examine the relative importance and weights of each category and each indicator respectively. The analysis of survey data shows that a prominent relative importance and balanced weights are given to indoor environment quality, natural and human resources, social, and governance requirements. The research output shall help and promote future studies to develop a detailed assessment system for sustainable construction in Oman. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	van Kerkhoff, L; Lebel, L				van Kerkhoff, Lorrae; Lebel, Louis			Linking knowledge and action for sustainable development	ANNUAL REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENT AND RESOURCES	Annual Review of Environment and Resources		English	Review; Book Chapter						engagement; integration; participation; power; research; science	DYNAMIC THEORY; SCIENCE; POLICY; ORGANIZATIONS; GOVERNANCE; INTERESTS; GENDER; POWER	It is now commonplace to assert that actions toward sustainable development require a mix of scientific, economic, social and political knowledge, and judgments. The role of research-based knowledge in this complex setting is ambiguous and diverse, and it is undergoing rapid change both in theory and in practice. We review conventional views of the linkages between research-based knowledge and action, and the early response to concerns that these links could and should be improved, through efforts at translation and transfer. We then examine the range of critiques that challenge those conventional views by highlighting different aspects of the relationships between science and society, focusing on the implications for action toward sustainable development. We then review the theories and strategies that have emerged in the attempt to improve the linkages between research-based knowledge and action in the context of sustainability across four broad categories: participation, integration, learning, and negotiation. These form a hierarchy with respect to how deeply they engage with the various critiques. We propose that the relationships between research-based knowledge and action can be better understood as arenas of shared responsibility, embedded within larger systems of power and knowledge that evolve and change over time. The unique contribution of research-based knowledge needs to be understood in relation to actual or potential contributions from other forms of knowledge. We conclude with questions that may offer useful orientation to assessing or designing research-action arenas for sustainable development.

ACTO was created with the aim of strengthening the relations between the member countries for cooperation on regional development in the Amazon basin. The main objective of this paper is to present an institutional analysis of the organization from official documentation. In order to achieve those targets some main objectiveshave been stablished: a) present a new methodology for the analysis of environmental issues from the transdisciplinary approach; b) review the official documentation of the higher instances and c) to present the results of transversal variables analysis. To achieve these goals, it is essential a qualitative and plurimethodological approach, using the historic method and transdisciplinary appproach. The expected result is a historical and theoretical context of the organization and the identification of institutional participatory governance spaces in ACTO.

Efforts to integrate all the above aspects require a good integrated governance system that builds networking and common understanding between all the stakeholders. An integrated governance system implies that there is a need to find shared values as a binding agent of social relations at the organisational, institutional, and individual levels. This paper is based on an exploratory study that aims to identify the major components of shared values in order to strengthen the local community's common agenda for heritage conservation and sustainable livelihood. The study employed focus group discussions involving 21 respondents representing 15 stakeholders in Kilim Geoforest Park. The data collected were transcribed verbatim and went through various levels of data processing before arriving at the final themes. Five main components of shared values were developed which are: (1) natural and cultural heritage conservation; (2) infrastructure and support systems; (3) tourism and socio-economic development; (4) transfer and dissemination of knowledge; and (5) ecosystem sustainability. In general, the values of commitment, cleanliness, safety and carrying capacity received particular attention among the community stakeholders in their efforts to ensure a sustainable development of ecotourism in Kilim. Based on the findings, a framework for public education was developed grounded on the five shared values that takes into consideration the functions and responsibilities of each of the stakeholders. The educational intervention gives attention to two approaches which are stakeholder's and shared value approaches. It is hoped that the identified shared values can be incorporated into the development of an integrated governance system in Langkawi Geopark in order to help achieve the objectives of sustainable development.

These actors conduct the everyday work of bringing global agreements and state policies into being. In doing so, they influence how citizens experience the state and environmental governance. In this review paper, we provide a brief overview of existing literature on `street-level bureaucrats' (SLBs). We then suggest three key research areas through which insights into the role of SLBs in environmental governance could be further developed, including (i) the nature of SLBs agency and practice as they enact global and national environmental agendas, (ii) the subjectivities of SLBs and how they affect environmental governance and (iii) the outcomes of the activities of SLBs on state-citizen relations. This research agenda has explanatory power in understanding existing and desired environmental governance.

Given this perspective, we compare two different energy resources and their governance systems - the Eagle Ford Shale in the U.S. and the Gaucho Biodiesel Pole in Brazil. Despite the differences in terms of the nature of the energy resource, stakeholders, and institutions, both systems perform poorly in terms of governance, defined here as equity, participation, transparency, and accountability. We collected data using semi-structured interviews with stakeholders, participated in public hearings, and archival research. We found patterns that reveal asymmetric power relations amongst stakeholders and institutions, especially the dominance of the energy industry's agenda, which hinders self-regulatory autonomy of communities and societal participation.

J	Russel, D; Jordan, A				Russel, Duncan; Jordan, Andrew			Joining up or pulling apart? The use of appraisal to coordinate policy making for sustainable development	ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE			English	Article							GOVERNMENT; UK	Coordinated (or 'joined-up') approaches to policy making are said to be an immensely important ingredient in the effective governance of sustainable development. There are, however, few detailed empirical studies of how well different policy coordination instruments perform in relation to this task. This paper identifies the United Kingdom as a critical test of how to achieve better policy coordination because it has been regularly identified as an exemplar of best practice in international benchmarking exercises. Specifically, it examines the integration of the environment into mainstream policy making through the application of policy appraisal in the strategically important areas of energy, defence, and public spending. Overall, it finds that the UK's much vaunted approach to coordinating the governance of sustainable development has struggled to tame the forces of departmentalism. While deploying carefully packaged combinations of coordinating instruments may address some causes of non-joined-up behaviour, perfectly coherent policy making is always likely to remain tantalisingly out of reach.

It explores the emergence of a pattern of multi-level governance, particularly in relation to arenas for negotiation between national and regional levels. Compromises are made between the principles of competition and equality and there is great diversity across regions in terms of the capacities for developing bottom-up strategies for science-based development.

However, less attention is dedicated to the sustainability governance orientation and to the development of a strong institutional culture of sustainability, which is a key success factor to improve the quality and the image. This article observes the sustainability governance orientation, through the analysis of the information on the websites of three fair groups of universities in the international Top 500-ARWU (Academic Ranking ofWorld Universities) 2015 ranking. The aim is to verify if there is a link between the degree of sustainability culture in the management and the positioning of the universities in the international ranking. In addition, the analysis is compared with self-assessment data carried out by the same universities in terms of performance sustainability through the STARS (Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System) online platform. As principal consideration, we have noted that the best universities in the ranking have a management approach based on a shared vision of sustainability development of their university leaders, who play an essential role affirming and disseminating a sustainability culture. All this opens broader future implications intended to highlight the importance of management sustainability as a quality improvement factor of universities.

B	Walter, S		Gross, M; Heinrichs, H		Walter, Stefan			Trust and Cooperation as Requirements for Maintaining Environmental Governance Capacity	ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIOLOGY: EUROPEAN PERSPECTIVES AND INTERDISCIPLINARY CHALLENGES			English	Article; Book Chapter						Trust; Cooperation; Environmental governance; Social systems; Social change	TRIPLE-HELIX; INNOVATION; SYSTEMS	Trust can be understood as a mechanism to reduce social complexity. Trust is located in the relations between people, making it a property of social systems. Trust is a prerequisite for the functioning of society, providing a foundation upon which sustainable development, environmental justice, etc. are only possible. Consequently, there is a great interest to maintain or strengthen trust in systems and institutions, e.g., in money as an exchange medium. The requirement of trust for environmental governance sets the boundaries for social change and reduces the probability of implementing measures that might undermine trust and social cohesion, e.g., environmental policies that threaten investments in the economy. Contemporary socio-economic trends, including the acceleration of market processes, globalization, and the consequential growing complexity in society make it more difficult to maintain trust. Thus, it is questioned whether efforts that potentially improve the society-environment relationship are actually desirable in society.

Rajesh			Sustainable Development Concept in the WTO Jurisprudence: Contradictions and Connivance	ESSAYS ON SUSTAINABILITY AND MANAGEMENT: EMERGING PERSPECTIVES	India Studies in Business and Economics		English	Article; Book Chapter							ENVIRONMENT; POLICY	The Marrakesh Agreement establishing the WTO (henceforth the WTO Agreement) is primarily a trade agreement, negotiated with the objective of promotion and progressive liberalisation of international trade. The WTO preamble recognises that the relations between member states in the field of trade and economic development should be conducted with a view to "raising standards of living, ensuring full employment and a large and steadily growing volume of real income and effective demand, and expanding the production of and trade in goods and services." In this endeavour, it is acknowledged that states should allow for the "optimal use of the world's resources in accordance with the objective of sustainable development, seeking both to protect and preserve the environment and to enhance the means for doing so in a manner consistent with their respective needs and concerns at different levels of economic development." Beyond such an acknowledgement in the Preamble, the WTO and its covered agreements have largely ignored sustainable development as a binding obligation on the member states. It was perceived that such binding commitments were unnecessary as the WTO's focus is trade governance. Besides, the developing countries were genuinely concerned that any substantive obligation on sustainable development, specifically in the context of environment and labour standards, shall have an adverse impact on their competitiveness vis-a-vis developed countries goods and services. More importantly, the prospective sustainable development measures may have a strong likelihood of being misused as a protectionist tool for trade gains by advanced economies that have already attained higher standard production and process methods and livelihood standards. These concerns and oppositions have left the "sustainability" objective in the WTO much to be desired. This chapter is an attempt to understand the interlinkages and conflicts in the context of the legal foundation of "sustainable development" in the WTO architecture, an organisation created to administer trade rules. The chapter shall look specifically at the approach taken by the WTO panel and the Appellate Body in interpreting and developing the concept. Special attention shall be given to the concerns of developing countries that have all along opposed inclusion of the sustainability concept without elaborate negotiation and consensus.	[Babu, R.

Coming from a conventional command-and-control approach to environmental policy, which fitted well its centrally planned economy, transitional China is swiftly reforming and diversifying its environmental approaches, instruments, arrangements and legal regulations. This article aims to grasp and assess the direction, extent and speed of change in China's environmental governance. New relations between state, market and civil society, and an opening up towards the outside world characterise new modes of environmental governance that try to turn China's development path in more sustainable directions.

This paper aims to identify the strengths, weaknesses and challenges of municipalities in North Cyprus as they aspire to become sustainable Cittaslow tourism destinations. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative research approach was used to observe the perceptions of municipalities as they transition to become sustainable Cittaslow tourism destinations. The data have been obtained through in-depth interviews with the mayors of the municipalities that are members of the international Cittaslow network. Findings The results of the study show how alternative forms of tourism could help to improve the local economy. Also, the reasons for challenges and weaknesses are explained by the limited economic conditions of countries, high demand for mass tourism and lack of awareness about the importance of being a Cittaslow member. Practical implications This study reflects on the critical points in relation to the destination's management at the local level. It also provides empirical indicators for achieving sustainable tourism development in North Cyprus. Originality/value This study contributes to the tourism literature by addressing municipalities' roles in the sustainability of tourism destinations in developing countries, more specifically in North Cyprus. A review of the literature reveals that there are very few prior studies of the role of municipalities in sustainable Cittaslow tourism.

J	Ferraro, G; Brans, M				Ferraro, Gianluca; Brans, Marleen			Trade-offs between environmental protection and economic development in China's fisheries policy: A political analysis on the adoption and implementation of the Fisheries Law 2000	NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM			English	Article						Sustainable development; fisheries policy; China		The Rio Declaration of 1992 called for states to integrate environmental protection in their process of development in order to achieve the ultimate goal of sustainable development (Principle 4). The paper investigates to what extent the People's Republic of China (PRC) has integrated environmental protection into her fisheries policy. The environment/development nexus is analysed in relation to the adoption and implementation of the Fisheries Law of 2000. Official documents and, more importantly, interviews conducted in several organizations at multiple levels of governance disclose a complex reality beyond the formal commitment to sustainable fisheries. Diverging interests, goals and strategies can be traced beyond formal policy documents in Beijing, Guangdong and between the Centre and the Province. Inter-organizational divergences at the central and local levels, as well as between them, hinder the pursuit of environmental protection in the development of China's fisheries sector. The paper highlights the political complexity of pursuing more responsible fisheries in the multi-actor and multi-level political-administrative system of the PRC. Here, as well as in many other developing countries, economic development constitutes the policy priority. Environmental protection often remains not only an ambitious objective but also an unperceived need.

J	Yang, R; Lin, YC				Yang, Ren; Lin, Yuancheng			Rural spatial transformation and governance from the perspective of land development rights: A case study of Fenghe village in Guangzhou	GROWTH AND CHANGE			English	Article							CHINA; RECONSTRUCTION; COMMUNITY; MECHANISM; EVOLUTION	Urban expansion and the demand for sustainable regional economic development make rural land a resource base for spatial regeneration, transformation, and upgrading. From the perspective of land development rights, this paper analyzes the rural spatial transformation mechanism and rural governance logic in Fenghe village, Guangzhou. The results show that: (1) Fenghe village has experienced three stages of rural forming development, "hollowing" and space transformation. The subject of land development rights has shifted from rural collectives and villagers to external capital enterprises. Rural development pathways and land-use patterns have changed from single to diversified. The space presents trends of community, commercialization and modernization. (2) Changes in the subjects of land development rights have caused the diversification and transformation of rural space. Homesteads, idle agricultural land, industrial formats, and infrastructure have gradually become standardized, market-oriented, diversified, agglomerated, and systemized. With the diversification, complexity and consumerization of rural living groups, social relations, subject connections and rural spaces tend to be modern development models. (3) The reconstruction of rural space contains the logic of capital games and negotiated governance. Urban capital reaches a benefit balance between rural collective and villagers, obtains the right to rural land development, and forms multi-subject collaborative governance.

Analysing satellite imagery, qualitative and secondary data sources, we found that the city expanded spatially by 78% between 2001 and 2014 at an annual rate of 4.4%. Increasing human and vehicular populations added complexities to the growth experiences of the city, and collectively exact a high demand for basic infrastructure and services. The metropolis' population had better access to water and electricity but there is a huge access gap in relation to sanitary facilities, a situation that exposes the inefficiencies of the decentralised urban governance system of the city. The article argues that the state of affairs is a recipe for poor development outcomes such as low economic performance and negative public health issues. It is recommended that urban governance systems in the metropolis devise and implement innovative measures through inclusive and participatory approaches to promote sustainable urban development.

J	Bibri, SE				Bibri, Simon Elias			The anatomy of the data-driven smart sustainable city: instrumentation, datafication, computerization and related applications	JOURNAL OF BIG DATA			English	Article						Data-driven smart sustainable cities; Data-driven smart sustainable urbanism; Big data analytics; Big data applications; Datafication; Urban science; Urban sustainability; Sustainable development; Innovation labs; Urban operation centers; Urban intelligence functions	BIG DATA; URBAN FORMS; CITIES; FRAMEWORK; TYPOLOGIES; FUTURE; IOT	We are moving into an era where instrumentation, datafication, and computerization are routinely pervading the very fabric of cities, coupled with the interlinking, integration, and coordination of their systems and domains. As a result, vast troves of data are generated and exploited to operate, manage, organize, and regulate urban life, or a deluge of contextual and actionable data is produced, analyzed, and acted upon in real time in relation to various urban processes and practices. This data-driven approach to urbanism is increasingly becoming the mode of production for smart sustainable cities. In other words, a new era is presently unfolding wherein smart sustainable urbanism is increasingly becoming data-driven. However, topical studies tend to deal mostly with data-driven smart urbanism while barely exploring how this approach can improve and advance sustainable urbanism under what is labeled 'data-driven smart sustainable cities.' Having a threefold aim, this paper first examines how data-driven smart sustainable cities are being instrumented, datafied, and computerized so as to improve, advance, and maintain their contribution to the goals of sustainable development through more optimized processes and enhanced practices. Second, it highlights and substantiates the great potential of big data technology for enabling such contribution by identifying, synthesizing, distilling, and enumerating the key practical and analytical applications of this advanced technology in relation to multiple urban systems and domains with respect to operations, functions, services, designs, strategies, and policies. Third, it proposes, illustrates, and describes a novel architecture and typology of data-driven smart sustainable cities. The overall aim of this study suits thematic analysis as a research approach. I argue that smart sustainable cities are becoming knowable, controllable, and tractable in new dynamic ways thanks to urban science, responsive to the data generated about their systems and domains by reacting to the analytical outcome of many aspects of urbanity in terms of optimizing and enhancing operational functioning, management, planning, design, development, and governance in line with the goals of sustainable development. The proposed architecture, which can be replicated, tested, and evaluated in empirical research, will add additional depth to studies in the field. This study intervenes in the existing scholarly conversation by bringing new insights to and informing the ongoing debate on smart sustainable urbanism in light of big data science and analytics. This work serves to inform city stakeholders about the pivotal role of data-driven analytic thinking in smart sustainable urbanism practices, as well as draws special attention to the enormous benefits of the emerging paradigm of big data computing as to transforming the future form of such urbanism.

J	Meijer, A				Meijer, Albert			Datapolis: A Public Governance Perspective on "Smart Cities"	PERSPECTIVES ON PUBLIC MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE			English	Article								Smart cities are presented as both inevitable and benign futures: the technological development is unstoppable and will bring us wealthier, safer and more sustainable cities. Putting technology to use, however, is never entirely a matter of engineering but of strategic, political and value-laden choices. This article combines the literature on technology in the public sector and on (urban) governance to develop a public governance perspective on smart cities. The central theoretical concept "datapolis" highlights how the construction of smart cities can be understood in term of "actors", "rules", and "games" of urban governance. The theoretical analysis results in the identification of three types of actors (state, market, and civil society), three governance challenges (balancing perceptions, guaranteeing checks and balances and building upon different forms of knowing), and five governance games (the politics of data collection, data storage, data usage, data visualization and data access). The governance of smart cities is re-conceptualized as the socio-technical structures that emerge from the governance games. The governance challenge is to develop legitimate rules for perceptions, power relations and decisions in smart cities.

J	Williams, DS; Costa, MM; Celliers, L; Sutherland, C				Williams, David Samuel; Costa, Maria Manez; Celliers, Louis; Sutherland, Catherine			Informal Settlements and Flooding: Identifying Strengths and Weaknesses in Local Governance for Water Management	WATER			English	Article						water governance; multi-sector partnerships; flooding; informal settlements	CLIMATE-CHANGE; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; RISK; DURBAN; PARTICIPATION; COMMUNICATION; PERCEPTION; COMPLEXITY; CHALLENGES	Urbanization and climate change are compounding the vulnerability of flooding for the urban poor, particularly in the Global South. However, local governance can be a greater determinant of flood risk than the hazard itself. Identifying strengths and weaknesses in local governance for water management is therefore crucial. This paper presents a governance assessment for Quarry Road West informal settlement, Durban, South Africa, in relation to flood risk by applying the Capital Approach Framework. Through developing a deeper understanding of the current governance system, the embeddedness of several social values can also be gauged. This is important particularly for integrative and transdisciplinary management of flood risk, enacted in the case of Quarry Road West informal settlement through the Palmiet Rehabilitation Project, a multi sector partnership at the climate change and water governance interface. Findings from this study indicate that, currently, climate change adaptation remains a challenge for decision-makers and policy-planners. A more effective integration of the residents of Quarry Road West informal settlement into local governance for water management is urgently needed. This is particularly important in the context of informal settlements that are marginalized and often lacking governance mechanisms to affect change.

J	Zhang, JJ; Zhou, N; Hinge, A; Feng, W; Zhang, SC				Zhang, Jingjing; Zhou, Nan; Hinge, Adam; Feng, Wei; Zhang, Shicong			Governance strategies to achieve zero-energy buildings in China	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						building performance; building regulations; energy codes; energy policy; governance; net-zero; outcomes; policy; regulatory systems; zero-energy buildings; China	IMPLEMENTATION	In response to climate change, governments are developing policies to move toward ultra-low-energy or zero-energy' buildings (ZEBs). Policies, codes, and governance structures vary among regions, and there is no universally accepted definition of a ZEB. These variables make it difficult, for countries such as China that wish to set similar goals, to determine an optimum approach. This paper reviews ZEBs policies, programmes, and governance approaches in two jurisdictions that are leading ZEBs development: Denmark and the state of California in the United States. Different modes of governance (hierarchy: principal-agent relations, market: self organizing and network: independent actors) are examined specifically in relation to policy instruments (prescriptive, performance or outcome-based). The analysis highlights differences in institutional conditions and examines available data on energy performance resulting from a building policy framework. The purpose is to identify ZEBs governance and implementation deficits in China and analyse alternative governance approaches that could be employed in China, which is currently developing ZEBs targets and policies. Conclusions suggest that the ZEBs governance structure in China could benefit from widened participation by all societal actors involved in achieving ZEBs targets. China's ZEBs policies would benefit from employing a more balanced hybrid governance approach.

Unfortunately, the overt emphasis on civil and political rights within this agenda restricted greater engagement with questions concerning development. The focus on individual rights and antagonistic relations between states has led to a human rights practice that fails to achieve social inclusion for many and allows vulnerable groups to fall by the wayside. Equally unfortunately, the practice has too often focused on international level actors such as states and other entities, thus failing to take notice of national level policies and initiatives that do help bridge the gap between human rights aspirations and the actual protection of the weak and vulnerable. This article reviews some of the fundamental failings of "business as usual" in human rights practice and hypothesizes where those failings, if left unchecked. will lead in the post-2015 world. Finally, it identifies pathways away from the current model and towards sustainable development, highlighting policies from diverse jurisdictions that have been effective in protecting the vulnerable and that may he worthy of emulation at a global level.

J	Steurer, R				Steurer, Reinhard			The role of governments in corporate social responsibility: characterising public policies on CSR in Europe	POLICY SCIENCES			English	Article						Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Public policies on CSR; Business self-regulation; Business-government relations; New governance; Business-society relations; Societal co-regulation; Sustainable development	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; SELF-REGULATION; GOVERNANCE; BUSINESS; STATE; STAKEHOLDERS; INSTRUMENTS; BUREAUCRACY; TRADITIONS; SOCIETY	Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) aims to better integrate social and environmental concerns into business routines on a voluntary basis. The present article is concerned with the political side of the management approach. By systematically characterising the public policies on CSR throughout Europe, it first complements the existing, often unsystematic, accounts of how governments address CSR (mostly provided in management journals). Second, it also brings the issue closer to political science. After explaining why governments show interest in CSR, the article introduces CSR as a voluntary contribution to sustainable development. It then develops a typology of CSR policies that distinguishes five types of policy instruments (legal, economic, informational, partnering and hybrid) and four thematic fields of action (raise awareness, improve transparency, foster socially responsible investment and lead by example). Based on this systematic description of CSR policies, the article explores what CSR and the respective public policies imply for business-government relations as well as the changing patterns of regulation. It concludes that CSR started out as a neo-liberal concept that helped to downscale government regulations, but that it has in turn matured into a more progressive approach of societal co-regulation in recent years. Regarding the effectiveness and the opportunity costs of this new pattern of governance, the article emphasises that the respective assessment gaps should be filled by case study research.

J	Icasiano, CDA; Taeihagh, A				Icasiano, Charles David A.; Taeihagh, Araz			Governance of the Risks of Ridesharing in Southeast Asia: An In-Depth Analysis	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						ridesharing; governance; Southeast Asia; ASEAN; risk; transport; innovative technologies; case study	SMART	Smart and sustainable cities rely on innovative technologies to cater to the needs of their constituents. One such need is for sustainable transport. Ridesharing is one of the ways through which sustainable transport can be deployed in smart cities. Ridesharing entered Southeast Asia in 2013, changing the nature of transportation in the region. As with other disruptive innovations, the introduction of ridesharing comes with risks particularly to employment relations, data privacy, road congestion, and distribution of liability. Regulators across various countries have applied different strategies to govern these risks. We present a case study of five Southeast Asian countries, namely Singapore, the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaysia, and examine how government authorities in these countries have governed the risks of ridesharing. Smart cities can effectively provide the sustainable transport needs of their constituents by taking a consistent and unified regulatory approach with new technologies and cooperating with regulators across different jurisdictions. Stakeholders should also be involved in the regulatory process to increase the acceptance of new technologies for transport. Smart cities can also deploy regulatory sandboxes and take a proactive governance approach to encourage the development of these new technologies and at the same time control their undesirable risks.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper reports an inclusive examination of international and national guidelines in relation to the code of ethics and ethical values in making the disclosure. Findings - The final 10 categories and 40 items under review have been developed in an instrument, the proposed EVDi, for measuring the commitment undertaken by companies in communicating ethical values information to stakeholders. Research limitations/implications - The EVDi may fulfil the function of good governance to inculcate ethical work culture throughout companies. Social implications - Effective ethical values in communication may reduce the likelihood of illegal activities and cost of acting unethically in organisations. Originality/value - The value of this paper is its approach of using the isomorphism concept from the institutional theory to address the SDG 16 by developing the EVDi. The new index incorporates core elements of moral values adapted mainly from the professional bodies that regulate the accounting profession and other related organisations. The index is an initiative used to measure companies' commitment to promoting ethical values through disclosure. The efforts to measure the level of commitment supporting the SDG 16 promote effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels.

Informed by literatures on international relations, regulatory governance of global commodity production, and international pathways of domestic influence, key arrangements are aggregated into six types, and mapped in terms of their main aims, instruments, and implementation mechanisms. Key analytical dimensions, such as the actors involved (state-private-mixed), the character of legal authority (legally binding-non-legally binding), and the geopolitical scope (global-transnational) helped to identify the potential and limitations of arrangements. They were assessed and compared in terms of their main pathways of influence such as international hard-law rules, cross-sectoral policy integration, non-legally binding norms and discourses, global market mechanisms, and direct access through capacity building. Our results reveal important challenges in the design and implementation, and in the pathways of influence, of the forest governance arrangements, including major inconsistencies with forest-adverse economic sectors. We conclude about the need for coherent international forest-related policy cooperation and integrative actions in agriculture, bioenergy, and mining to enhance the prospects of achieving the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.

This is a consequence of our awareness of the fact that employees and personnel processes play a vital role in translating the policy of sustainable development into practice. The objective of this research has been to diagnose the activity of young Polish enterprises in the area of SRHRM as an important corporate social responsibility (CSR) component and to assess relations between SRHRM practices and the sustainable development of organizations. The studies conducted on a representative sample of 150 entities demonstrate both the scope of SRHRM practical implementation and the fields which have disparity in this respect. It has been determined that SRHRM practices are quite frequently adopted by young Polish enterprises. Research has shown that there is a correlation between the assessment of the relationship of SRHRM practices with the sustainable development of organizations and their practical implementation. It has been established that the higher the assessment of the strength of the relations of a given practice, the more often it is implemented in the enterprises studied. Simultaneously, the research has demonstrated a low level of maturity with respect to SRHRM implementation, as evidenced by the adoption of basic practices.

In the past, there have been relevant studies to explore the impact of corporate sustainability education and training and sustainable rewards on employees' sustainable behavior. However, the results were not significant. Thus, this study constructed a prediction model to examine the relationship between the abovementioned factors, moving beyond the previous related studies. Employees of Common Wealth Magazine's Sustainable Citizenship Award-winning companies were selected as the research objects to verify whether employees' perception of corporate sustainable responsibility has a mediating effect. The instrument was developed from a literature review and related survey items, which consisted of 35 items and four dimensions. The instrument's validity and reliability passed the required standards. Through judgmental sampling, a total of 345 valid responses were collected. Through hierarchical regression analysis, we found that sustainability training and sustainable rewards have a significant impact on employees' sustainable behavior. The scientific value of this study is the contribution of the framework model for employees' perception of corporate sustainable responsibility, which has a mediating effect. It provides practical evidence that employees' perception of corporate sustainable responsibility plays a partial mediation role.

Focusing on the United Nations Collaborative Programme to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+), the paper presents a theoretical framework, through which stakeholder perceptions of REDD+ governance quality and institutional legitimacy can be evaluated. This is tested by means of a small-n survey of state and non-state participants from both the developed and developing countries, including the Asia-Pacific region. The survey results reveal generally higher ratings for REDD+ amongst Southern participants than in the North. A number of caveats are placed on the interpretation of data, and some conclusions drawn regarding contemporary climate governance and the emergence of a possible 'South/North Divide', challenging traditional notions of global power politics.

J	Masefield, SC; Msosa, A; Grugel, J				Masefield, Sarah C.; Msosa, Alan; Grugel, Jean			Challenges to effective governance in a low income healthcare system: a qualitative study of stakeholder perceptions in Malawi	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article						Healthcare governance; Malawi; Stakeholders; Universal health coverage; Social accountability; Health care delivery; SDG 3; Low income countries	COVERAGE LESSONS	Background All countries face challenging decisions about healthcare coverage. Malawi has committed to achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by 2030, the timeframe set out by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As in other low income countries, scarce resources stand in the way of more equitable health access and quality in Malawi. Its health sector is highly dependent on donor contributions, and recent poor governance of government-funded healthcare saw donors withdraw funding, limiting services and resources. The 2017 National Health Plan II and accompanying Health Strategic Plan II identify the importance of improved governance and strategies to achieve more effective cooperation with stakeholders. This study explores health sector stakeholders' perceptions of the challenges to improving governance in Malawi's national health system within the post-2017 context of government attempts to articulate a way forward. Methods A qualitative study design was used. Interviews were conducted with 22 representatives of major international and faith-based non-government organisations, civil society organisations, local government and government-funded organisations, and governance bodies operating in Malawi. Open questions were asked about experiences and perceptions of the functioning of the health system and healthcare decision-making. Content relating to healthcare governance was identified in the transcripts and field notes and analysed using inductive content analysis. Results Stakeholders view governance challenges as a significant barrier to achieving a more effective and equitable health system. Three categories were identified: accountability (enforceability; answerability; stakeholder-led initiatives); health resource management (healthcare financing; drug supply); influence in decision-making (unequal power; stakeholder engagement). Conclusions Health sector stakeholders see serious political, structural, and financial challenges to improving governance in the national health system in Malawi which will impact the government's goal of achieving UHC by 2030. Stakeholders identify the need for improved oversight, implementation, service delivery and social accountability of government-funded service providers to communities. Eighteen months after the introduction of the policy documents, they see little evidence of improved governance and have little or no confidence in the government's ability to deliver UHC. The difficulties stakeholders perceive in relation to building equitable and effective healthcare governance in Malawi have relevance for other resource-limited countries which have also committed to the goal of UHC.

J	Otsuki, K				Otsuki, Kei			Ecological rationality and environmental governance on the agrarian frontier: The role of religion in the Brazilian Amazon	JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES			English	Article						Agrarian frontier; Ecological rationality; Environmental governance; Religion; Brazil; Amazon	SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; LAND; DEFORESTATION; STATE; WAR	The conventional understanding of environmental governance implicitly assumes a priori presence of citizen rationality that underpins constitution of civil society vis-S-vis state. This assumption tends to overlook the economic and ecological consequences of social interactions through which people with diverse forms of rationality gradually produce distinction between state and society and shape environmental governance as an embedded process. This paper presents a case study of spontaneous settlers called posseiros in the south-east of the state of Pars in the Brazilian Amazon and examines ways that their social interactions lead to the so-called emancipation movements for municipal making on the agrarian frontier and open civic places in which environmental governance is negotiated. It pays particular attention to the role of religion, especially the Pentecostal Church of Assembly of God in relation to the traditional Catholic Church, in influencing the posseiros' ecological rationality and the articulation of emancipation movements and argues that the focus on religion sheds new light on the linkage between the environment, livelihoods and local governance. The paper concludes by discussing pragmatic implications of the case study for promoting sustainable rural development. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ahmad, E				Ahmad, Ehtisham			Multilevel financing of sustainable infrastructure in China-Policy options for inclusive, resilient and green growth	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE POLICY AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						investment; human capital; taxation and subsidies; intergovernmental fiscal relations; environmental policy		COVID- 19 has amplified existing imbalances, institutional and financing constraints associated with a development strategy that did not take sufficient account of challenges with emissions, environmental damage and health risks associated with climate change in a number of countries, including China. The recovery from the pandemic can be combined with appropriately designed investments that take into account human, social, natural and physical capital, as well as distributional objectives, that can also address commitments under the Paris agreement. An important criterion for sustainable development is that the tax regimes at the national and subnational levels should reflect the same criteria as the investment strategy. Own-source revenues, are essential to be able to access private financing, including local government bonds and PPPs in a sustainable manner. Governance criteria are also important including information on the buildup of liabilities at all levels of government, to ensure transparent governance. Despite differences in political systems, the Chinese experiences are relevant in a wide range of emerging market countries as the measures utilize institutions and policies reflecting international best practices, including modern tax administrations for the VAT, and income taxes, and benefitlinked property taxes, as well as utilization of balance sheets information consistent with the IMF's Government Financial Statistics Manual, 2014. The options have significant implications for policy advice and development cooperation for meeting global climate change goals while ensuring sustainable employment generation with transparency and accountability.

Identifying Ecosystem Key Factors to Support Sustainable Water Management	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						pentatope model; natural valuation; ecosystem key factors; environmental quality standards; ecosystem-economy nexus; natural resources; sustainable ecological limits	SERVICES; TRAITS; RESILIENCE; VALUATION; SYSTEMS	There is a growing consensus that sustainable development requires a behavioral change, forced by firm decision-making. However, existing decision-supporting tools are unlikely to provide relevant information, hampered by the complexity of combined socio-economic and natural systems Protecting the intrinsic value of ecosystems and providing sufficient natural resources for human use at the same time leads up to a wide span of management, ranging from species traits to governance. The aim of this study is to investigate the interactions between the natural and economic systems from the perspective of sustainable development. The way to reduce systems complexity by selecting key factors of ecosystem functioning for policy and management purposes is discussed. To achieve this, the Pentatope Model is used as a holistic framework, an ecosystem nodes network is developed to select key factors, and a combined natural and socio-economic valuation scheme is drawn. These key factors abiotic resources and conditions, biodiversity, and biomass are considered fundamental to the ecosystem properties habitat range and carrying capacity. Their characteristics are discussed in relation to sustainable water management. The conclusion is that sustainable development requires environmental decision-making that includes the intrinsic natural value, and should be supported by ecological modelling, additional environmental quality standards, and substance balances.

Development as a historical component of the United Nations' crime policy agenda: From social defence to the Millennium Development Goals	CRIMINOLOGY & CRIMINAL JUSTICE			English	Article						Crime-development nexus; global crime; global governance; Sustainable Development Goals; United Nations		This article presents a historical analysis of the intellectual and institutional origins of the international community's interest in the link between crime and development leading up to the adoption of the Millennium Development Goals in 2000. Drawing on a combination of documentary sources and interviews with long-time international crime policy insiders, it traces this interest back to the United Nations' social defence agenda which emerged in the aftermath of the Second World War. We situate this agenda in relation to the Western aspiration to advance the Modernization project and reflect on how its shortcomings together with ideological, economic and geopolitical shifts at the international level contributed to the diversification of the United Nations' crime policy agenda during the 1970s. These conditions collectively influenced the international community's growing concern with crime as an existential threat to economic development during the 1980s. Our analysis highlights how this framing was reinforced by the rise of transnational organized crime as a threat to global capitalism following the collapse of the Soviet Union. It was against this historical backdrop that the United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention was established to lead the international community's fight against 'uncivil society'. We conclude by reflecting on United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention's tumultuous early years along with the omission of 'crime' from the Millennium Development Goals and suggest that these conditions, along with the adoption of the United Nations Conventions Against Transnational Organized Crime and Corruption, set the stage for the organization's future advocacy for the inclusion of crime in the Sustainable Development Goals.

J	Bijl, R				Bijl, Rob			Never Waste a Good Crisis: Towards Social Sustainable Development	SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	17th World Congress of Sociology	JUL 11-17, 2010	Gothenburg, SWEDEN	Int Sociolog Assoc		Sustainability; Quality of life; Social capital; Monitoring		The report by the Stiglitz Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress highlighted the idea that sustainability in essence is about quality of life. This paper discusses and elaborates this notion. It argues that sustainable development should be seen as a process which does not focus on economic development alone, but which also includes well-balanced ecological and social development. Social aspects of sustainability deserve attention because of their instrumental and intrinsic relevance. A society needs a sense of community and commitment. The presence of social capital is very important for the liveability of a society. It is argued that the amount of social capital may fluctuate over time. This means that in the long term, future societies may be better in a social respect (more trust, more participation, less inequality) than today's. Ensuring social sustainability is thus not only a matter of ensuring that present social cohesion is preserved, but also ensuring that this cohesion will increase or improve. The paper ends by addressing lines of research on social sustainability. The following research themes are mentioned: (1) Quality of life, social capital and social cohesion in a longitudinal perspective. (2) 'Sustainability of what, why and for whom?' Sustainability as an issue of choice: trade-offs. (3) Civil society and governance aspects of sustainability. (4) Public perceptions, values and opinions with regard to sustainability issues and (5) Fairness and inequality in relation to sustainability policy, both nationally and internationally.

Integrative environmental governance: enhancing governance in the era of synergies	CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article							SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; POLICY INTEGRATION; PARTNERSHIPS; BIODIVERSITY; FRAMEWORK; POLITICS; CONSERVATION; PERFORMANCE; CHALLENGES; PRINCIPLES	The issue of regime complexity in global environmental governance is widely recognized. The academic debate on regime fragmentation has itself however been rather fragmented, with discussions circling around different concepts, including inter-organizational relations, polycentric governance, integrated management, landscape governance, environmental policy integration, coordination, mainstreaming, coherence, policy mixes, governance architectures and systems, regime complexes, institutional interaction, metagovernance and the nexus approach. Moreover, the topic of relationships between different policies is also discussed among practitioners, where the call for synergies is increasingly heard. This article brings together these discussions under the common heading of integrative environmental governance (IEG). The article provides a literature review, and argues for an IEG perspective in which the relationships between governance instruments take center stage.

J	Wesley, A; Pforr, C				Wesley, Anthea; Pforr, Christof			The governance of coastal tourism: unravelling the layers of complexity at Smiths Beach, Western Australia	JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM			English	Article						coastal tourism; politics; power; stakeholders; governance; Australia	POLICY NETWORKS; PARTICIPATION; COLLABORATION; STAKEHOLDERS; EMPOWERMENT; POWER	Fuelled by rapid population growth, coastal regions are increasingly vulnerable to the dynamic mix of coastal uses. In Western Australia, for instance, the issues associated with infrastructure shortcomings and increased population pressures have led to a spate of interest in the development of tourism and residential proposals along the coast. Many of these have emerged as hotly debated sociopolitical contests, thus raising questions in relation to the governance of coastal tourism. It is the intent of this paper to provide empirical insights into the practical nature of coastal tourism governance, using the Smiths Beach coastal tourism and residential development as a case study. An exploratory case approach is adopted so as to understand why this particular coastal tourism development has been surrounded by so much criticism and controversy. The exploration of the attitudes, experiences and views of various stakeholders have illustrated the inherent flavour of this case, with the issues of power-politics, divergent interests and agendas and lack of community consultation identified as some of the key aspects shaping the debate. The case therefore provides an ideal avenue to reveal the complex nature and key issue drivers associated with the governance of coastal tourism.

J	Manescu, C				Manescu, Cristiana			Stock Returns in Relation to Environmental, Social and Governance Performance: Mispricing or Compensation for Risk?	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						SRI; sustainability; risk-factor test; market efficiency	EQUILIBRIUM	Using detailed data on seven environmental, social and governance (ESG) attributes for a long panel of large publicly traded US firms during July 1992-June 2008, only community relations were found to have had a positive effect on risk-adjusted stock returns, which effect was not compensation for risk but could be due to mispricing. Additionally, a changing effect of employee relations was found, from positive during July 1992-June 2003 to negative during July 2003-June 2008. The positive effect could be due to mispricing, whereas there is some evidence that the negative effect was compensation for low non-sustainability risk. A weak negative effect of human rights and product safety indicators on risk-adjusted stock returns in the more recent period was also found to be likely due to mispricing. The implications are that certain ESG attributes might be value relevant but they are not efficiently incorporated into stock prices. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

The Swedish Species Observation System (Artportalen) is one of the largest inscription and calculation centers for citizen data in the world, used extensively by public authorities in Sweden. Observations by members of the public become actionable through environmental governance laws in Sweden. These observations are made through networks of things and humans in which trust is created but unevenly distributed.

J	Coenen, J; Newig, J; Meyfroidt, P				Coenen, Johanna; Newig, Jens; Meyfroidt, Patrick			Environmental governance of a Belt and Road project in Montenegro-National agency and external influences	LAND USE POLICY			English	Article						Environmental planning; Sustainable development; Land use; Transport; Southeastern Europe	INFRASTRUCTURE; CONSTRUCTION	China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is an ambitious effort to increase trans-continental connectivity and cooperation mainly through infrastructure investments and trade. On the one hand, this globally unparalleled initiative is expected to foster economic growth, but on the other hand, it can have substantial environmental implications. The BRI creates new challenges and opportunities for environmental governance as new actor constellations emerge in BRI host countries to plan and construct large infrastructure projects. Although China has outlined its vision of building a "green Belt and Road", it remains unknown how it unfolds on the ground.As an example of a BRI project with clear environmental implications, we present a case study of the BarBoljare highway in Montenegro. Based on expert interviews, we elucidate the complex web of actors and contractual arrangements involved, and demonstrate how internal and external actors exert influence on domestic environmental governance in this EU candidate country in the Western Balkans. We find that Montenegro has substantial agency over the environmental governance of this BRI project, but shows little concern over the environmental impacts of the project. Environmental issues could have been prevented during the spatial planning phase, but important governance instruments such as the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) were of limited effectiveness due to its fast and late completion, lack of assessment of alternative routes, and the limited enforcement of the provisions therein. International institutions like the EU or UNESCO have drawn on their normative power in environmental governance to demand greater environmental safeguards from Montenegrin authorities. This case is illustrative of a larger set of BRI projects which run the risk of falling short on sustainability due to a lack of environmentally sound and transparent planning and implementation.

J	Fama, M; Corrado, A				Fama, Marco; Corrado, Alessandra			"Food security" and "sustainable development" as prophecies of a new agri-food regime in World-Ecology	RELACIONES INTERNACIONALES-MADRID			Spanish	Article						Food Regimes; World-ecology; Agenda 2030; Sustainable Development; Food Security	POLITICS	From the 1970s onwards, the development programs promoted by key global actors have gone through significant transformations. The industrial-expansion projects of the post-colonial era have been replaced with a set of actions increasingly focused on agriculture and rural areas. At the same time, the neoliberal policies carried out since the 1980s have deeply affected the global dynamics related to food production and distribution, giving rise to the birth of a new food regime that is driven by new modalities of regulation and new extractive strategies based on global value chains and transnational corporations. Despite the increases in productivity and the decline in food prices linked to these processes, the world economy has not managed to recover the levels of growth prior to the crisis of the 1970s. On the contrary, the neoliberal reaction to this crisis has generated a growing disillusionment towards development, fuelled also by the awakening of greater sensitivity to the ecological issues raised by environmental movements from as early as the 1960s. This "legitimacy crisis" of development, in turn, has led multilateral organisations to redefine their strategic objectives and to develop a new language. Thus, concepts such as "sustainable development" and "food security" have become increasingly important, until assuming the crucial role they currently play within the United Nations 2030 Agenda. The article provides a critical reading of the recent trajectories of agrarian change and rural development, as well as of the food narratives produced by the actors of global governance, particularly focusing on the "sustainability discourse" which inspired the United Nations 2030 Agenda. The authors point out the importance of analysing the dominant discourse and policies surrounding food production and distribution in the light of capitalist restructuring arising from the recurrent accumulation crises. In doing so, they put into dialogue food regimes analysis with world-ecology theory. The departing assumption is that capitalism - as a system characterised by a specific combination of class relations, territorial power and nature - has relied on the expansion and deepening of the frontier of accumulation, needing to continuously identify new effective ways to combine the exploitation of labour with the free appropriation of the work of human and extra-human nature. In this sense,"cheap nature" - following Jason Moore's definition - represents at once a prerequisite of capitalist development and a historical product of evolving strategies of accumulation reproducing a metabolic rift between humans and nature. These strategies are always based on a specific international division of labour and determined by global economic and geopolitical dynamics. At the same time, they are also characterised by changing patterns of (semi) proletarisation, as well as by ways of organizing nature whose constant renewal is crucial for the reproduction of capitalism. What truly distinguishes the current global scenario from the past is the "end of cheap nature", i.e. the exhaustion of the frontiers and the value relationships that have historically allowed for a reduction in the cost of four fundamental elements: labor, food, energy and raw materials. Against this phenomenon, by looking at the recent trajectories of the accumulation strategies underlying food production and distribution, two main dynamics emerge: the first one is hinged on a reconfiguration of extractivism based on natural resources dispossession and land concentration processes, as well as on a cost-reduction strategy based on labour exploitation; the second one can be portrayed as the reflex of a new governmental approach to development according to which the formal reunification of the producers with some basic means of production is functional to their inclusion into the global value-chains ruled by the agri-business corporations. Leveraging the neoliberal rhetoric of self-entrepreneurship, this second dynamic put into practice a sort of "indirect proletarisation", in which the incitement of the individual creative and productive capabilities accompanies the implementation of new mechanisms of control based on the provision of credit and other inputs, as well as on the proliferation of standardisation procedures, practices of patenting of nature, and technological control. Under these premises, the authors read the food security discourse embedded in the UN 2030 Agenda as an attempt to elude the socioecological contradictions inherent in capitalism, which ends up providing a sort of ideological legitimacy to the aforementioned dynamics, thereby engendering new explosive contradictions. The article is divided into three sections. The first one retraces the transformations that the capitalist world-ecology has experienced from the 1970s onwards from a food regimes approach. The second section aims to deconstruct the discursive practices underlying the United Nations 2030 Agenda, as well as to bring to light the ambiguities and contradictions inherent in development policies inspired by the concepts of 'sustainable development' and 'food security'. In the last section, the authors use the world-ecology perspective to interpret ongoing agrarian change dynamics. In seeking to revitalise the neoliberal development model, the authors argue, the dominant food narratives use scarcity as a pretext to extend and intensify the logics of the market, turning it into a universal principle for the regulation of human and extra-human nature. Dominant food policies aim to elude the problems deriving from the exhaustion of the frontier logic underlying the historical evolution of capitalism through the creation of a new spatiality and a new way of organising nature. Yet, this operation exacerbates the tension between capital's inclination towards the commodification/monetisation of ever new areas outside the sphere of production and its need to keep relying on extended sources of unpaid work of human and extra-human nature. The lack of new effective solutions to this tension is, in turn, feeding a combination of contrasting tendencies. While it produces a deepening of the mechanisms of control and exploitation driven by global market logics, it also nourishes processes of de-globalisation, along with a set of phenomena which recall the dynamics described by Karl Polanyi's theory of the "double movement". At the same time, it has also constituted a fertile ground for the emergence of new conflicts, counter-narratives and anti-systemic movements for food sovereignty and agroecology. The authors come to the conclusion that the reorganisation of the food regime in XXI century world-ecology will be highly affected by the responses provided to the ongoing pandemic crisis, thus representing an important opportunity for each of the aforementioned tendencies to gain ground over the others.

Measuring sustainability performance of rice cultivation in Thailand using Sustainable Rice Platform indicators	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article; Early Access						Sustainable rice cultivation; Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP); SRP score; performance indicators (Pis); Thailand		The sustainability level of current rice farming practices in Thailand was assessed based on in-field data from interviewing 2000 farmers covering six rice varieties and their different production systems. Data were collected on farmers' characteristics and farming activities according to the 41 requirements of the Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP) standard. The SRP scores ranged from 53 to 81%, with the best performance by Khao Dawk Mali 105 cultivated in rainfed, organic production systems. The key success factors were linked to the formation of a farmer group resulting in very good performance on farm management, Integrated Pest Management, health and safety, and water use. The proposed 12 performance indicators (Pis) interconnected with the 41 requirements are considered appropriate to measure and monitor progress toward sustainable rice cultivation for policy makers. Pls for good governance, affordability of living costs, energy-use efficiency, and life satisfaction could potentially be added, considering the local context in relation to sustainable agriculture goals. The successful cases of SRP-certified rice farms and the benefits from SRP implementation should be conveyed to with other rice farmers to induce wider implementation. The SRP scores and Pls were useful to identify areas requiring priority interventions to make progress toward sustainability.

The chapter sets out the achievements of EFA including some success in uniting diverse interests around a common set of goals. It will also discuss the key tensions related to the Northern and Western-led nature of EFA; tensions between the multilateral agencies over the leadership of EFA and the issues associated with the hegemonic status assumed by the World Bank; the tension between a wider EFA agenda and a narrower focus on a few quantifiable targets; and the associated tensions between more economistic and rights-based views of EFA. It will be argued that the development of these tensions can be understood in relation to different kinds of power linked to the international political economy and to the impact of other global regimes.

To this end, the present study examines drivers and outcomes from the perspective of business partners, as well as their relationships to the SDGs. Design/methodology/approach Through a mixed-methods approach this research studies 71 businesses from four large cross-sector partnerships formed to achieve local sustainability goals. Data were collected through a survey to determine why firms partner and what outcomes they obtain from partnering. Qualitative content analyses are used to determine the relationships between business drivers and outcomes from partnering for local sustainability and the SDGs. Findings From a resource-based view (RBV) perspective, findings show the value of local sustainability partnerships in relation to the SDGs. Many SDG targets are aligned with the top reasons why businesses join large community sustainability partnerships. Also, through the outcomes achieved by participating in the partnership businesses can further the SDGs. Research limitations/implications This research contributes to the literature and to practice through the understanding of businesses partnering for local sustainability, and its relationships to global sustainability. Firstly, the connections of business partners to local and global sustainability are better understood. Of note is the contribution made to the literature on sustainability-related drivers and outcomes expanding and refining RBV literature. Secondly, a positive connection has been established between businesses and the SDGs, proposing a virtuous model of relationship that summarizes the findings from this research. And thirdly, large cross-sector social partnerships are better understood. Practical implications Small- and medium-sized enterprises and large corporations with local offices can further both local and global sustainable development by engaging in local cross-sector sustainability partnerships. Social implications These research findings are crucial for those leading sustainability initiatives, so they can engage businesses actively in light of the important role they play in society improving their contributions and the chances for sustainability partnerships to achieve their goals. Originality/value This research contributes to the scale conversation by exploring community sustainability partnerships as a means to understand how business engagement in sustainability at the local level can contribute to the achievement of the SDGs and, ultimately, to global sustainability.

Hadi Harman; Sani, Sham; Yusoff, Ghazali			A study on negotiations of the Montreal Protocol: Focusing on global environmental governance specifically on global forum of the United Nations Environmental Programme	JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Negotiations; Montreal protocol; global environmental governance		Global environmental governance provides the main framework for global cooperation among the global community in order to safeguard Mother Nature at the national, regional and international levels. At each level the responsibility has turned out to be increasingly multifarious as new protagonists and concerns are drawn into the global environmental governance process. Some of the global environmental governance scholars have suggested that a global forum might have an influence on the negotiations for creating MEAs, which include the Montreal Protocol 1987. Moreover, the existence of such a forum would lead to global cooperation in order to achieve sustainable development. The Montreal Protocol has managed to seek international environmental cooperation among almost all of the states in the world, which made the Montreal Protocol become a successful one. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study is to explain the influence of the UNEP global forum in the global environmental governance with regard to the Montreal Protocol's early negotiations and the relations of the interstates' participation response. This study has adopted the qualitative approach which is based on the meetings' proceeding reports of the Montreal Protocol. This study has also acknowledged that the global forum of the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) had played an essential role as a strong environmental forum to influence the Montreal Protocol's early negotiations and the response of the interstates' participation. Based on the results of the analysis, we have identified the main themes as activities and committees, while the eight sub-themes are meetings, workshops, conferences, coordinating committees, secretariat, advisory panel, working groups and Governing Council. Finally, the preliminary findings indicate that having the Montreal Protocol negotiated under the global forum of the UNEP is important in terms of the establishment 'surrounding' that was formed, whereby the negotiating countries were only subject to a small number of 'external' forces, compared to global forum elsewhere.

Sacrificing the local to support the national: Politics, sustainability, and governance in Nepal's hydropower paradox	ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Run-of-the-river (ROR) hydropower; Energy justice; Sustainable development; Mountain environments	ENERGY JUSTICE; RENEWABLE ENERGY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PROJECTS; IMPACTS; ECOLOGY; RUN; TRANSITIONS; CHINA; DAMS	Developing run-of-the-river (ROR) hydropower can pose a sustainability paradox. The paradox can occur when countries prioritize hydropower development to achieve national-level sustainable development targets while failing to include project-affected communities in planning processes. This research developed a comparative study examining the ways social and political relations were articulated between hydropower companies and project-affected communities across 12 ROR hydropower sites in the Gandaki River basin of Nepal. The study details how the introduction of hydropower can feasibly offer local communities coveted benefits such as increased water and electricity access and availability. Outcomes of ROR hydropower development, however, were not uniform across study sites and spatially uneven development was manifest. Consequently, many of Nepal's ROR hydropower projects exacerbate social and political inequalities in Nepal's mountain river basins, which in turn fuel hydropower driven conflicts. Drawing on theories of global change, energy justice, and political ecology, this research highlights opportunities currently being neglected in Nepal to bring local communities into processes linked to national sustainable development goals and targets and to address injustices embedded in the development of ROR hydropower resources.

J	Ulbrich, P; de Albuquerque, JP; Coaffee, J				Ulbrich, Philipp; de Albuquerque, Joao Porto; Coaffee, Jon			The Impact of Urban Inequalities on Monitoring Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals: Methodological Considerations	ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION			English	Article						SDGs; urban inequality; urban governance; inclusive development; participatory geospatial methods; citizen-generated data; data practices; urban indicators	GEOGRAPHY	There is much discussion regarding the Sustainable Development Goals' (SDGs) capacity to promote inclusive development. While some argue that they represent an opportunity for goal-led alignment of stakeholders and evidence-based decision-making, other voices express concerns as they perceive them as a techno-managerial framework that measures development according to quantitatively defined parameters and does not allow for local variation. We argue that the extent to which the positive or negative aspects of the SDGs prevail depends on the monitoring system's ability to account for multiple and intersecting inequalities. The need for sub-nationally (urban) representative indicators poses an additional methodological challenge-especially in cities with intra-urban inequalities related to socio-spatial variations across neighbourhoods. This paper investigates the extent to which the SDG indicators' representativeness could be affected by inequalities. It does so by proposing a conceptual framing for understanding the relation between inequalities and SDG monitoring, which is then applied to analyse the current methodological proposals for the indicator framework of the "urban SDG," Goal 11. The outcome is a call for (1) a more explicit attention to intra-urban inequalities, (2) the development of a methodological approach to "recalibrate" the city-level indicators to account for the degree of intra-urban inequalities, and (3) an alignment between methodologies and data practices applied for monitoring SDG 11 and the extent of the underlying inequalities within the city. This would enable an informed decision regarding the trade-off in indicator representativeness between conventional data sources, such as censuses and household surveys, and emerging methods, such as participatory geospatial methods and citizen-generated data practices.

Drawing on environmental law, green criminology, and international relations, the article examines the development of environmental security scholarship over recent decades and shows similarities and differences in perspectives across the three disciplines. It demonstrates that the Anthropocene represents a significant challenge for thinking about and responding to security and the environment. It argues a rethinking is needed, and this can benefit from reaching across the disciplinary divide in three key areas that have become a shared focus of attention and debate regarding security in the Anthropocene. These are, first, examining the implications of the Anthropocene for our understanding of the environment and security; second, addressing and resolving contests between environmental securities; and third, developing new governance responses that mix polycentric and state-backed regulation to bring safety and security to the planet.

The article analyses evidence and lessons learnt over the last twenty years to inform policy through a review of theoretical advances, innovations in principles and policy instruments, outcomes of problem-solving and knowledge gained regarding water agreements and associated institutions. Important international agreement principles of no significant harm and economic frames of water as a 'commons' advance equity and community of interest in relation to water. The studies on water, sanitation and hygiene point to the ways the role of the state can be advanced in achieving Sustainable Development Goals and in complex contexts of water scarcity and public private partnerships. Cross-disciplinary learnings substantiate the existence and utility of multiple water frames in legal arrangements and use of multiple policy instruments. Cross-disciplinary insights are significant in addressing equity, whether through the nascent development of water indicators or in advancing social learning. Water governance frameworks increasingly focus on adaptation by incorporating multiple stakeholders. These findings that advance equity and inclusivity are tempered by crucial lessons in our understanding of the very contested, power-laden nature of water governance that impact agency at multiple scales and policy coordination across sectors of water, food and energy.

Yet such initiatives are also regulatory mechanisms that establish voluntary alternative arrangements for governing production, commercialization and consumption of global commodities. Based on a recent study of fair trade coffee experiences in Latin America, this paper explores the changes that fair trade represents in governance of the coffee commodity chain. It argues that fair trade coffee governance is shaped both by formal organizational arrangements for coordination and control and, less formally, by the social and political relations embedded in fair trade's commodity chain. Fair trade's alternative governance arrangements represent one of the initiative's major accomplishments but also pose some of its most significant challenges for the future.

To achieve this, transition processes need to be designed in key areas such as housing, mobility and nutrition. The design and large-scale implementation of sustainable product service systems (PSS) is regarded a promising approach for sustainability transitions. Real-life socio-technical experiments are an important infrastructure for designing PSS in collaboration with stakeholders and users. In this paper, we argue that transdisciplinary and action research methods are required for institutionalising an experimental set-up and developing PSS within such infrastructures. We present the Sustainable LivingLabs (SLL) research infrastructure and its methodology as an example of such experimental settings. It was collaboratively developed with key stakeholders in three consecutive research projects and applied to e.g. heating and space heating. We show new qualities of SLL in relation to existing LivingLabs and approaches for PSS design and present its methodological three-phase model (insight research, prototyping, field testing) of research. Our article contributes to knowledge on a methodological framework and tool-kit for PSS development in SLL with a clear focus on socio-ecological sustainability. Intermediate findings confirm the high influence of user practices on heating energy consumption and show starting points for PSS development: e.g. transformational products, home-automation combined with consulting along value chains. We hypothesise that developing PSS in user- and stakeholder-integrated settings supports acceptance and diffusion and, by taking into account users' social practices of utilising novelties, reduces rebound effects caused by incorrect application.

J	Partelow, S; Nelson, K				Partelow, Stefan; Nelson, Katherine			Social networks, collective action and the evolution of governance for sustainable tourism on the Gili Islands, Indonesia	MARINE POLICY			English	Article							ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS; TROPICAL COASTAL; GROUP-SIZE; FRAMEWORK; HETEROGENEITY; INSTITUTIONS; COMPLEXITY; COMMONS	This article examines how social networks among actors in the tourism sector have facilitated the evolution of self-organized institutions for governance on the island of Gili Trawangan, Indonesia. Increasing tourism for SCUBA diving and nightlife is driving rapid social-ecological change and challenges for sustainability in relation to waste management, social-political cohesion and conservation. While strong social networks were a sufficient means to initiate governance among the island's few early businesses in the 1990's and early 2000's, an increasing number of actors (i.e., new SCUBA businesses and hotels) and more tourists are challenging the ability of social networks to be the foundation of effective governance, where there is now an evident need for the evolution of governance to more effectively address sustainability challenges. This article combines quantitative social network analysis with the qualitative analysis of interview data, participant observations and an ethnographic examination of the island's changing social-political sphere of cooperation to examine the evolution of governance. Our results can be separated into two parts. (1) From past to present, examining how governance institutions and collective action have emerged from strong social networks. (2) From present to future, how these social networks are being undermined as the foundation for the island's governance institutions that they created, due to growth and changing social-ecological conditions. This article draws on Evolutionary Governance Theory (EGT) as an overarching frame to examine the linkages between social networks and collective action, looking specifically at the role of multi-level governance, institutional change, path dependencies and discourse analysis.

Water: Drought, Crisis and Governance in Australia and Brazil	WATER			English	Article						water governance; drought; water crisis; Australia; Brazil; climate change	RESOURCES MANAGEMENT; SOUTHEAST AUSTRALIA; MILLENNIUM DROUGHT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RIVER-BASIN; LESSONS; GROUNDWATER; ENGAGEMENT; QUEENSLAND; POLITICS	Despite huge differences in population, household income and development levels, Australia and Brazil have some temporal convergences in their water governance systems. Over the last 20 years, both countries have significantly reformed their water policies and practices by introducing a legal foundation for more integrated and participatory catchment/basin management based on the best information available. A critical test of any water reform is how effective it is in meeting the challenges of extreme and unpredictable conditions of drought and floods, which are expected to increase under climate changes scenarios. This paper compared the contemporary water governance frameworks of Australia and Brazil in relation to three elements of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM): integration, participation, and information/knowledge. We focused on insights from Brazil's recent drought and Australia's fluctuating water crises to derive lessons and recommendations for future changes. Among the main recommendations, we stress the need for both systems to improve effective participation and to embrace a more comprehensive approach to cope with water scarcity in future scenarios. Furthermore, water related decisions should be based on a transparent and well informed process, and take into account the lessons from similar situations worldwide in order to avoid unnecessary or ineffective measures. As demonstrated in the Australian case during the Millennium Drought, the most effective initiatives were those involving government, the private sector and society to achieve a more sustainable consumption pattern in all sectors. There is much to learn from the Brazilian and Australia experiences in water reforms and crises, but it is imperative to understand the social, economic and environmental context within which these took place. Continuing to develop the capacity and willingness of researchers and policy makers to work together can make an important contribution towards meeting the growing and spreading challenges in water resource management around the world.

We show that China eschewed participatory modes of energy governance and pursued a centrally steered, hard interventionist strategy adapted to its non-democratic regime. We observe that China's approach provides an alternative blueprint for development that is potentially attractive to some audiences. Drawing on recent soft power debates, we argue that China's hard interventionist mode of governance in the renewables sector has the potential to enhance Chinese soft power both domestically and abroad.

J	Basupi, LV; Dougill, AJ; Quinn, CH				Basupi, Lenyeletse Vincent; Dougill, Andrew John; Quinn, Claire Helen			Institutional challenges in pastoral landscape management: Towards sustainable land management in Ngamiland, Botswana	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						comanagement; institutions; pastoralism; policy analysis; rangelands	COMMUNAL AREAS; COMANAGEMENT; GOVERNANCE; IMPACTS; AFRICA; POLICY	Policies, institutions, and governance structures have implications for the sustainable use of land resources. In dryland Africa, pastoral landscapes are faced with challenges of land degradation, livestock diseases, droughts, and land use conflicts. In order to enhance resilience and integrity of pastoral societies and landscapes, sustainable land management (SLM) requires that policies and institutions create an enabling environment that encourages sustainable use. This study analyses current policy, institutional, and governance challenges in relation to SLM in Ngamiland, Botswana. We use a series of expert interviews, local stakeholder workshops, document, and policy content analysis to analyse policy and institutional challenges. Key findings of this study include fragmented institutional and policy frameworks, conflicting policies and priorities, weak governance structures, lack of integrated planning and coordination between sectors, gaps in communication, knowledge gaps, and fragmented pastoralists lobbying institutions, all of which hinders prospects for SLM in communal areas of Botswana. Harmonisation of sectoral policies requires institutional and policy design to consider institutional coordination and enhanced learning on other actors' perspectives and constraints. Findings in Ngamiland show that collaborative comanagement approaches can play a role in facilitating intersectoral data sharing to enable successful development of pastoral landscapes and a supportive decision-making system for SLM.

J	Stacey, P; Grant, R; Oteng-Ababio, M				Stacey, Paul; Grant, Richard; Oteng-Ababio, Martin			Food for thought: Urban market planning and entangled governance in Accra, Ghana	HABITAT INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Marketplace; Governance; Uncertainty; Institutions; Urban; Ghana		The Konkomba Yam Market in Accra, Ghana, is one of West Africa's largest agricultural markets. This article undertakes a multi-dimensional analysis focusing on contests between unsuccessful government efforts to relocate the market, and local efforts to remain in place, culminating in indeterminacy. Publicly, the relocation debate pivots around competing rationales: those of government driven 'market' and 'formal' logics versus locally-based 'rights' and 'informal' urban governance. Conceptually, the article highlights how the imbroglio around the failed relocation is driven and perpetuated by both antagonistic and productive relationships between different formal and informal actors and institutions. Empirically, the case draws attention to how urban policy omissions of contextual socio-political and economic interests and power relations result in the informalisation of urban governance.

J	Walker, G				Walker, Gordon			The role for 'community' in carbon governance	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article							RENEWABLE ENERGY; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; WIND POWER; POLICY; ACCEPTANCE; INNOVATION; ENGLAND	The notion of community-based activity has increasingly been enrolled within carbon governance discourses and programs of recognized and supported activity. Community is a term used in various ways, to distinguish an actor, a scale of activity, a spatial setting, a form of network, and a type of process through which carbon reduction objectives can be implemented. In this review the various expectations linked to community-based initiatives are identified and discussed in relation to the range of meanings of community in carbon governance. Working through and with communities is typically expected to better embed individual behavior change, as well as generate social innovations and facilitate the consensual deployment of sustainable energy technologies. Research into the experience of implementing community renewable energy projects is discussed to explore the challenges involved in realizing such outcomes. (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Fan, MF				Fan, Mei-Fang			Stakeholder Perceptions and Responses to GM Crops and Foods: the Case of Taiwan	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						stakeholder engagement; risk; GM crops; sustainable development; precaution	SCIENCE	Many societies face-the problem of how to cope adequately with new inventions and technologies. Many are now in the middle of debates about GM crops and foods. This paper examines how stakeholders in Taiwan perceive GM crops and foods and the implications of these perceptions for risk governance and sustainable development. The research utilizes documentary analysis, data gathered from in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. It shows civil groups' unease about unknown consequences, skepticism of the relations between politics and business, and criticisms of the failure by the government and the media to inform the public. It highlights Christian and Buddhist responses to GM issues, because elements of these religious groups have devoted themselves to public awaking for a sustainable society. It argues for the need to promote informed public deliberations and stakeholder debates on decisions about GM technology and the establishment of alliances for dealing with GM controversies and promoting sustainable development.

GLOBAL GOVERNANCE			English	Article						Global Compact; development; United Nations; multilateralism; public-private partnerships		The UN Global Compact epitomizes the current state of the politics of international development in three distinct ways. First, the Compact illustrates a major turn in development thinking. After decades of hostile relations, the UN and business now acknowledge their common interest in the promotion of sustainable development. Second, the Compact brings to light the gradual emergence of more inclusive forms of global governance, in response to the failure of traditional mechanisms of development cooperation. Third, ongoing discussions about the Global Compact attest to the competing worldviews that structure today's development debate. Overall, the Compact demonstrates that, beyond its ever changing dynamics, international development ultimately remains a political, rather than a technical, process.

Ordinary land grabbing in peri-urban spaces: Land conflicts and governance in a small Colombian city	GEOFORUM			English	Article						Urban land grabbing; Environmental governance; Policy coherence; Agriculture; Peri-urban space; Colombia	LATIN-AMERICA; URBAN; CHALLENGES; POLICY; CITIES; SUSTAINABILITY; TERRITORIAL; MANAGEMENT; SECTOR	Emerging scholarship on urban land grabbing has urged researchers to take more nuanced perspectives on land appropriation. There is the need to understand the actions of and interactions amongst a multiplicity of local actors-beyond large-scale investors and global cities-when considering land grabs in the spaces of urban development. Therefore, this paper analyses what we conceptualise as the more 'gradual' and 'ordinary' dynamics of land dispossession in the peri-urban spaces of the small-scale city of Sogamoso, Colombia. Based on 38 semi-structured key-informant interviews, we explore everyday actions, actors and power relations involved in urban expansionism, mining, farming and ecosystems conservation as these activities seek to coexist and compete for the same, relatively sparse amount of peri-urban space. We find that land appropriation is facilitated by multi-level policy incoherence and the failures of municipal governance. Policy incoherence results in normative uncertainty and weak environmental governance, while a lack of coordinated municipal governance in peri-urban spaces leads to further small scale, 'ordinary' and therefore 'invisible' conflicts, to the detriment of citizens' livelihoods. This paper contributes to understanding spatially differentiated urban land appropriation, and its articulation with local, gradual, subtle and more hidden land use conflicts, governance regimes and power relations at the scales of the everyday. Our findings suggest the need to theorize urban land grab also as a result of ordinary, place-based, quotidian dynamics that emerge from governance problematics, including policy incoherence, and land use conflicts, and from the intersection of a more diverse set of drivers, mechanisms and actors than discussed in the extant literature with focus on large urban centres.

The purpose of the project is to restore local streams in Incheon for improvement of ecological restoration, water quality, flood prevention, and waterfront amenities for local residents. The project epitomizes the ethos of river governance through accommodation of views from various stakeholders, such as the government, nongovernmental organizations, local residents, and experts through establishment of the Stream Restoration Propulsion Group (SRPG). The enactment of the Special Ordinance for the SRPG has served to help the governance system work in the project. The interim assessment of the project in terms of river governance and ecological restoration indicates that the project has achieved a good degree of river governance coupled with a limited range of ecological restoration. The key to the success of the project hinges upon a continuous collaboration between the stakeholders to achieve river restoration, particularly political bargaining between the government and the other stakeholders.

J	Castro-Spila, J; Torres, R; Lorenzo, C; Santa, A				Castro-Spila, Javier; Torres, Rosa; Lorenzo, Carolina; Santa, Alba			Social innovation and sustainable tourism lab: an explorative model	HIGHER EDUCATION SKILLS AND WORK-BASED LEARNING			English	Article						Work-based learning; Social innovation; Sustainable tourism; Agile research	ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; VULNERABILITY; GOVERNANCE; EDUCATION; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to devise an experimental lab like infrastructure in the higher education connecting social innovation with sustainable tourism. Design/methodology/approach In order to model a laboratory of social innovation and sustainable tourism lab (SISTOUR-LAB), the method of agile research was employed. This method involves the creation of successive and accumulative prototypes of four kinds: conceptual, relational, functional and transferable. Thus, agile research enables the integration of different social perspectives into the same prototype in a recursive manner. Findings The SISTOUR-LAB is a work-based learning strategy that allows for the development of a mapping process on tourism vulnerabilities (linked to opportunities for social innovation); the development of experimental training in prototyping social innovations on sustainable tourism; the design of hybrid social innovation business models linked to sustainable tourism; and the development of a relational model of evaluation linking together social innovation competencies with processes of transition toward sustainable tourism. Research limitations/implications The SISTOUR-LAB is a prototypical lab that combines social innovation and sustainable tourism in an experimental setting. The SISTOUR-LAB has been modeled based on the agile research method, but it will be necessary to test it empirically to stabilize the model. Once stabilized, the model shall lead to a better understanding of the relationship between work-based learning, social innovation and sustainable tourism in the area of higher education. Practical implications The SISTOUR-LAB has four implications: teachers: the SISTOUR-LAB provides teachers with a setting for the development of experimental education models that connect the problems of conventional tourism with social innovation in order to foster new learning environments oriented toward sustainable tourism; students: the SISTOUR-LAB enhances the employability of students since it connects them with agents and demands of touristic transition, while also fostering entrepreneurial development by means of improving the acquisition of social entrepreneurship competences for sustainable tourism; organizations: the SISTOUR-LAB provides an experimental setting for the prototyping of social innovations so as to assist organizations in the formulation of models, prototypes and evaluations that facilitate the transition toward sustainable tourism; policymaking: the SISTOUR-LAB promotes the design of evidence-based public policies, which fosters inclusive models of innovation and the regional monitoring of transitions toward sustainable tourism. Originality/value There exist little reference to the link between social innovation and sustainable tourism in the academic and institutional literature. The SISTOUR-LAB is a work-based learning strategy that fosters the structuring of experimental relations between social innovation and sustainable tourism by integrating touristic organizations to the development of competencies in higher education. The SISTOUR-LAB has programmatic and prospective value. It can be considered as a guide for the development of generative competencies, i.e. competencies that generate social innovations that impact chain triggers transitions toward sustainable tourism.

This paper explores an empirical evidence for the relationship binding ESG scores and sustainability performances of firms. We observe and evaluate the ESG performance scores of 1,820 firms globally for 5 years, from 2014 to 2018 on 10 major themes and over 400 different indicators, as listed by Thomson Reuters and is captured from the Bloomberg terminal data. We posit five hypotheses to check the relations binding ESG scores and the total sustainability performances of firms. A Partial Least Square (PLS) analysis and standard bootstrapping using Smart PLS 3.0 software is used to observe the results and to evidence the direct and moderating effects among latent variables contributing to sustainability performances. We observe a significant and negative moderating effect of ESG performances, independently over the all direct relations, considering their relationship to ESG performances. One of the major implications of this research is in the direction of assigning priorities while considering environmental-, social-, and governance-related themes in the implementation of any strategies or policies into practice.

J	Mah, DNY; Mills, P				Mah, Daphne Ngar-yin; Mills, Peter			Central-local Relations and Pricing Policies for Wind Energy in China	CHINA REVIEW-AN INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL ON GREATER CHINA			English	Article							RENEWABLE ENERGY; GOVERNANCE; COUNTRIES; REFORMS	Renewable energy, although capable of making a significant contribution to the achievement of sustainable development, has, however, failed to reach its full potential in most countries. A major challenge of the sustainability transition is how to translate sustainable development from a concept to effective implementation. However, the mechanisms through which the concept of sustainable development can be put into operation remain an area largely unexplored in the energy sector, and particularly so in the Chinese context. In an attempt to bridge this knowledge gap, our article draws on the linkages between theories of central-local relations and governance. It applies these theories in an examination of two pricing policies for wind energy in China, namely the tendering policy (a policy of price liberalization) and the fixed-price policy (a policy of price regulation). This paper argues that although either liberalizing the market or regulating the price of wind energy has brought some positive effects to the diffusion of this renewable energy source, the interactions between the interdependent actors within the established fabric of central-local relations have created new tensions and problems, These help explain why both market coordination and administrative coordination have failed to steer society towards the collective goal of facilitating the diffusion of wind energy. A possible alternative pricing policy - a national fixed-price policy with provincial variations in premiums would, in our view, be more likely to facilitate the development of wind energy in China. The alternative pricing policy underscores the importance of a more sophisticated strategy which would require are configuration of central-provincial relations through renewed state price regulation coupled with delegation.

J	Oedl-Wieser, T; Hausegger-Nestelberger, K; Dax, T; Bauchinger, L				Oedl-Wieser, Theresia; Hausegger-Nestelberger, Kerstin; Dax, Thomas; Bauchinger, Lisa			Formal and Informal Governance Arrangements to Boost Sustainable and Inclusive Rural-Urban Synergies: An Analysis of the Metropolitan Area of Styria	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						rural-urban linkages; city-regions; rural-urban partnerships; relational space; living labs; regional development agency	CITY-REGIONS; POLICY	In the past, the contrasts between rural and urban regions were the primary feature of analysis, while today, spatial dynamics are realized by the interactions between spaces and focus on the dependencies of rural-urban areas. This implies that boundaries are not anymore perceived as fixed but as flexible and fluid. With rising spatial interrelations, the concept of the "city-region" has been increasingly regarded as a meaningful concept for the implementation of development policies. Governance arrangements working at the rural-urban interface are often highly complex. They are characterized by horizontal and vertical coordination of numerous institutional public and private actors. In general, they provide opportunities to reap benefits and try to ameliorate negative outcomes but, due to asymmetric power relations, rural areas are often challenged to make their voice heard within city-region governance structures which can too easily become focused on the needs of the urban areas. This paper addresses these issues of rural-urban partnerships through the case of the Metropolitan Area of Styria. It presents analyses on the core issue of how to recognize the structure and driving challenges for regional co-operation and inter-communal collaboration in this city-region. Data were collected through workshops with regional stakeholders and interviews with mayors. Although the Metropolitan Area of Styria occupies an increased reference in policy discourses, the city-region has not grown to a uniform region and there are still major differences in terms of economic performance, the distribution of decision-making power, accessibility and development opportunities. If there should be established a stronger material and imagined cohesion in the city-region, it requires enhanced assistance for municipalities with less financial and personal resources, and tangible good practices of inter-municipal co-operation. The ability to act at a city-regional level depends highly on the commitment for co-operation in the formal and informal governance arrangement, and on the willingness for political compromises as well as on the formulation of common future goals.

J	Daamen, TA; Vries, I				Daamen, Tom A.; Vries, Isabelle			Governing the European port-city interface: institutional impacts on spatial projects between city and port	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY			English	Article						Port-city interface; Port development; Institutionalism; Governance; Spatial projects	GOVERNANCE	Sustainability agendas are challenging port authorities around the world to find ways to use port assets more efficiently and productively in economic, social, as well as environmental terms. To this end, one of the most strategic port assets is the port-city interface - waterfront zones in which the geography of the port and its city meet each other. In this paper, we explore the relationship between the institutions and governance processes behind spatial projects currently taking place in the interface of four European port cities: Marseille, Barcelona, Hamburg, and Rotterdam. Results show that laws and regulations dominate the spatial outcomes of governance processes between city and port, and that these tend to frustrate experimental efforts towards truly sustainable results. In addition, development orientations that foresee an on-going port migration process away from the urban core are still common among urban planning and policy makers, which impedes on the joint governance processes needed for building renewed, sustainable port-city relations and spatial projects. Contours of such a joint governance process have only been found in the Rotterdam case. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Maguire, K				Maguire, Kelly			An examination of the level of local authority sustainable planning for event management: a case study of Ireland	JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM			English	Article						Sustainable planning; event management; event planning; local authorities sustainable planning tool-kit	SOCIAL IMPACTS; TOURISM; GOVERNANCE; PROVISION; FESTIVALS	The growth of the events industry will continue to place increasing demands on the environmental and social resource base upon which events depend. Although Local Authorities have a long-running commitment to achieving sustainable development, there exist many gaps in relation to its application within the context of planning for events management. In the current event environment there is a fundamental need for a sustainable approach to planning for events by Local Authorities, given their often statutory responsibility to license events and to facilitate and regulate the process of planning for large-scale outdoor public events. This research employed a multi-methodological approach utilising a content analysis of Local Authority event management plans and interviews with Local Authority event personnel. The findings report significantly low levels of Local Authority sustainable planning for event management in Ireland and point to the need for a consistent, transparent and state-wide sustainable approach to planning for events in Ireland. The lessons learned from this study may have implications for event destinations at international level. This study suggests a possible solution for Local Authorities to effectively lay the foundation for a transition towards greater levels of sustainable planning for events management going forward.

A number of distinct, and sometimes conflicting discourses have emerged in relation to the Blue Economy, which are distinguished by the degree to which they prioritize different development objectives. This paper explores the range of Blue Economy interpretations, governance strategies and implementation approaches that exist across Commonwealth countries. Key Blue Economy policy statements and governance instruments are analysed in order to ascertain the way the Blue Economy is being institutionalized at a national level, with reference to the Sustainable Development Goals and the Commonwealth Blue Charter. High-level Blue Economy objectives appear to prioritize economic and environmental objectives, with limited engagement with equity objectives including food security and gender equality. Blue Economy objectives are primarily being institutionalized through a diverse array of strategies, plans and policies with limited information on mechanisms for implementation. Finally, there are signs that the Blue Economy may be facilitating a greater degree of integration across sectoral management, with the emergence of range of boundary-crossing arrangements in a number of the countries examined.This article is part of the theme issue 'Nurturing resilient marine ecosystems'.

With the analysis of global water policies and their implications in the Southeast-Asian context, the objectives of this work are to (a) reveal the scalar nature of Hanoi's water infrastructures by situating water management processes in a broader context of developmental issues, and (b) review lessons and prospects of past and future global targets of access to safe drinking water. The evidence of multilevel water governance processes and cross-sectoral challenges of safe water provision emphasizes the need for global networks of cooperation to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 6 and contribute to other sectors aiming to "transform our world."

J	Zanella, MA; Goetz, A; Rist, S; Schmidt, O; Weigelt, J				Zanella, Matheus Alves; Goetz, Ariane; Rist, Stephan; Schmidt, Oscar; Weigelt, Jes			Deliberation in Multi-Stakeholder Participation: A Heuristic Framework Applied to the Committee on World Food Security	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						deliberation; multi-stakeholder; participation; food security; sustainable development; global governance	DEMOCRATIC-THEORY; GLOBAL GOVERNANCE; POLITICS; SOVEREIGNTY; PARTNERSHIPS; INNOVATION; AUTHORITY; STATE; POWER	Multi-stakeholder participation (MSP) has become a central feature in several institutions and processes of global governance. Those who promote them trust that these arrangements can advance the deliberative quality of international institutions, and thereby improve the democratic quality, legitimacy and effectiveness of both the institutional landscape, as well as decisions made within it. This paper employs a heuristic framework to analyze the deliberative quality of MSP. Specifically, it applies Dryzek's deliberative systems framework to the case of the Committee on World Food Security (CFS). The assessment shows that the CFS improves the deliberative quality of food security governance by including and facilitating the transmission of discourses from the public to the empowered spaces. However, the deliberative quality of CFS could be higher with stronger accountability mechanisms in place, more meta-deliberation and adoption of CFS outcomes at national and local levels. Reflecting on the limitations of using this heuristic framework to assess MSP, we conclude that the analysis would benefit from more explicit consideration of different forms of power that are part of the social relations between actors involved in such settings. By proposing this analytical approach, we expect to advance a heuristic framework for assessing deliberation in an international context of the growing importance of MSP in sustainability and global governance.

Sustainable aquaculture in Canada: Lost in translation	MARINE POLICY			English	Article						Sustainability indicators; Aquaculture; Community-level; Certification schemes; Blue growth	SOCIAL LICENSE; SALMON AQUACULTURE; INDICATORS; FISHERIES; GOVERNANCE; FISH; REVOLUTION; IMPACTS; TOOLS	Canada is a signatory to United Nations conventions on sustainable development and has entrenched sustainability goals in legislation and policies relating to natural resource sectors including aquaculture. Monitoring and measuring progress towards sustainable development requires the development of sustainability indicators (SI) that, when measured, indicate movement towards or away from a stated policy objective, as well as providing the public with a measure of government accountability. This paper examined the SI used by the Canadian government to assess the social, economic and environmental sustainability of aquaculture production in Canada, whether they adequately measure policy outcomes, and whether national-level SI indicators are appropriate to assessing sustainability at the community-level. The analysis reveals that the Canadian government has made virtually no progress towards translating sustainable aquaculture policy aspirations into measurable SI that evaluate policy outcomes. The mismatch between national policy goals and on-the-ground consequences are highlighted in a community case study of finfish aquaculture in Port Mouton Bay (Nova Scotia). Aquaculture SI and sustainability narratives are discussed in relation to emergent governance arrangements (certification programs) and an international development initiative, Blue Growth, for the world's oceans.

J	Winkler, H; Dubash, NK				Winkler, Harald; Dubash, Navroz K.			Who determines transformational change in development and climate finance?	CLIMATE POLICY			English	Article						climate change; development aid; assistance; governance; Green Climate Fund; mitigation; transformational change	PROJECTS; CDM	The language of transformational change is increasingly applied to climate policy, and particularly in climate finance. Transformational change in this context is used with respect to low-carbon development futures, with the emphasis on mitigation and GHG metrics. But, for many developing countries, climate policy is embedded in a larger context of sustainable development objectives, defined through a national process. Viewed thus, there is a potential tension between mitigation-focused transformation and nationally driven sustainable development. We explore this tension in the context of operationalizing the Green Climate Fund (GCF), which has to deal with the fundamental tension between country ownership and transformational change. In relation to climate finance, acceptance of diverse interpretations of transformation are essential conditions for avoiding risk of transformational change becoming a conditionality on development. We further draw lessons from climate governance and the development aid literature. The article examines how in the case of both the Clean Development Mechanism and Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions, there has been limited success in achieving both development objectives and nationally appropriate' mitigation. The development aid literature points to process-based approaches as a possible alternative, but there are limitations to this approach.Policy relevanceThe concept of transformational change has gained prominence in climate finance. The conundrum facing the GCF is that it seeks to support transformational change in the climate realm, in a context where countries may have competing priorities. Balancing or even transcending this tension is a fundamental design challenge for the GCF. A primary focus on mitigation, particularly if metrics of performance are tied exclusively to GHG reduction, raise concerns about diluting ownership by recipient countries and evokes concerns of conditionality or worse. The literature on development assistance has explored options notably conditions on process and adequate capacity, and suggests that there are no short cuts to building domestic ownership. Actors on climate change need to avoid the risk that transformational change is perceived as, and becomes, an imposed condition. The risk that transformation change, operationalized in the context of unequal power relations, becomes an imposition on development, needs to be avoided.

This study aims to analyze and discuss the approach taken by the tripartite policy network of actors, namely FIFA, Qatar's Supreme Council (SC), and the Local Organizing Committee (Q22) for the creation of the the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 Sustainability Strategy (hereafter WCSS22) published in January 2020. The WCSS22 represents the first time FIFA has clearly articulated its responsibility in connection with impacts that are linked to the construction and operation of World Cup stadia and facilities, in line with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs). The strategy was also the first to be planned and delivered jointly by FIFA, the SC, and the Q22. Qualitative Content Analysis (QCA) of documents associated with the WCSS22 was performed to answer the following research questions: a) What are the recurrent features of the policy formulation and design process and what role do the UNGPs play? b) How do FIFA and the other policy actors contribute and position themselves in relation to human rights? c) What form did governance (interdependence, interactions, regulated rules, and steering) take in the policymaking process? The study establishes that there are four recurrent features of policy formulation and design: 1) a collective, systematic, and diverse policymaking approach, 2) emphasis on leveraging internal resources and external input, 3) the building foundation of best practice principles, guidelines, strategies, and existing initiatives, and 4) inconsistency on decision-making and accountability measures. FIFA contributes to policymaking primarily through their existing statutes, human rights policy, and commitments to mitigate negative human rights impacts. Furthermore, specified actions, and mechanisms for construction workers' living and working conditions and recruitment processes are articulated by the SC, who take a more prominent role in worker initiatives. Q22, although involved in collective action, and participating in workers welfare, takes a more peripheral role in the policymaking process. In conclusion, it was found that the tripartite policy network of actors represents a participant-based governance approach with cohesive policy formulation, varied resources at their disposal, inconsistencies in accountability measures and with the lead network role dependent on specific actor initiatives and commitments.

The disadvantage or loss of these features in organizing the companies, leads to significant lagging of the company in relation to its competitors and the continuous weakening of economic power can lead to the collapse, which is the hardest blow to the investors but also the recognition of the manager that he was not successful.

Methodology/approach - The analysis synthesizes the findings of a review of 20 such initiatives. It draws on a wide body of literatures and conceptual insights to understand the emergence of these new approaches to international business regulation. The assessment of their emergence, performance, and impacts highlights the complex dynamics of regulatory change. Findings - The findings caution against simple generalizations about the positive or negative outcomes of these new forms of collaborative governance. Their somewhat mixed record can be partly explained by the diverse set of interests, preferences, and agendas of the actors involved; variations in institutional learning, capacities, and power relations; as well as how such initiatives are nested in broader institutions and structures. This points to the need, raised in the conclusion, for intellectual pluralism in advancing knowledge of the effectiveness of new regulatory institutions. Originality and value - The analysis aims to go beyond studies that (i) tend to focus on just one or a few cases; (ii) that ignore the implications of such initiatives for development in the Global South; and (iii) draw on narrow bodies of theory and literature to understand complex issues.

Even before the drought, the city's relation to water was complex; South Africa still struggles with the legacy of racial inequality including its implications for water justice. Spatial and economic segregation of people initiated when Europeans first settled in the Cape culminated during the apartheid era 1948-1994. It forcibly moved hundreds of thousands of "colored" and "black" Capetonians to inferior housing in low-lying areas prone to flooding and with limited access to water, sanitation, and other services. Post-1994 policies have aimed to promote water justice for all citizens, but municipalities have struggled with implementation especially in rapidly growing informal settlements. During the recent drought, the City of Cape Town ramped up its program for water demand management, including pressure reduction, leak repairs, and public awareness-raising campaigns. However, poor communication and a lack of trust contributed to a near-panic situation at the threat of "Day Zero" as dams almost ran dry in the first half of 2018. Saved by winter rains, Cape Town is now exploring additional water sources and developing a new Water Strategy. Taken together, the City's experiences demonstrate that sustainable water governance needs to acknowledge the interrelated threats of drought and flooding, and the range of impacts these threats as well as the City's responses have on a population still defined by extreme inequality.

Protected area may be an area of land and/or sea dedicated to the protection and maintenance of biological diversity, and of natural and associated cultural resources, and managed through legal or other means. It might have many different purposes. This means that biodiversity protection, though a critically important function is far from being the only purpose and is often not the primary purpose of many protected areas. As an ever-growing activity, tourism in protected areas produces benefits and cost that often interact in complex ways. Therefore, it is obvious that special attention has to be paid to the protected areas governance model and its effectiveness, especially in terms of the planning and control process enhancement for the purpose of avoiding possible conflicts over nature protection and tourism development. This paper focuses on the analysis of problems that protected areas are facing in relation to tourism development, in particular from the Croatian protected areas' point of view (specifically, national parks and nature parks). Additionally it offers some recommendations concerning possible environmental management strategies, specifically those related to visitor management, whose tools ought to be implemented in order to keep both the protected areas' system and tourism development sustainable. These recommendations are to be discussed from the prospective of the new governance system implementation that might help in achieving the sustainability goals of Croatian protected areas.

JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Environmental governance; Narratives; Private certification; Regulation; Sustainable agriculture; Voluntary programme	VOLUNTARY ENVIRONMENTAL-PROGRAMS; GOVERNANCE; POLICY	Governance mechanisms facilitate sustainability transitions by ensuring that people are engaging in socially and environmentally sound practice. This paper analyses the history of the New Zealand wine industry over the past twenty years to trace how agricultural actors handle regulatory and voluntary modes of environmental governance and navigate between them. The empirical basis for the paper comprises 22 semi-structured interviews with industry actors addressing the 'Sustainable Winegrowing New Zealand' programme. This qualitative methodology facilitated the collection of historical data as well as the interrogation of the meanings interviewees attributed to particular events, practices or behaviours. A narrative analysis examined how interviewees situated themselves in relation with the sustainability programme and their wider environment. The research identifies the key moments that lead the industry to ground its environmentalism in markets, and to coordinate wine production practice through associated auditing. The historical development of the programme suggests that this was achieved through the industry's wholesale adoption of what had been a voluntary programme. The analysis also reveals that diverse actors involved in New Zealand wine production refer to similar intertwining narratives about the programme that demonstrate a shift from a voluntary to a de facto compulsory scheme. We argue that actors have acquiesced to the expansion of the programme, allowing it to shape wine production in New Zealand. In this context, winegrowers and winemakers relate to the sustainability programme as simultaneously a regulatory and a market-motivated form of governance. The findings provide insight to how collective market strategies paired with sustainability assessments can create a new kind of governance mechanism that bridges economic and social spheres.

The Water for Resilience project aimed at equipping poor women, with enhanced income-generating opportunities to overcome poverty and to enhance resilience. This was done by drawing on agro-ecological methodologies, strategies that encourage the use of environmentally sustainable practices such as composting, organic-based pesticides, mulching, and the provision of enhanced water resources. We employed qualitative in-depth interviews, focused group discussions and observation with women beneficiaries and project staff to gather data in four intervention communities. Based on the analysis of the field data, our study shows that the Water for Resilience approach has enormous prospects for reducing poverty and eradicating vulnerability in these deprived settings. We further show that this innovative intervention can promote the transformation of unequal gender relations and empower women. Nonetheless, these can only be achieved if the intervention is executed within a framework that incorporates strategic gender interests, including issues of status relative to men, improved capacity for action, equitable access to household productive resources and access to decision-making and influencing power. We conclude that these structural issues, which remain untouched by this instrumentalist intervention require critical attention if women's empowerment is to achieve meaningful results in the male-centric settings of rural northern Ghana and beyond. We explore lessons to emerge from our analysis for the empowerment of women in these and similar resource-scarce and patriarchal contexts for sustainable development.

The existence of interdependency is a basic premise of governance networks. However, the current debates about governance networks have paid scant attention to how such interdependency actually comes into existence and how network participants can maintain interdependent relations over time. The chapter highlights the differences between the strategies employed by the three municipalities. While two of them resort to highly interventionist methods and participate actively in the dominant governance networks, the third municipality mainly applies hands-off strategies focused on facilitation. The findings show that interdependency is a multifaceted and changeable phenomenon, which different parties can construct and manipulate. In order to do so, institutional designs that facilitate negotiated interaction between the parties are important. The parties must meet in order to explore win-win opportunities. These insights contribute to a better understanding of how municipal actors can contribute to more sustainable development in local communities hosting mining projects.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses a randomly selected sample of 150 non-financial Malaysian listed companies. To find the distinct impact of the code, the paper explicitly divides the sample into two-year pre-context (2010-2011) and two-year post-context (2013-2014) of the code. Besides descriptive statistics, the study also employs correlation and multiple regression estimators. Findings - By comparing the pre-context and post-context of the code, the study found that SL and Bind have a significant positive relation while IC of the board has a significant negative relation with share market price after enactment of the code. Research limitations/implications - The paper has a limitation of using only two years of data due to its non-availability particularly after enactment of the code. The findings show that the new code slightly improved compliance to the CG attributes investigated. Based on findings, the study also recommends further improvement in compliance to CG codes and other voluntary regulations in Malaysia. Originality/value - Besides contributing to the limited and incongruent literature in pre-context and post-context of CG regulations, the paper also provides important insights for regulators and policy makers of the emerging markets like Malaysia.

Contributions to sustainable tourism in small islands: an analysis of the Cittaslow movement	TOURISM GEOGRAPHIES			English	Article						Cittaslow; sustainable tourism; small islands; quality of life; tourism impact	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; SLOW CITIES; RESILIENCE; CONTEXT; PLACES; STATES	The Cittaslow philosophy aims to preserve the unique characteristics of places, people, products, food and the environment. Inclusive participation is the focus of the movement for small communities that aim to improve residents' quality of life and share in one of a kind experiences with visitors. Discussion of the Cittaslow movement has been increasing in recent years, and the conceptualization offered in this paper adds to that discourse by showing how the movement, with its unique approach to sustainability and local governance, has the potential to be beneficial to Small Island Developing States (SIDS) by directly and indirectly contributing to sustainable tourism development. Slow Food, Slow Tourism, and sustainability in relation to tourism are discussed to clarify how they all fit into the slow tourism ethos and influence the Cittaslow movement. Interestingly, by examining some of the essentials of the Cittaslow movement, we can ascertain how the quality of life and experience value of tourism complements the Cittaslow approach to sustainable tourism development for SIDS. Sustainability from an island perspective is conceptualized in the context of the Cittaslow model, and the varying elements that are contributors to sustainable tourism development in SIDS are discussed. These include its marketing potential, environmental and agricultural benefits, as well as the definitive socio-economic advances that may come about from implementing such an initiative. Ultimately, our analysis illustrates the SIDS specific impacts that the strategies of the Cittaslow model facilitate, while it also highlights some of the potential barriers to SIDS seamlessly adopting such a concept.

Other actors have also begun to develop their own initiatives in relation to public matters, and this also applies to the environmental agenda. In this context, this article aims to develop an approach to public sector initiatives aimed at the environment by examining the experiences of the Public Management and Citizenship program database and the recent activities of the Friends of the Amazon Network. The conclusion is that such an approach should consider at least three elements: Transversality - environmental impacts involve different areas of knowledge and governmental action; No Neutrality - understanding environmental impacts involves negotiation in the public arena; Governance - environmental issues require coordination and relationships between different actors.

Such combination can be achieved by engaging stakeholders holding respective resources and power into a rule-structured interaction to orient the collective outcome towards a more favourable end, while the conflicts among actors remain as the governance imperative in the urban renewal arena. This paper aims to elucidate against this background of urban renewal governance and consequences of its resource mobilization by comparing three high-density Asian cities from north to south: Taipei, Hong Kong and Singapore all with a Chinese cultural background. The comparative study investigates the capacity of actors and implications of instrumental tools to mobilize non-state resources in different urban renewal governances. In particular, the assembly of, concession in, incentive for, and transfer of plot ratio, are further accentuated as the said manipulation by public authorities, private sectors, and the community. The findings identify the practical utilities rooted in the manipulation of plot ratios to fuel the redevelopment projects, and highlight that while the mobilization of non-state resources relieves the government deficit of service delivery, the value-laden gover-nance approach and policy instruments for resource mobilization can also strengthen the unbalanced power relations between actors and have consequences on various aspects. As urban governance evolves in response to local and global pressures, the findings in this paper will shed light on the future of urban renewal governance.

Community development in post-Soviet Armenia: The Social Fund model	SOCIAL POLICY & ADMINISTRATION			English	Article						social funds; community-driven development; participation; empowerment; institutional change; governance; post-Soviet transition		The main objective of this article is to discuss the effectiveness of bottom-up, community-driven approaches in promoting community participation and building local capacity within the post-Soviet social, institutional and political context of Armenia. In exploring this issue, the article examines the nature of local participation and social relations in rural communities in Armenia and the impact of the World Bank-supported Armenia Social Investment Fund (ASIF) project on the existing forms of local social organization. One of the objectives of the ASIF project was to promote the participation of local communities in their own economic and social development. The research finds that the project did not change the existing patterns of local social organization and had no significant impact on the nature of participation in the beneficiary communities. Bottom-up, capacity-building interventions that mainly focus on changing patterns of interpersonal social relations may not be effective in fostering sustainable civic institutions without changes in the nature of a country's governance.

Although the practices, discourses and ideologies associated with the sustainable city have been widely disseminated, analyses of sustainable urban development remain surprisingly anodyne. Drawing upon the insights of regulation theory, this paper attempts to develop a critical engagement with the sustainable city as a space of socio-ecological regulation. Focusing upon two examples of sustainable urban development in practice-the first, the struggle over work-place environments in Stoke-on-Trent; and the second, the reinsertion of nature into the Black Country urban region-this paper explores the regulatory geography of the sustainable city and the environmental visions and practices with which it is associated.

Cities, in particular, are emergent actors in global affairs. This paper examines a new type of experiential learning model for this burgeoning local-global governance: academic partnerships with city governments for undergraduate international relations courses. Occidental College and Pomona College have partnered with the Los Angeles Mayor's Office to localize and adopt the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This study focuses on two Spring 2021 Task Force courses, where students worked in consultation with the Mayor's Office to conduct policy research on local implementation of SDG 5 on gender equality. It analyzes the pedagogical value of the Task Force courses with a focus on student learning outcomes and challenges. Through qualitative content analysis of student reflection papers, we find that the courses generate substantial student learning, particularly in higher forms of learning, including development of research and professional skills and metacognitive reflection on "doing theory," or praxis, within the international relations discipline. Further, these partnerships also benefit the city, as they generate valuable data that inform policymaking.

J	Kuzemko, C; Britton, J				Kuzemko, Caroline; Britton, Jess			Policy, politics and materiality across scales: A framework for understanding local government sustainable energy capacity applied in England	ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; MULTILEVEL GOVERNANCE; URBAN SUSTAINABILITY; TRANSITIONS; CITIES; STATE; EXPERIMENTATION; RETHINKING; DEVOLUTION; INNOVATION	Analyses of local climate change governance and sustainable energy transitions have tended to focus on understanding broader governance networks, within which local governments are important actors. Such approaches often make appeals to (lack of) capacity when seeking to understand the many limits to local sustainability programmes, however local government capacity is rarely given a primary analytical focus. We offer a definition of local government sustainable energy capacity, organise it into six types, and explore it in relation to contextual factors across scales: political institutions; energy and climate change policies and material aspects of energy systems. This heuristic framework is applied to case studies of eight local and combined authorities in England, a country with particularly centralised political institutions and energy systems. We conclude that capacity is a useful lens through which to explore the extent to which, and importantly how, local governments can become active sustainability actors. We also find that the development of knowledge capacity is becoming increasingly important; that there is some evidence of political re-scaling in energy; and identify some ways in which material aspects of energy systems have significant implications for local government sustainable energy capacity.

J	Olsson, JA; Brunner, J; Nordin, A; Hanson, HI				Olsson, Johanna Alkan; Brunner, Jonas; Nordin, Amanda; Hanson, Helena, I			A just urban ecosystem service governance at the neighbourhood level-perspectives from Sofielund, Malmo, Sweden	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Environmental justice; Urban areas; Ecosystem service governance; Malmo; Sweden	ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE; GREEN SPACE; PROCEDURAL JUSTICE; STATE; GENTRIFICATION; ACCESSIBILITY; RECOGNITION; FAIRNESS; BARRIERS; POLICIES	The global urban population is increasing and in many urban areas this, combined with densification, create a strain on urban water management and availability of urban green space. Simultaneously, climate change leads to increased frequency and intensity of cloudbursts and hot spells. To counteract experienced problems, cities are increasingly working to improve urban green space through actively including nature-based solutions (NBS) and their related ecosystem services (ES). From an urban sustainable development perspective, it is important to understand where and how to work with NBS and ES, to benefit the whole society. This task of urban ES governance is challenging, especially as the possibilities to work with green space depend on the amount of available space, which varies greatly in and between cities. The aim of the study was to assess how local stakeholders involved in urban development and regeneration processes in a neighbourhood perceive the physical/environmental and social structures, and their interactions in relation to ES provision. The study focuses on actors that directly or indirectly influence the wellbeing of local residents in the district Sofielund in Malmo, Sweden, and is based on semi-structured interviews with 16 stakeholders, including property owners or managers, businesses and local representatives from the Swedish Union of Tenants. The results show that local stakeholder involvement is a key to a just urban ES governance. Without acknowledging different stakeholder perspectives, there is a risk that those with more power and louder voices may steer the urban development in a certain direction, leaving the rest devoid of influence. Approaches to involve local residents exist in Sofielund, both within the local community, housing organizations, as well as a part of the ordinary planning process, but several barriers exist for a more structured participatory culture where the interest of local residents are taken into consideration. Particularly relevant for the interviewed stakeholders, is the identified lack of structure for participation and communication between property owners and the municipality. If the distribution of ES is unequal and participatory structures are lacking, stakeholders will perceive that their interests are not considered. In a short-term perspective, this will create unsatisfaction and decreased trust. In the longer perspective, it may create a degradation of the neighbourhood where economically stronger inhabitants move out. By ensuring, that local inhabitants perceive that their needs of green space are recognized and that a potential uneven distributions of ES provision is considered, it is possible to achieve a more just sustainable urban development. Based on these findings, we make four recommendations on how a just urban ES governance could be developed; social and physical development has to be seen as a whole, power structures have to be recognized, inclusive engagement structures have to be put in place, measurements of ES have to target relative ES provision, related to the needs of differet groups of residents groups.

But how do we ensure adequate participation in governance processes and enable reconciliation between competing goals in relation to sustainability transitions? Transition management highlights the need for participatory and reflexive governance processes to enable sustainability transitions. However, due to participant selection and limitations in chosen approaches, deliberative and participatory forums may have difficulties ensuring justice and legitimacy. A systemic and practice-oriented perspective on deliberation points to the need to widen deliberative activities and analysis on multiple sites, but the connection to transition governance and justice remains weak. In the context of food systems, various movements and networks, such as alternative food networks, food-policy councils, and food-sovereignty movements, work to create a more just and sustainable food system. They form an interesting manifestation for participation in just food governance and can provide new ideas for the development of more equitable governance practices. We analyze studies on civil society participation in food-system transitions to develop understanding of how to improve just transition governance. Based on this investigation, more just sustainability transition governance requires systemic and reflexive deliberation that is also capable of accounting for the role of social movements. There furthermore is a need for institutional arrangements to support this kind of decision making.

Yet research on the sustainability of sand mining has concentrated on extraction rates and socioecological impacts in rivers and coastlines. The potential of active volcanoes to generate a renewable supply of sand through cyclical or intermittent eruptions has been understudied, as have the asymmetrical power relations that animate around this dangerous but financially lucrative industry. This article uses a transboundary political ecology framework to examine the geographically dispersed development interests that drive volcanic sand mining on Mount Merapi, Indonesia's most active stratovolcano. I argue that to make Mount Merapi's volcanic sand trade more sustainable, collaborative forms of environmental governance are needed to bridge critical gaps in knowledge about industry practices that create environmental impacts extending well beyond the volcano's slopes. I develop this argument through three sets of transboundary political ecology themes centered on (1) knowledge boundaries that inform differentiated place-based practices; (2) the transboundary governance dilemma posed by disconnects between upstream mining practices and downstream environmental impacts; and (3) the potential of cross-border governance networks to collaboratively address these policy deficits.

J	Sedlacek, S; Maier, G				Sedlacek, Sabine; Maier, Gunther			Can green building councils serve as third party governance institutions? An economic and institutional analysis	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Green building councils; Prisoners' dilemma; Economic governance	REPUTATION; MARKET	Green Building Councils (GBCs) have been established in many different countries in recent years. This paper discusses the role such organizations can play in the respective construction and real estate industry and under what circumstances a GBC can contribute positively to the development of a "greener" or "more sustainable" stock of buildings. The paper investigates the main informational problem of the industry by looking at the relation between a developer and an investor from an economic point of view. We argue that the investor's uncertainty about the true quality of a building and the corresponding incentive for the developer to cheat may lock them into a prisoners' dilemma trap. The corresponding barriers for a transition toward a "greener" buildings market are analyzed. GBCs are described as institutions of economic governance that can assist the economy in overcoming these problems. They can act as third party institutions in transactions between developers and investors. By certifying the quality of a building, they can reduce the risk for the investor to be cheated by the developer and also increase the incentive to develop good quality buildings for the developer.

The high number of scientific surveys conducted calls for a meta-analysis that integrates multidisciplinary case study results. This secondary case survey analysis offers new insights into the scientific knowledge base on HEI-region relations. Knowledge gaps as well as uncertain, single and cross case verified knowledge could be identified. Whereas the unilateral HEIs' impacts on the region have been broadly analyzed, there still is little knowledge on how to improve the HEIs-region relations. The article discusses the role of HEIs, whichbeing initially perceived as mere location factorevolved to an active actor in the regional innovation and governance system. The article furthermore offers recommendations for policy makers and practitioners on how to use the knowledge gained for the further development of the HEI-region relations but also how to deal with knowledge gaps and context-specific research results.

The Board Capital Theory advocates that the appointment of women directors on board shall enhance various dimensions of the board capital breadth and help in better decision making. With growing consciousness for sustainable practices throughout the globe, it is pertinent to see whether the gender diverse boards can promote corporate social responsibility and create a business case for their upsurge, as it would give room for policy implications. This study investigates the impact of gender diverse boards on promoting corporate social responsibility, using multivariate regression with a sample of NIFTY 50 Index for the period 2014-2019. The study found insignificant positive relation among gender diverse boards and sustainability. To check for the robustness of the study, we have used two diversity indices, Blau & Shannon index, to supplement our results.

They initiate and govern these districts, which act as models for sustainable urban development and testbeds for new sustainability-related policies, using municipally owned land. Public land development in Sweden enables municipalities to include sustainability-oriented negotiable developer obligations in development agreements. The aim of the study is to investigate how Swedish municipalities use sustainability-oriented negotiable developer obligations together with public land development, and to identify what public value outcomes they currently seek to create by using these public value capture instruments. Sustainability-oriented negotiable developer obligations are investigated in relation to municipalities' desired public value outcomes in five sustainability-profiled district developments in different Swedish municipalities. Findings illustrate that Swedish municipalities use negotiable developer obligations to create ecological, social and cultural, political, and economic public value outcomes. This calls for more research investigating different forms of value and value creation in relation to public value capture instruments.

Several cities have already adopted these strategies to support economic development and to provide required post-industrial development. Institutional development is essential for KBUD to gather all of the main actors and sources, to organise and facilitate necessary knowledge-intensive activities and to plan strategically to become KC. Additionally, governing KBUD with institutional leadership make a difference in achieving KC status. Successful urban governance requires understanding of comprehensive planning process. The management of the implementation process is stated to be more important than the preparation of the plan. The success of the implementation is determined by efficiently designed monitoring and evaluation (M/E) systems. To become KC and build the bridge between planning and urban governance, M/E phases need to be incorporated into the planning process. Turkey has been working increasing competitiveness in knowledge economy and developed strategies for increasing knowledge worker capacity, providing an efficient platform for innovation and strengthening institutional leadership. However, the planning system in Turkey includes different governmental bodies with an undefined hierarchy for preparation, implementation and evaluation of the plans. Governing the necessary actions efficiently and institutional leadership seems to be the problematic areas for Turkish cities to become KCs. Case study, Istanbul is a prospect KC. The goal of this paper is to prove that the lack of M/E systems in the planning process prevents a city from becoming a successful KC. Design/methodology/approach - This paper will clarify the planning system in Turkey and hierarchical structure in Istanbul Metropolitan Area. The relation between planning system and urban development management in Turkey will be defined by investigating the current plans and institutions in charge of making and approving plans. The study will analyse Istanbul Metropolitan Area plans' M/E stages. The planning process and M/E existence and applications in the plans are determined by face-to-face interviews with several staff members of governmental entities in Istanbul Metropolitan Area. Originality/value - This paper shows that the lack of M/E processes in the planning system prevents a city to develop effective urban governance and institutional development, and therefore, from becoming a successful KC. Practical implications - This paper aimed to determine the exact stages of Istanbul Metropolitan Area's planning and governance processes that prevent the city from developing as a sustainable KC.

The Governance of Agrobiodiversity	AGROBIODIVERSITY: INTEGRATING KNOWLEDGE FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE	Strungmann Forum Reports		English	Article; Book Chapter								Agrobiodiversity relates to humans and their environments. It is the result of interactions between humans and nature, and thus is simultaneously social and biological by nature. Without humans, agrobiodiversity would not exist. Seeds, as carriers of major agrobiodiversity components, are not mere material objects that exist outside of social relations: they are also sociobiological artifacts embedded in these relations. The multifaceted, highly dynamic realities of agrobiodiversity mean that those interested in questions of governance need to understand the limitations and political implications of the complementary and sometimes contradictory instrumental and relational perspectives on seeds; that is, the understanding of seeds as a production input or as the subject of a social network, in which agrobiodiversity brings together production and social linkages. International instruments aim to provide a legal basis for mediating competing interests and methodologies. In addressing governance, the global framing of these instruments reflects the dynamics of agrobiodiversity in global socioeconomic and environmental changes. From the earliest recognition of the potential value of crop diversity, crop genetic resources were treated as public goods in the public domain. Breeding companies have opposed this treatment. Breeders sought exclusivity and reward for their creative activities in using genetic resources to create novel varieties. Governance of agrobiodiversity-defined by a set of relationships that influences the access to and conservation, exchange, and commercialization of agrobiodiversity-reflects underlying value systems. Conflicting approaches (e.g., "stewardship" vs. "ownership" approaches) toward governance based on divergent value systems and rationales can be distinguished. It is important to identify the actors involved, from local to global, to understand the power dynamics that influence the interactions among these various actors and their ability to influence or control the management of agrobiodiversity. The governance of agrobiodiversity and the power dynamics involved are increasingly crucial in the context of rapidly changing farming and food systems, especially in the context of globalization, migration, and urbanization. This chapter elaborates an emergent research agenda, focusing on aspects of power relations in agrobiodiversity governance, agrobiodiversity and food systems, nutrition, taste and health, and the governance of genetic information.

Deepening democracy for the governance toward just transitions in agri-food systems	ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS			English	Article						Just transition; Agri-food systems; Democracy; Governance; Justice; Sustainability	SUSTAINABILITY TRANSITIONS; INNOVATION SYSTEMS; SOCIAL-SCIENCE; JUSTICE; KNOWLEDGE; PARTICIPATION; POLICY; FRAMEWORK; DEGROWTH; NICHE	In this paper, we explore the relation between democracy and justice in governing agri-food transitions. We argue that a deeper understanding of democracy is needed to foster just transitions. First, we present a multi-dimensional understanding of justice in transitions and relate it to scholarship on democratizing transitions. Then, we argue that three paradigm shifts are required to overcome current unsustainable dynamics: (1) from expert toward pluralist understandings of knowledge; (2) from economic materialism toward post-growth strategies; and (3) from anthropocentrism toward reconnecting human-nature relationships. We explicate what these paradigm shifts entail for democratizing transitions from distributive, procedural, recognition and restorative justice perspectives. Finally, we highlight six challenges to institutionalizing deep democratic governance. These entail balancing tensions between: multiple justice dimensions, democracy and urgency, top-down and bottom-up directionalities, local and global scales, realism and idealism, and roles of incumbent scientific systems. This requires thoroughly rethinking transition studies' normative and democratic ambitions.

Power, REDD plus and reforming forest governance in Indonesia	THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY			English	Article						Power; forest policy reform; REDD plus; Indonesia	MANAGEMENT UNITS; GOVERNMENT; POLICY; DEFORESTATION	This paper analyses the various power relations that shape forest policy and governance reform in Indonesia. It applies Foucault's theories on power to several key initiatives introduced as part of REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation). By analysing both the operation and the effects of power relations the paper accounts for how competing actors influence major policy change, and the impact different policies have on governing multiple forest users. Sovereign and disciplinary power underpins government attempts to implement new regulatory, planning and enforcement functions across the forest estate. Policy instruments such as the concession moratorium create securitised territorial zones that enable sustainable forest practices to operate. By contrast, forest management units operate through inclusive strategies that discipline forest users into responsible managers, whilst enforcement excludes those who contravene the law. Productive power and resistance explain efforts by government and non-government actors to progress or limit REDD+. Productive power operates through the multiple activities that generate new knowledge on incentivising carbon, and by engaging new subjects in carbon projects. Community resistance draws on discourses and localised subjectivities focussed on forest dependency and rights, whereas industry networks have been adept at positioning REDD+ as a threat to national development.

An important instrument to implement this governance strategy is discursive framing. To learn how public authorities use discursive framing to implement a facilitation strategy, we conducted a comparative case study on two Dutch examples in which the government aims to facilitate non-governmental actors to exploit public waterworks for the production of renewable energy. Using content analysis, we identify ten 'facilitation frame' elements. We find two configurations of elements: restrained facilitation and invitational facilitation, which both have their advantages, ambivalences and drawbacks. It is often unclear what governments want to achieve and what they have to offer in terms of facilitation. The (discursively) offered support, ranging from 'giving space' to 'creating beneficial conditions', is often elusive. We conclude that, to avoid deadlock, false expectations and the inactiveness of external actors, the government's communication should both enthuse and inform these actors about what they can expect. If, however, the potential, non-governmental initiators just lack the necessary capacity to act, there is only so much discursive framing can do. Then authorities should reconsider their 'facilitative' role.

Seeding Relations Placemaking through Ecological, Social, and Political Networks as a Basis for Agrobiodiversity Governance	AGROBIODIVERSITY: INTEGRATING KNOWLEDGE FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE	Strungmann Forum Reports		English	Article; Book Chapter								Agrobiodiversity governance is often guided by estimates of countable and measurable objects, from the number and diversity of heirloom seeds or landraces grown in a certain location, to the frequency of seed exchange among actors and rates of disappearance of varieties. Such variables provide important information about conservation status at different scales but do not necessarily capture the dynamic social roles and relationships of seeds and agrobiodiversity to local cultures and communities. This chapter explores (a) the cultural roles of seeds in agrobiodiversity governance as a set of interwoven processes that are mediated by, and which in turn mediate, relationships between people, their practices, and knowledge systems; (b) networks with other people and other species; (c) attachments to cultural landscapes and histories or places; and (d) the broader politics of agriculture and rural development. It argues that relational processes are a necessary part of an analytical framework and crucial for understanding the role that social networks play, at multiple scales, in agrobiodiversity governance, including creating, managing, preserving, or "losing" diversity in the long term.

This chapter covers financing measures for urban transport (including experience with public private partnerships in delivering infrastructure), urban administration and governance, management of transportation systems, the relation of the transportation planning processes to increasing sustainability, and the impact of urban transportation planning on poverty. The topics that were covered by this chapter are complex and require an understanding of multiple perspectives. The chapter demonstrated that an approach that integrates the viewpoints of stakeholders can be expected to be the most sustainable, simply because it reduces conflict and thus manages the cost to society. However, the chapter also demonstrated that the method for bringing about this kind of integration is still a work-in-progress and researchers, administrators and stakeholders should keep an open mind about what can and cannot work.

RFM contributes to greater carbon storage and biodiversity in forest biomass in comparison to conventional logging and deforestation. Using an adjusted von Thunen model to explain land user behavior in relation to different variables, considering a general forest transition curve and looking at a potential relation between governance and deforestation rates, the authors conclude that reduction of deforestation and forest degradation can only be achieved by a combined approach of increasing forest rent relative to other land uses and reducing transaction costs for forest management and conservation. More than providing an additional income for a privileged few, REDD+ will need to address the barriers that have been identified in RFM over the past 30 years of investment in forest management and conservation. Most of these are of an institutional nature, but also culture and social organization as well as locally specific development trends play a significant role in increasing the potential for application of RFM and REDD+.

A notion of 'creative involvement' has been developed to specify an increasingly flexible and pragmatic approach to projecting and managing China's expanding global interests. In this research a close reading of the Declarations and Action Plans of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) over the period 2000-21 reveals specific degrees and types of embedding of Chinese involvement in Africa's complex political economic landscape and an evolving reorientation of development cooperation policy practices shaped by growing concerns with African economic policy and local governance issues.

One of the challenges to local agricultural production is water scarcity. This paper presents a case study of a small-scale, self-organized irrigation governance system in a village in the western Pamirs, applying the concept of "hydrosocial arrangements" to explore its physical and social components and the interactions between them. It concludes that the system has proven sustainable and resilient, largely because of its strong sense of community ownership and its flexibility. Political actors and development practitioners often lack detailed knowledge about such well-functioning local solutions, but external interventions applied without that knowledge risk destroying effective systems that are already in place. It is important to design interventions that are tailored to local needs and based on a comprehensive and well-contextualized understanding of local structures, relations, and values.

This paper explores cases in Los Rios, Chile, to understand how local people living in and near three PPAs viewed impacts of tourism development on human well-being and local governance asking: (1) Why and how do governing PPA actors engage local people in conservation and ecotourism? (2) How do local people perceive the impacts of PPAs? (3) How do perceived impacts differ between PPA ownership types and contexts? We used an Opportunities, Security and Empowerment research framework derived from local definitions of well-being. Results suggest that governing PPA actors (PPA administrations and Chilean government officials) viewed local people as threats to forest conservation goals, embraced exclusion from reserve governance, but encouraged self-governance among local people through educational campaigns promoting environmental stewardship and ecotourism entrepreneurship. PPA administrations avoided emerging participatory democracy approaches to ensure local resistance did not threaten their authority. Despite asymmetrical power relations, PPA-community partnerships were viewed locally as both improving and damaging well-being. Our findings suggest that the social impacts and consequences of PPAs facilitating ecotourism development should be subjected to the same level of scrutiny that has been given to public protected areas.

J	Ray, R; Kamal, R				Ray, Rebecca; Kamal, Rohini			Can South-South Cooperation Compete? The Development Bank of Latin America and the Islamic Development Bank	DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE			English	Article								Southern-led multilateral development banks (MDBs) play a key role in harnessing global capital to finance the sectors most important to borrowers, especially infrastructure. Two prominent Southern MDBs, the Development Bank of Latin America (CAF) and the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB), have become crucial drivers of regional infrastructure growth. This article explores whether their performance has lived up to their goals of establishing borrower control over bank governance without sacrificing financial dynamism. Using power-weighted voting indices for member representation on bank boards, the authors determine that these banks offer borrowers much more representation on their boards than do their Northern-based counterparts, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the World Bank International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). The article also analyses bank operations to determine whether their governance structure impacts their internal performance, as reflected on balance sheets, and external performance - gaining relevance in development finance and particularly in infrastructure lending, including the burgeoning sector of sustainable (climate-resilient) infrastructure. The authors find that the CAF and IsDB have become major players in development finance, including in sustainable infrastructure. However, important issues remain in relation to their continued internal capacity development, especially with regard to the environmental and social safeguards necessary to oversee lending.

Policy Learning and Central-Local Relations: A Case Study of the Pricing Policies for Wind Energy in China (from 1994 to 2009)	ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND GOVERNANCE			English	Article						central-local relations; China; energy pricing; policy learning; wind policy	GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL-POLICY; TECHNOLOGY-TRANSFER; POWER; STATE; DECENTRALIZATION; INCENTIVES; GOVERNANCE	This paper brings together the key concepts of policy learning and central-local relations to examine how the efficacy of sustainability policies can be improved, with a particular reference to pricing policies for wind energy in China. Based on our comparative case studies of three provinces, Guangdong, Shanghai and Xinjiang, we critically examine how central-local relations may facilitate or impede policy learning. Our analysis focuses on policy changes at the national level, including the move away from the tendering policy to a fixed-price policy in 2009, and the diversity of local policy responses, which include a local fixed-price policy in Guangdong, a two-tiered model in Shanghai and a de facto fixed-price policy in Xinjiang. We have three major key findings. First, we found that technical and conceptual forms of policy learning have taken place in China, but the progression towards the highest form of policy learning, social learning, is limited. Secondly, we found that the established fabric of central-local relations has created facilitating conditions for as well as limitations to the advancements towards social learning. A national policy framework, a multi-level governance system, institutional arrangements for knowledge creation and learning, and a more participatory form of governance for civil society are some of the facilitating conditions. However, over-centralization, the inertia against institutional changes and the failure to recognize the need for a more deliberative decision-making process are identified as key barriers.

Specifically, it examines the power asymmetry of governance in the cluster, paying attention to how chain governance has been shaped by both local and national institutional contexts, affecting local firms' upgrading prospects and trajectories of industrial development. It is argued that China's peculiar institutions have shifted the power asymmetry in the mobile game chain in favour of game distributors, allowing them to grab more value than their counterparts in the USA and European Union do. Despite various adaptation efforts made by small developers, they are largely constrained by lead firms with little possibility to move up the chain, which will inhibit further transformation and competitiveness of the industry.

The aims of this paper are (i) to explore public-private partnerships as a tool for economic development of rural economies in developing countries and countries with economies in transition in order to ensure sustainable use of nature and increase public welfare of rural communities through the added value chain; (ii) to develop proposals for the implementation of public-private partnerships on land management and land use in Ukraine. Methodology / approach. The methodological approach involves study of the world's PPP practice in land management and land use (including the use of land in forestry), study of the connections between PPP projects and scientific approaches to the concept of sustainable development and the added value chain, as well as analysis of domestic scientific bibliography, which relate to the subject of this study. Results. The authors found that the declared priorities of the Agenda for Sustainable Development until 2030 require the application of integrated approaches. In particular, the programme in the mechanism of sustainable development management in the form of PPP to ensure sustainable use of nature and increase the social welfare of rural communities. Because the programme approach here involves investing in natural resources and environmental protection and should cover the entire value chain, which directly or indirectly affects the efficiency of natural rural assets, as well as the use and application of innovative technologies. Originality / scientific novelty. It is substantiated that progress in achieving the declared priorities, in particular in the field of environmental protection, growth of public rural welfare, etc. is possible only in a combination of strengths of all PPP partners, which will eliminate the shortcomings and weaknesses of rural communities. In contrast to existing approaches to the development of the land use economy of rural territories, the basis of the synergy of the parties to PPP is a special natural resource - land, which performs environmental, economic, legal and socio-cultural functions, and determines the form and content, which actually builds sustainable development, including rural. A wide range of PPP forms has been further developed, varying in the degree of involvement and risk taken by the private party in relation to the development of the land use economy of rural territories. The approach to the value chains organization in the development of PPP projects on land management and land use and providing security of land use in terms of taking into account the land use of farmers, formed on different rights, has been improved. The author's project PPP in the production of pellets a private investor in lumber logging waste provided by some state-owned enterprise both subject to the extension of the moratorium and without its effect is developed. Practical value / implications. The authors' research shows that the introduction of the value chain in the mechanism of public-private partnership will lead to significant effective changes in the development of the land use economy, in particular of rural territories. Namely, with the use of appropriate policies it will ensure the provision of sustainable use of natural resources and growth of public welfare, in particular rural communities. This approach allows to involve all stakeholders (government, community, business) for effective management of natural assets in general and agriculture	[Tretiak, Anton; Tretiak, Valentina] State Ecol Acad Postgrad Educ & Management, Kiev, Ukraine; [Sakal, Oksana; Kovalenko, Andrii; Tretiak, Nataliia; Shtogryn, Halyna] Natl Acad Sci Ukraine, Publ Inst Inst Environm Econ & Sustainable Dev, Kiev, Ukraine	National Academy of Sciences Ukraine	Tretiak, A (corresponding author), State Ecol Acad Postgrad Educ & Management, Kiev, Ukraine.

The display industry creates remarkable economic output, but every manufacturing process inevitably has some undesirable effects on the environment. With the increasing awareness of environmental protection, balanced development is necessary to address the emerging market trends. However, short-sighted manufacturing corporations that focus solely on financial performance can achieve only short-term profits. The purpose of this study was to develop the most effective sustainable improvement strategies that can enhance competitive advantages in real-world situations. The proposed method combines the balanced scorecard and a new hybrid modified multiple attribute decision-making model which together adopt the DEMATEL technique to construct the influential network relation map and develop the DEMATEL-based ANP with the VIKOR method to deliver strategies that integrate environmental sustainability and competitive advantage. Finally, a real-world case study applying the proposed method to the cases of liquid crystal display manufacturers was conducted. Then, this paper discusses the effective use of natural resources, development of enterprises, and sustainable competitive advantage in this context. Various manufacturers, communities, and stakeholders can benefit from the coopetition solutions explained by the proposed method.

This study examines whether the structural changes observed in various socio-economic dimensions and interdependent spatial levels due to the pandemic crisis are accelerating the emergence of a new phase of global governance. It investigates whether Rodrik's trilemma (the incompatibility of synchronously achieving national sovereignty, democracy and globalization) seems to be relatively inadequate to approach today's emerging global reality and challenges comprehensively. After an elliptic overview of world governance's evolutionary shaping and reaching the present-day necessarily repositioned role of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS), we argue that these countries must no longer be perceived as emerging exceptional cases but as central participants, equally responsible for promoting a more balanced and sustainable development perspective for the less developed socio-economic formations and the entire global socio-economic system's stability. We conclude that in the progressively shaped 'new globalization', which is a distinct evolutionary phase of the international economy and international relations, Rodrik's trilemma seems to some extent analytically insufficient since there is no more a sustainable optimum in any of its coupled dimensions, which could allow a viable exit from the current crisis.

Important challenges will be to set accurate expectations by civil society in relation to UA development, and to find ways to discuss UA in governance and collaboration networks from an aggregate point of view. However, analytical tools that allow comprehensive study of UA initiatives (UAIs) are absent. This article elaborates on a conceptual framework from the COST Action Urban Agriculture Europe (Prove et al. 2015) and evaluates findings that result from applying the framework to four UAIs. We found that, analytically, the framework generates in-depth information on UAIs, and argue that it can be a useful tool in networks that are responsible for collaboration, support, or governance within the UA movement. We also discuss its usability issues and discuss future research.

Research has focused more on evidence of impact on provider institutions than on health systems; little has been published on the determinants of growth or decline of accreditation organizations and programmes. To describe the development of national accreditation organizations in Europe in relation to incentives, funding and market position in 2009; to identify trends over time using data from previous surveys. Contacts in 24 countries, identified by previous surveys, were invited to complete a web-based questionnaire comprising 183 items seeking numerical data or posing multiple choice options. Preliminary results were verified with respondents and agreed for publication. National healthcare environment, incentives, government policy, legislation, regulation; programme governance, development, funding. The survey identified 18 active national accreditation organizations in Europe. Older ones tend to be independent, profession-dominated and self-financing; they have shown little growth in activity and coverage of the potential market. Newer ones have broad stakeholder governance, support from government policy and growth sustained by legal or financial incentives-giving wide coverage across the healthcare system. The traditional collegial model of accreditation is moving towards a semi-regulatory model of external assessment which could integrate minimal standards of licensing, public safety and accountability with aspirational standards for organizational development and improvement. The principal challenges to sustainable accreditation appear to be market size, consistency of policy support, programme funding and financial incentives for participation.

Moreover, this study identifies the critical drivers of corporate sustainability by focusing on the levels of market developments and geographical regions. Design/methodology/approach Based on corporate sustainability data of 2,725 global companies in 2016, this study uses a combination of analytical techniques including cluster analysis, data mining, partial least square path modeling and importance performance map analysis. Findings This study finds that companies in European developed markets exhibit the highest-ranking of corporate sustainability. In line with the social impact hypothesis, environmental, social and governance performance positively affects economic performance. Moreover, there is strong evidence of causal relationships and synergistic effects among the four pillars of corporate sustainability. In accordance with the institutional theory, the patterns of causal directions and the critical pillars depend on levels of market developments and geographical regions. Overall, social and environmental pillars are among the most critical drivers of corporate sustainability. Research limitations/implications - The methodology does not aim to provide a new weighting scheme for calculating the corporate sustainability index. Practical implications - Corporate managers should consider sustainability practices in all dimensions to benefit from synergistic effects among environmental, social, governance and economic activities. Furthermore, corporate sustainability strategies should not be generalized across countries with different levels of market developments and geographical regions. Originality/value This study prioritizes environmental, social, governance and economic pillars of corporate sustainability in emerging and developed markets across geographical regions.

Challenges caused by lack of financial aids, salaries gap and a very masculine model avoid a better gender balance in the business graduate schools, which, globally, should lead women personal and professional development. The main objective of this research is to analyse business schools communication priorities related to gender equality projects and policies in their sustainability reports, considering these as a fundamental tool for corporate legitimacy. Through a content analysis of the sustainable reports of the top 50 business schools of the world, we elaborate a Codes Frequency Report focusing on Goal 4: quality of education (in relation with scholarships and grants allocation) and Goal 5: gender equality and we explore the correlations with the schools' ranking positions, the price of the MBA programmes, the percentage of female MBA students, of female faculty members and women in board of directors in the different geographical areas as Europe, US and Asia. Results show that gender equality related topics are a source of positive impact and legitimacy for top business schools.

J	Chirambo, D				Chirambo, Dumisani			Moving past the rhetoric: Policy considerations that can make Sino-African relations to improve Africa's climate change resilience and the attainment of the sustainable development goals	ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH			English	Review						Climate risk management; Financial inclusion; Food security; Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC); Microfinance; Youth unemployment	DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; FINANCE; CHINA; ENERGY; AGRICULTURE; COMMUNITIES; ADAPTATION; INVESTMENT; GROWTH; AID	Climate change is a threat to the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in sub-Saharan Africa as its impacts can lead to increased incidences of poverty and inequality which can subsequently lead to a 12% decline in the Human Development Index (HDI) for sub-Saharan Africa. Emerging countries such as China have the potential to support Africa to achieve the SDGs by pioneering South-South Climate Finance (SSCF) modalities. In order to increase knowledge on climate informed development and the role of China in global climate governance, the paper examined various research articles, case studies, policy briefs and project reports. Sino-African aid, investments and trade were noted as essential in mitigating Africa's climate change vulnerabilities which induce poverty traps and inequality. Some African countries were noted to have a comparative advantage in environmental standards over China but lacked the initiative to use this comparative advantage to enhance the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) and assist China to have a sustainable growth trajectory. The paper concludes that SSCF modalities can enhance climate risk management in Africa if they focus on improving financial inclusion and improving climate finance flows towards climate change adaptation activities in Africa. Additionally, to increase the effectiveness and impact of Chinese climate finance support to Africa, African policymakers should not allow political and market forces to decide how climate related support from China should be allocated as decisions based on political and market forces could potentially promote an inequitable distribution of funds and ignore the most vulnerable countries and regions.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						water tariff; access to water; shortage; governance; subsidies; less developed countries		This paper examines the relations between tariffs and sustainability, efficiency and equity, using a unique data-set for 308 cities in 102 countries. Higher water tariffs are correlated with lower per capita consumption, smaller local populations, lower water availability, higher demand and a lower risk of shortage. Aggregating to the national level, higher tariffs are correlated with higher GDP and better governance. A different country-level analysis shows that a higher percentage of the population with water service is correlated with better governance, higher GDP and a greater risk of water shortage. The relation between water prices and service coverage is statistically inconsistent.

The resources are typically classified by binaries such as (non-) natural, (non-) rival and (non-) substractable, and the analytical focus is placed on governance for sustainable management. Another approach to the idea of commons emphasises social relations. This concentrates on production resulting from human-human and human-nature interactions. Here, we focus on the latter and investigate the relationship between these two conceptualisations. This is enabled through an empirical study of the development process of a drought-tolerant rice variety, Sahbhagi Dhan, which was the result of a twelveyear long collaboration between the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and other different Indian institutions. We argue that the concept of the common as a production system can be characterised as an interwoven process of community building involved in the production of resource commons, and we indicate several features of the community-building process that are essential to an understanding of commons as a socially specified system of production.

The field of urban studies is yet to deeply engage in the debates on the new forms of cross national networking that are potentially framing and reframing urban governance and strategy. Yet this dimension of urban governance can no longer go unnoticed. In this article we draw together insights from the extant literature into a research agenda on reconfiguring urban governance. We propose a research agenda centred on three themes: the political economy of 'new-gen' networks, especially in relation to the role of economic power in determining participation and influence; the knowledge dynamics in city networks in understanding the socio-spatial configurations that are underpinning the decision-making processes and outcomes; and the implications of city networks for traditional institutions that have in the past shaped cities' strategies, development and government. Our commentary considers and links these emergent themes, noting how these bear serious and urgent consideration for mainstream urban studies.

Recent overviews have highlighted the importance of postharvest developments to sustainable rural livelihoods. For the past half-century most of the postharvest technology implemented in developing countries has been technology transfer from industrialised countries. This was particularly linked to the rise (and subsequent fall) of parastatal marketing boards set up in many countries from the 1950s-especially in newly independent post-colonial countries-with the support of Western donors who funded technologists from organisations such as the forerunners of the Natural Resources Institute and Central Science Laboratory to assist these marketing boards to adapt the postharvest technologies developed in industrialised countries. Some of the technologies have been challenged or made redundant for technical reasons, e.g. pest resistance to insecticides, consumer concerns about additives, and environmental controls on methyl bromide use. However, a major contribution to their demise from the 1980s, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and tropical Asia, was the insistence by many Western donors and investors, led by the World Bank, that these countries adopt programmes of structural adjustment and market liberalisation, including the dismantling of the marketing boards supported by the same donors two to three decades earlier. Though not often labelled as such, this was an early example of the impact of globalisation-in this case in international macroeconomic and development policies-on postharvest systems. More recently, food safety standards and quality assurance requirements are increasingly dominating international and domestic trade in food commodities and food products, and are thus impacting on the potential for producers (especially small-scale farmers) in developing countries to enter these markets. Likewise, international trade liberalisation and information technology-notably in relation to market information and trading opportunities-will have a growing impact on agricultural development in the poorer countries of the world. At a national level, the effectiveness and efficiency of sustainable postharvest systems depend on the quality of governance and civil society, on prevailing economic and political paradigms, on social and cultural value systems, and on civil security. The key point is that none of these issues is driven by available postharvest technology in the conventional sense of storage structures, pest control, drying, processing, etc. Instead they are all aspects of the enabling environment for livelihood improvement, food security, poverty alleviation and quality of life. Only if an appropriate enabling environment exists will the available technologies be adopted and implemented successfully. Many international development programmes and projects in recent years have embraced this philosophy-to the extent that it could be argued that there is now over-investment in enabling actions and under-investment in the technology to deliver improvements. The focus of this overview is on issues in developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. Nevertheless, there are parallels for postharvest systems in industrialised countries: advances in science and technology no longer receive uncritical support, but are often greeted with suspicion, and they are unlikely to be adopted unless they satisfy commercial imperatives, regulatory requirements, public opinion, and current political paradigms. All of us working in the field of stored-product protection need to understand the drivers of the enabling environments for adoption of our research and development outputs if we are to see successful transfer of our technology into action.

To produce cotton, the state imposes output targets on farmers which results in intensified cotton production practices, and consequently in land degradation. Improving degraded croplands via afforestation is an option explored through research experiments in the region, yet is currently not practiced by farmers. Using the example of the Amu Darya River lowlands of Uzbekistan, we analyze afforestation and its implementation constraints, by developing a coevolutionary socio-ecological systems framework that leans on evolutionary economics and evolutionary governance theories. Our study shows that farmers' perceptions and rationalities, in close association with governance configurations of actors, institutions and knowledges, make them unreceptive towards afforestation. Altering relations between agricultural institutions and actors that are currently present in the cotton-centric configuration is difficult given the path-, inter- and goal dependencies. To change rural sustainable development paths, we conclude that the adoption of innovations requires a tailoring of knowledge and technology fitting local situation, as well as the reassembling of relations between actors, institutions and knowledge.

J	Debrie, J; Raimbault, N				Debrie, Jean; Raimbault, Nicolas			The port-city relationships in two European inland ports: A geographical perspective on urban governance	CITIES			English	Article						Port-city relationship; Urban projects; Inland port; Governance	REGIMES	Urban development projects involve some complex relationships between institutional public agents, who govern local territories, and economic agents, who make urban economies. These relationships between the stakeholders of the economic sectors (transport, water, housing, energy, industry...) and the territories shaped by public action thus define the type of urban governance which results from interactions. In this paper, we develop the hypothesis that the relation between these stakeholders has a major impact on the mechanisms that produce the city. In this perspective, we apply an analytical framework (sector/territory dialogues) to two river cities in order to understand how the interplay between the stakeholders modifies urban geography. Analysing the relationship between the city, the river and the port in Venlo (The Netherlands) and Strasbourg (France) provides examples of project-based urban planning that is founded on negotiation between the river stakeholders (port authorities, inland waterway managers, transport and logistics firms) add the different levels of public policies (municipal, intermunicipal, regional, national levels). Eventually, this approach allows us to consider the forms taken by the above sector-territory dialogue within the urban space in terms of tools and scales. Finally, the paper ends with a discussion about the value of a contribution from geography to an understanding of these governance issues. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kooskora, M				Kooskora, Mari			Corporate governance from the stakeholder perspective, in the context of Estonian business organizations	BALTIC JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Estonia; corporate governance; organizational behaviour; stakeholder analysis; business ethics	PERFORMANCE; OWNERSHIP	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to participate in the discussion of a relatively new field of corporate governance (CG) and its development. The aim of the research is to discover how well-known Estonian business leaders perceive the purpose of business activities, corporate relations with the society and environment and who they consider the most significant stakeholders. These issues are studied and analyzed during a ten-year period in the real-life Estonian business environment. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical part of the paper is based on the results of in-depth interviews with 26 top Estonian managers and owners, often known as generalists. The paper discusses the results of qualitative research conducted among these business leaders, owners and top-managers in Estonian organizations, exploring how business purposes and interests, relations with the society and environment as well as different stakeholders are perceived and how these perceptions have changed in Estonia during the period of ten years (1995-2004). Findings - This paper shows how business purposes, interests, corporate relations with the society and environment as well as with different stakeholders are perceived in a rapidly developing former post-socialist and now EU member state, Estonia. It was revealed that stakeholder interests and corporate relations with the society and environment in business have not yet been considered important issues in business organizations. According to the results, the stakeholder thinking and stakeholder concepts have just recently became recognized and understood among the Estonian business leaders. There is a clear difference seen in two periods studied in this research. Research limitations/implications - The main limitation of the study is related to survey methodology. In-depth interviews are conducted with 26 representatives; this sets limits to the possibility to generalize the results. In further research, the aim is to get more data through structured questionnaires thus enabling to conduct quantitative analysis and draw conclusions based on larger amount of respondents. Practical implications - In order to stay sustainable and be able to develop further there is a need for Estonian business leaders and organizations to start paying more attention to the different stakeholders, and see the organizations as a part of the environment and society. Originality/value - The main contribution of the paper can be found in the in-depth discussion of the concept of CG particularly from the perspective of stakeholder theory.

Designing an inquiry-based learning system: Innovating in research praxis to transform science-policy-practice relations for sustainable development	SYSTEMS RESEARCH AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE			English	Article						learning system design; linear model; SDGs; social learning; sustainability transitions; systemic inquiry; water sensitive cities	WATER; GOVERNANCE; KNOWLEDGE; EXPERIENCES; FRAMEWORK; WORLD	When designers of activities concerned with the dissemination of research findings pursue their practice all too often, the linear model is implicitly or explicitly the default position. This paper uses the lens of praxis (theory-informed practical action) to offer a shift in possibility away from reliance on the linear model of innovation to a second-order modality of research practice more suited to sustainable development goal (SDG) implementation. Whilst second-order modalities of knowledge production, necessary to enact sustainability transitions and transformative praxis, are emerging many lack purposefully designed modes of praxis and are limited in their considerations regarding enactment and performativity. We report on the testing and evaluation of a purpose-driven design of a 'learning system' within the Australian urban-water sector to enact a 'systemic inquiry' capable of generating social learning. Changes in understanding and/or practices by those who participated were achieved, thus satisfying key criteria for initiating but not necessarily sustaining social learning. The praxis innovation described is suited to situations best framed as uncertain, complex and contested. The positive outcomes of the enacted 'learning system' support the case for more investment in action-oriented research to support innovation in the field of second-order systems praxis.

J	Khanal, RC				Khanal, Ram Chandra			Local level natural resource management networks in Nepal: An additional burden or agents of change ensuring environmental governance and sustainable livelihoods?	MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article								Community-Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) has become an important approach to restructuring social relations and governance and to promoting livelihoods and natural resource management practices in many parts of the world. Many people believe CBNRM has, in fact, successfully curtailed state-centered, top-down resource management practices and illegal extraction of resources. However, some people think the approach has supported neo-liberalization and de-concentration processes, and created another layer of elite dominance at the local level. In the context of emerging local institutions, the growing concerns of civil society, and weak national and local governance mechanisms in managing natural resources, it was essential to undertake a study to explore the strengths and weaknesses of community-based groups and networks in the management of natural resources, linking policies and local-level practices.

J	Dillman, KJ; Czepkiewicz, M; Heinonen, J; Davidsdottir, B				Dillman, Kevin Joseph; Czepkiewicz, Michal; Heinonen, Jukka; Davidsdottir, Brynhildur			A safe and just space for urban mobility: a framework for sector-based sustainable consumption corridor development	GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						earth systems (land; water and atmospheric); policies; politics and governance; social value; urban systems	CLIMATE-CHANGE; ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY; TRANSPORT POVERTY; ANTHROPOCENE; IMPACTS; LIFE; FRAGMENTATION; INEQUALITY; TRANSITION; INDICATORS	Non-technical summary The exponential growth of humanity's resource consumption over the last half-century has led to ecological decline while people's basic needs have not been universally satisfied. The 'doughnut economy' and sustainable consumption corridor concepts have gained global attention, providing frameworks in which the maximum allowable environmental impacts and the minimum social levels acceptable to lead a good life establish a guiding pathway to meet human needs whilst remaining within the Earth's carrying capacity. We apply this thinking to the urban mobility sector in this article in an attempt to formulate a 'safe and just space' for urban mobility. Technical summary The theoretical and broad application of the 'doughnut economy' and sustainable consumption corridor concepts are lacking in implementation due to a limited understanding of sectoral thresholds. This study highlights the weakness of sustainable urban mobility indicator studies which often lack connections to ecological ceilings and social foundations and, thus, lack the ability to show if a mobility system is intergenerationally sustainable or not. Therefore, this study aims to bridge this knowledge gap and develop a mobility sector-focused sustainable consumption corridor. It does so by using a collection of concepts and associated indicators ranging from sustainable urban mobility, sustainable consumption corridors, ecological thresholds, needs theory and mobility social impacts to mobility poverty. The output of this study is an initial design of a mobility-focused sustainable consumption corridor with suggested themes and indicators to measure the relative performance of a region in relation to the material dimensions of the corridor accompanied by a discussion surrounding spatial, temporal and sectoral corridor-defining thresholds. This work provides a novel first step in the direction of sector-based sustainable consumption corridors which can aid in providing a transformational alternative to the status quo through the implementation of safe and just sectors. Social media summary This article applies the 'doughnut economy' and sustainable consumption corridors to the urban mobility sector. It provides a framework for evaluating urban mobility systems in terms of their ecological impacts (the 'ecological ceiling') and providing for human needs (the 'social floor'), and for defining a 'safe and just space for urban mobility'.

J	Jonas, AEG; Gibbs, DC				Jonas, AEG; Gibbs, DC			Changing local modes of economic and environmental governance in England: A tale of two areas	SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY			English	Article							URBAN REGIMES; AGENDA; POLICY	Objectives. Using an urban regime theory approach, the article aims to investigate the degree to which environmental policy in England is devolved to the local level of the state and integrates with local economic governance. Methods. Intensive case study research was undertaken in two local areas of the eastern region of England having divergent economic growth trajectories. Methods included analysis of local media and documentation from local and regional organizations, and 30 primary interviews with strategic local actors. Results. The Cambridge Subregion area is experiencing pressures of economic development, creating conflict around the Green Belt and contested meanings of sustainable development. In Waveney-a declining area in search of growth-local groups have struggled to manage local economic regeneration in an environmentally sustainable manner. Both areas have witnessed new territorial-institutional developments in relation to environmental policy making, with limited evidence of policy integration at the subregional scale. Conclusion. Despite the emphasis on local policy integration through sustainable development, the relationship between the economy and the environment in England is a focus of conflict and new territorial-institutional developments. Urban regime theory needs to broaden its focus to include the full variety of interests in local environmental policy and the mechanisms producing new territorial scales of economic and environmental governance.

SDG 17 as Metagovernance Norm and Its Global Health Implementation	POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE			English	Article						accountability; civil society organizations; global health; metagovernance; participation; partnership; sustainable development goals	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; ACCOUNTABILITY; GOVERNANCE; PARTICIPATION	SDG 17 calls for the international community to "strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development," emphasizing the role of multi-stakeholder partnerships for achieving the SDGs. Policy documents are replete with statements on the necessity of 'meaningful' engagement, especially with civil society-without clarifying what 'meaningful' stands for. In this article, we develop an analytical approach to partnership as a form and norm of metagovernance. Partnership as a metanorm is about the roles and relations of different sets of actors. We suggest operationalizing the concept of partnership according to different levels of accountability and participation, allowing for a gradual enhancement of the quality of partnership in terms of 'meaningfulness.' We apply our analytical model to the Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-Being for All (GAP), a fairly new initiative by health and development agencies to accelerate progress towards the health-related targets of the 2030 Agenda. By investigating the development and the early phase of implementing the GAP, we empirically assess if and how the notion of partnership envisioned in the GAP qualifies as 'meaningful' with respect to civil society engagement. From our empirical example, we infer lessons for attaining normative standards of 'meaningfulness' and highlight implications for future research on partnerships.

It is predicted to profoundly influent the society. However, because imperfect management might ruin its operation and future growth, the sharing economy model is rife with conflicts and paradox in terms of logic, boundary, and influence. Taking the Free-floating bicycle sharing (FFBS) as an example, although it is becoming more and more popular in many big cities, the service has led to many problems, including road congestion, parking disorder, and mismanagement of bicycle information. As a result, its sustainable development is severely affected. In this study, we used FFBS as a case study to investigate the relations among government, companies and users. We interviewed varies stakeholders and discussed their different perspectives of collaborative governance. It showed that the parking location, usage frequency, number of parked bicycles, and bicycle health status could be used as indicators to monitor the service situations. We also identified that the wanton occupancy of public space was the major problem of FFBS. To address these issues, we developed a real-time information management platform with information visualization, aimed to help the government, the company, and the users to gather the bicycle information and coordinate their sharing usage. This platform could promote the sustainability of FFBS system and foster the development of other forms of sharing economy in the future.

To avoid further land degradation and promote land restoration, multifunctional use of land is needed within the boundaries of the soil-water system. In addition, awareness-raising, a change in stakeholders' attitudes, and a change in economics are essential. The attainment of a balance between the economy, society, and the biosphere calls for a holistic approach. In this paper, we introduce four concepts that we consider to be conducive to realizing LDN in a more integrated way: systems thinking, connectivity, nature-based solutions, and regenerative economics. We illustrate the application of these concepts through three examples in agricultural settings. Systems thinking lies at the base of the three others, stressing feedback loops but also delayed responses. Their simultaneous use will result in more robust solutions, which are sustainable from an environmental, societal, and economic point of view. Solutions also need to take into account the level of scale (global, national, regional, local), stakeholders' interests and culture, and the availability and boundaries of financial and natural capital. Furthermore, sustainable solutions need to embed short-term management in long-term landscape planning. In conclusion, paradigm shifts are needed. First, it is necessary to move from excessive exploitation in combination with environmental protection, to sustainable use and management of the soil-water system. To accomplish this, new business models in robust economic systems are needed based on environmental systems thinking; an approach that integrates environmental, social, and economic interests. Second, it is necessary to shift from a "system follows function" approach towards a "function follows system" one. Only by making the transition towards integrated solutions based on a socio-economical-ecological systems analysis, using concepts such as nature-based solutions, do we stand a chance to achieve Land Degradation Neutrality by 2030. To make these paradigm shifts, awareness-raising in relation to a different type of governance, economy and landscape and land-use planning and management is needed.

The forest frontier in the Global South: Climate change policies and the promise of development and equity	AMBIO			English	Article						Climate governance; Forest frontier; Inequality; Maladaptation; Politics; REDD plus	REDD PLUS; POLITICAL-ECONOMY; MULTILEVEL GOVERNANCE; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; DEFORESTATION; AGRICULTURE; ADAPTATION; PERCEPTIONS; MITIGATION; DISCOURSE	Halting forest loss and achieving sustainable development in an equitable manner require state, non-state actors, and entire societies in the Global North and South to tackle deeply established patterns of inequality and power relations embedded in forest frontiers. Forest and climate governance in the Global South can provide an avenue for the transformational change needed-yet, does it? We analyse the politics and power in four cases of mitigation, adaptation, and development arenas. We use a political economy lens to explore the transformations taking place when climate policy meets specific forest frontiers in the Global South, where international, national and local institutions, interests, ideas, and information are at play. We argue that lasting and equitable outcomes will require a strong discursive shift within dominant institutions and among policy actors to redress policies that place responsibilities and burdens on local people in the Global South, while benefits from deforestation and maladaptation are taken elsewhere. What is missing is a shared transformational objective and priority to keep forests standing among all those involved from afar in the major forest frontiers in the tropics.

J	Voss, JP				Voss, Jan-Peter			Performative policy studies: realizing "transition management"	INNOVATION-THE EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH			English	Article						performativity; expertise; co-production; innovation; policy instruments; governance; sustainable development	TECHNOLOGICAL TRANSITIONS; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; MULTILEVEL PERSPECTIVE; INNOVATION SYSTEMS; SCIENCE; GOVERNANCE; EVOLUTIONARY; POLITICS; COMPLEXITY	The paper analyses the relations between policy studies and public policy. It traces how they are constitutively entangled. Conceptually, this builds on a notion of performativity that has been developed in science studies. The performativity of policy studies is explored in a case study of the innovation journey of "transition management" as a model for governing sociotechnical change. The paper shows how practices of knowledge production and policy-making take shape in interaction with the model and how a specialized research field coevolves with political alliances and policy programs. They interact in the process of realizing transition management, both by establishing the model as collective knowledge and by materially enacting it. In this interweaving with public policy, policy studies contribute to creating the reality that they describe. The conclusions discuss "realizing" as a mode of governance.

This paper aims to verify the sustainability performance of Brazilian organizations in performance measures and to propose sustainable guidelines with the intention of directing future efforts to the transition to sustainable development. The research utilized a triangulated approach by collecting qualitative and quantitative data acquired through multiple collection methods of a theoretical literature review, documentary analysis of corporate reports, questionnaire survey and semi-structured interviews with industry professionals and academic researchers. The results show that internal organizational factors are the main inductors of the sustainable environment in organizations, and sustainability must be tied to strategic planning, starting from upper management to lower levels. It is essential to use sustainable performance measurement systems in order to respond to external and internal levers and serve as benchmarking for future corporate operations and strategies. In addition, it is the responsibility of organizations to focus their efforts on environmental protection, reduction of energy, corporate reputation, quality management, customer satisfaction and investor relations, as they are considered to be more important and have a relationship of dependence on organizational sustainability. The findings will be of value to professionals and academics who want to start measuring and for continuously improving the sustainability performance of their organizations according to the technical, economic, environmental, social and governance dimensions. This research work also helps to understand the perceptions and expectations of stakeholders.

This stock is now in excellent conditions, producing record catches fully within safe and sustainable biological parameters. The spawning stock biomass of the main groundfish species has increased threefold over the last 15 years. The Barents Sea management is among the most successful management regimes of a major fishery area anywhere, and the focus of this paper is on the governance of the fisheries. The joint Russian-Norwegian governance over the last almost 40 years, through the Joint Fisheries Commission, is a major element in this successful result. The scientific cooperation is described and how it is now integrated into the work of the Commission. The development of long-term strategies for management of joint stocks is described, resulting in agreement on a set of "decision rules" and new regulatory decisions. The period of major problems with overfishing of quotas is described. The level and comprehensiveness of the cooperation is explained with a discussion of the present agreement, for 2015. The issues of zonal borders and the Svalbard Fishery Protection Zone are explained. The paper concludes with comments on the outlook for the future, considering the present situation in relation to developments in Crimea and Ukraine, and the resulting sanctions.

Therefore this study aims at evaluating two banks to find out the factors that hinder sustainable banking in Uganda. The study criticizes a single bottom line vision of banking institutions in which profit maximization is taken as a sole objective in meeting shareholders expectations than overall bank Stakeholders needs in business environment. 30 structured questionnaires were designed and administered on Skype to 30 respondents of the two banks. Respondents were selected from departments of risk management; corporate governance, public relations, corporate social responsibility, 4 directors and 2 officials at Uganda Institute of Bankers were interviewed. Annual bank reports, strategic plans, journals, and conference papers were reviewed. Sustainability programs are among commitments of the two banks depicted in compliance of legislations, financing environmental friendly projects, progression in shareholders wealth, social investments, employee empowerment and embracing diversity participation. Present value at I (PV01), value at risk (VaR) were the techniques to identify market risks in Stanbic Bank. Centenary Bank approach to risk is top down and bottom top thinking to dilute its market risk. 75% of the respondents said credit risk is the most common market problem, 25 % said risks is manageable, efforts should be on innovation of bank products and services. Weak government policies, divergent ideologies, political influence, capital in-adequacy, were identified as hindering factors to sustainable banking in Uganda. The study recommended measures for fostering sustainable banking. However, the study identified guided educational programs as a significant factor that mans ambitions of sustainability not only to the banking sector but, also to the economies at large.

J	de Pedro, JCB				Carlos Barrio de Pedro, Jose			Community involvement in the conservation of natural resources: Interest and limits within a local development perspective for Central Africa (Chad)	CAHIERS AGRICULTURES			French	Article						Central Africa; Chad; community involvement; governance; resource conservation; rural development		Natural resources have an interest for local communities as sources for satisfying their basic needs and of additional activity. However, socio-economic and environmental changes have produced a destabilization of traditional systems, accompanied by a change in power relations between actors and dynamics of often increased resource degradation. Therefore, the concerted management of resources in the framework of development and local governance is becoming increasingly more necessary, under political and legal aspects, to ensure long-term preservation, restoration and integrated management. More widely, citizen participation and successful decentralization, therefore, are necessary conditions for endogenous and sustainable development, conditions that could be catalysed by well-targeted assistance programs. It is essential to understand the interests and limitations of participatory management for the conservation of resources. On the one hand, this type of management presents a conceptual, methodological and operational interest, facilitating institutional emergence and openness to broader development and democratization processes. On the other hand, we must not overlook serious limitations resulting from the disintegration of social organizations, delays of decentralization policies, inadequate intervention strategies, intrinsic deficits of projects, lack of consideration of the temporal and spatial framework, inadequate legal framework, inadequacy of accompanying measures, etc. These limitations can be partially corrected using procedures such as "Project Cycle Management'', procedures which allow prospective management of programs and projects and the highlighting of relevant doubts, useful for improving the likelihood of successful experiences in development.

Authors concerned with global environmental politics have made considerable progress in capturing this phenomenon. Nevertheless, we still lack in-depth empirical knowledge on the precise nature of such institutional interlinkages across governance levels and scales. Building upon the concept oforchestration, this article focuses on the relationship between specific types of international bureaucracies and actors other than the nation-state. In particular, we investigate how the secretariats of the three Rio Conventions reach out to non-state actors in order to exert influence on the outcome of international environmental negotiations. Our analysis demonstrates that the three intergovernmental treaty secretariats utilize various styles of orchestration in their relation to non-state actors and seek to push the global responses to the respective transboundary environmental problems forward. This article points to a recent trend towards a direct collaboration between these secretariats and non-state actors which gives rise to the idea that new alliances between these actors are emerging in global environmental governance.

A growing body of scholarship postulates specific attributes of boundary work that promote used and useful research. These propositions, however, are largely based on the experience of a few industrialized countries. We report here on an effort to evaluate their relevance for efforts to harness science in support of sustainability in the developing world. We carried out a multicountry comparative analysis of natural resource management programs conducted under the auspices of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research. We discovered six distinctive kinds of boundary work contributing to the successes of those programs-a greater variety than has been documented in previous studies. We argue that these different kinds of boundary work can be understood as a dual response to the different uses for which the results of specific research programs are intended, and the different sources of knowledge drawn on by those programs. We show that these distinctive kinds of boundary work require distinctive strategies to organize them effectively. Especially important are arrangements regarding participation of stakeholders, accountability in governance, and the use of "boundary objects." We conclude that improving the ability of research programs to produce useful knowledge for sustainable development will require both greater and differentiated support for multiple forms of boundary work.

Contrary to much conventional (policy) thinking in the European Union (EU) today, our point of departure is not that migration is the problem to be solved - nor that (access to) land is the straightforward means to discouraging migration. Drawing on local case studies in four West African countries, this research aims to shed light on the various relationships between migration and land, and to analyze to what extent they may contribute to or obstruct (local) inclusive and sustainable development in Mali, Senegal, Burkina Faso, and Benin. In doing so, we aim to offer food for thought concerning possible ways for making the connection between migration and land more fruitful and productive for as many people as possible, especially in relation to the opportunities and constraints facing different categories of West African youth.

Sustainable Innovation in Network-Bound Systems: Implications for the Consumption of Water, Waste Water and Electricity Services	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY & PLANNING			English	Article						Network-bound systems; sustainable consumption; social practices; electricity supply; drinking water; waste water management; the Netherlands	URBAN INFRASTRUCTURES; POLICY	Network-bound systems are crucial in environmental governance as the usage of their services embody significant environmental impacts. Conditions for network-bound systems providing services to consumers have altered dramatically over the last decades. Liberalization and privatization have led to a differentiation in providers, technologies, products and services, very a-typical for sectors that were formerly characterized by public and uniform modes of provision and consumption. The paper gives an overview of what the socio-technical differentiation of network-bound systems and services imply for end-users and how new relations emerge between users and providers of water and electricity services. Drawing upon contemporary theory development in science and technology studies and in environmental sociology, the paper presents recent empirical findings of differentiation and innovation in drinking water supply, waste water management and electricity supply in the Netherlands. From these developments, the paper concludes that sustainable innovation in network-bound systems leads to a differentiation of not only resources, providers and technologies but also of consumer roles towards provision and use of water and energy services in various ways. Considering that those diverse services are combined in consumers' social practices, a plea is made for a practice-inclusive perspective on understanding and enhancing sustainable innovation in network-bound systems.

This hypothetical model is supported by case study findings in the North West region of England, feeding in a discussion about some priorities for future research. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A legal pluralism perspective on coastal fisheries governance in two Pacific Island countries	MARINE POLICY			English	Article						Legal pluralism; Customary governance; Community-based marine resource management; Fisheries and environmental legislation; South Pacific	MARINE RESOURCE-MANAGEMENT; SOLOMON-ISLANDS; COMANAGEMENT	In most coastal communities throughout the South Pacific customary rights to regulate access to vital and scarce resources evolved a long time ago. In many places, these systems have formed the basis of community-based marine management efforts. At the same time, national (fisheries and environmental) legislation regulates various aspects regarding the marine realm. The result is a legal pluralist situation a circumstance that can affect the governability of coastal fisheries. This study draws on data from Fiji and Solomon Islands to examine how the national marine governance frameworks and customary/community-based marine resource manage. ment interact. Fiji has a centralized government and customary governance structures are fairly well defined. Various mechanisms exist that link the national and customary systems. In Solomon Islands customary systems and national governance authority are more dispersed and the latter is partly delegated to provincial governments. Here, partner organizations that engage in local marine management can play a vital role in bridging local and (sub-) national levels. The analysis of the two countries reveals that legal pluralist patterns can play out and be addressed differently. A deeper understanding of the interactions between national and customary marine governance systems can help to design procedures or legal mechanisms which optimize relations across levels and systems, and thus contribute to improving governance outcomes.

We draw attention to the differences between this approach and the traditional disease-based approach, showing that the structural approach is centered on health systems, reinforces global governance, and embodies the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), thus taking on a multi-sectoral dimension. This approach leverages the maximum potential of international cooperation by establishing structuring networks and promoting relations between partner countries through their national health institutions, schools of public health, and technical staff. By way of example, we show that this approach is applied in the Union of South American Nations (UNASUL, acronym in Portuguese) and Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP, acronym in Portuguese), especially in Africa. Finally, we underline the importance of this approach for South-South relations, where it addresses the real necessities of partner countries, unlike North-South cooperation that is characterized by power asymmetries, especially within the economic and technical-scientific dimensions.

Kyaw; Neil, Anthony; Win Myo Thu; Doherty, Faith			Democratising timber: An assessment of Myanmar's emerging 'Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade' (FLEGT) process	FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Myanmar; Burma; Timber; Forest; Governance; Policy		Amidst Myanmar (Burma)'s political reform process the forest sector remains an important area awaiting democratisation. Forests historically covered over 50% of the countries' land area, and have been of major importance for both local livelihoods, the national economy and 'ecosystem services' such as biodiversity and catchment hydrology. The export timber trade has however played a decisive role in determining forest sector policy and indeed has exerted a significant influence on overall national politics since the colonial era began and continuing to the present day. Under the post-independence military dictatorship the timber trade involved ever more unsustainable plunder, particularly from the 1970s, rapidly degrading forests. But now reform of Myanmar's timber trade is on the national political agenda, reform which will be crucial for the Nation's transition towards an equitable and sustainable development trajectory. New legislative measures within consuming countries, including the EU, to challenge illegally sourced timber and wood product supplies have begun to exert a catalytic influence on Myanmar's forest policies, and converging with domestic civil society pressures have led in 2013 to the initiation of a formal 'Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade' (or FLEGT) bilateral process between the European Union and the Government of Myanmar. This paper presents an analysis of the nature of Myanmar's current timber trade and of the challenges and opportunities for reform, particularly in relation to the emerging FLEGT process. We argue that there are eight key aspects of Myanmar's timber trade overdue for democratic reform, which the FLEGT process puts into sharp relief: 1) resolution of ethnic conflicts primarily in upland forested areas, 2) reform of forest tenures; 3) a review of overall forest sector policies and the appropriate place of timber production; 4) reform of military era state timber institutions, 5) a return-to silviculturally based sustainable forest management; 6) restructuring of the timber industry away from 'crony' domination; 7) measures to combat illegal logging and assure the rule of law; and 8) citizen participation in policy development and implementation. This 'shopping list' of democratic reforms implies a major and undoubtedly difficult process ahead, and success is far from certain. From 2013 promising initial progress has already begun on several of these areas. However, although the Government of Myanmar may give the international audience the impression that it is rapidly democratising, on the ground only limited substantive changes are yet experienced in rural areas, and resistance to reform persists amongst the military and their commercial partners. A spectrum of possible outcomes for forest sector reform may be foreseen, from mere token improvements on the dictatorship-era 'business as usual' to a thorough realisation of democratic aspirations. The outcome will be determined by the balance of power between civil society, public representatives, timber merchants particularly the powerful so-called 'crony' and proxy military business interests, and the intermediating powers of Government (including a significant rent-seeking 'shadow state'), the EU, and the international markets that drive the demand for Burmese timber. The extent to which the FLEGT process can reinforce the wider democratisation process may be a decisive factor. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Springate-Baginski, Oliver; Thein, Aun. G.

This is against the background of the drive for sustainability in food systems. A diversity of technology applications is unilaterally emerging in all food chains with benefits realized through human acceptance and adoption in business processes. This paper focuses on Australia but the lessons apply to digital agriculture globally. We propose that sustainable food systems frameworks identify the relation of individual changes to broader systemic change, to relate individual changes to one another and to understand how multiple changes within a system can trigger major shifts in entire agri-food chains. With this rapidly-changing landscape in mind, we argue that food system frameworks cover five domains: production, market, capitals, governance and data technologies. We analyse experience from agricultural systems, compare it to digitization in non-agricultural systems and conclude that change will be both disruptive and cumulative. We consider the role of systems governance to be under-reported. Governance will prove critical in areas of IP legislation, policy harmonization and targeted investment.

J	Skagerlind, HH				Hede Skagerlind, Helena			Governing development: global performance indicators and gender policy change in Sub-Saharan Africa	JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Development policy; Gender equality; Global performance indicators (GPI); Millennium development goals (MDG); Process-tracing; Sub-Saharan Africa		Past decades have witnessed an upsurge in the use of global performance indicators (GPIs) to influence state behaviour. Within international development, the millennium development goals (MDGs) introduced an era of indicator-based governance, which now continues with the sustainable development goals (SDGs). The article provides a theoretical and empirical account of the workings and effectiveness of GPI-based development governance. Focusing on MDG 3, which concerned gender equality, the article presents the results of (1) a mapping of GPI adjustment in 15 Sub-Saharan African countries from 2000 to 2015, and (2) a study of the causal mechanisms of gender policy change in Kenya and Ethiopia. The findings demonstrate that MDG 3 was effective in influencing domestic policy commitments but struggled to generate further behavioural change, highlighting the risks of superficial GPI adjustment. The case studies show that domestic change was primarily driven by the donors' economic conditionality and social influence strategies, leveraged through MDG performance assessments. The reason why material and social pressure was unable to close the gap between commitments and implementation efforts rests with its reliance on incentives as a source of change. These findings have implications for GPI-based governance, SDG implementation and gender equality change.

We will see how effective this strategy is for the benefit of companies in terms of reducing costs, leveraging technology while feeding knowledge of indirect or direct customers. Aspects of social capital and sustainable development as the approach of several authors are briefly mentioned. Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to conduct a critical analysis of the importance in the twenty-first century presents a new approach to strategic management based on knowledge from the perspective, of resources and dynamic capabilities, as an explanation of the role critical that these intangible assets presented in today's organizations from the implementation of a particular model of governance of existing knowledge on those, Grant (1996), Spender (1996), Bueno and Salvador (1996), Bueno et all (2006), to overcome the current economic crisis affecting many countries. areas and organizations in the global economy. Design/methodology/approach - We propose an approach work is carried out with a proposal for a study of exploratory character. Social responsibility and commitment to the ecosystem as a social strategy to assist in the socioeconomic development of the organizational environment and as a facilitator for its own sustainable development. Eljkington (1994), Bueno (2011), Leon (2011a), Leon (2011b), Parrish (2010). The exploratory analysis in the tourism sector and in hotel companies that compose it, as evidence of the importance of the new management approach considered, given the nature and character of the business model and its relation to environment performance of this industry and its companies. Bueno (2011). Originality/value - This methodology puts in evidence the methodology carried out will show that this knowledge based on their relationship to socioeconomic sustainabilit, its still emerging approach given its character by emergence time, requires more research efforts and empirical evidence, therefore work shows a value of exploratory character and originality evident within current approaches of strategic management and the knowledge economy, although it emergente. Por results will corroborate the formulated inductive approach, leading rebuttal to some of the guesswork exposed and organizations concerning the tourism sector. Practical implications - The outcomes of the application as indicated, regardless of the overall importance of an analysis of intangible assets and dynamic capabilities that facilitate sustainable economic development in organizations, especially the variables that make up the main concepts the capital of the same, focusing on corporate social responsibility and environmental commitment, stresses that the results are important for designing a management model oriented entity mentioned sustainable development based on existing knowledge in the same in their strategic application in the hotel industry, for example the Tourism sector as previously indicated.

Focusing on the phenomenon of land grabbing, we use a power theoretical framework that differentiates between material and ideational as well as actor-specific and structural sources of power. Our findings suggest that governance by contract, which plays an increasing role in the context of land investments, highly impacts domestic and global power relations and undermines social equity.

Using the theory of inclusive development, the concept of the Right to Development, and their relation to stranded assets, this paper addresses the question: what does inclusive development imply at the national and global level in dealing with oil extraction in the context of climate change? Based on a literature review and a layered case study of Kenya, this paper concludes that (a) Kenyans argue that Kenya has a right to extract and use oil resources and that rich countries should reduce their extraction and use; (b) such a claim could be integrated in an appropriate emissions trading scheme; and that (c) Kenya should also account for the national and local socioecological aspects to reduce potential local conflict, yet the conditions favoring inclusive development are not yet established. However, such an argument may also lead to perverse results. If addressing climate change requires phasing out fossil fuels, this argument may lead to stranded assets in both developed and developing countries, and may ironically leave developing countries poorer off as stranded assets are possibly more expensive than having stranded resources.

By drawing on a large amount of literature, which conceptualises the governance of nature as rooted in power relations, this study opens up our views on the sociotechnical imaginary in the governance of nature. Through a combination of document analysis of Chinese policies and semi-structured interviews, this study argues that the GYRPP mobilised a series of techniques and practices of green governmentality, and finally formed new identities by problematising and visualising the conservation-development nexus. Moreover, China's GYRPP is not a single-dimensional strategy. It attempts to translate and coordinate ecological knowledge through the sociotechnical imaginary of ecological civilisation, and ultimately turn nature into a governable and manageable object. Finally, ecological civilisation becomes a concrete narrative and practice of China's future sociotechnical imaginary to shape China as a leader in sustainable development.

In political CSR literature, these arrangements have been framed as improvements to transnational governance and as being somehow democratic. We draw on Mouffe's works on agonistic pluralism to problematize the notion that consensus-led multi-stakeholder initiatives bring more democratic control on corporate power. We examine two initiatives which address two very different issue areas: the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and the Bangladesh Accord on Fire and Building Safety (The Accord). We map the different kinds of adversarial relations involved in connection with the issues meant to be governed by the two initiatives, and find those adversarial relations to take six main shapes, affecting the initiatives in different ways: (1) competing regulatory initiatives; (2) pressure-response relations within multi-stakeholder initiatives; (3) pressure-response relations between NGOs and states through multi-stakeholder initiatives; (4) collaboration and competition between multi-stakeholder initiatives and states; (5) pressure-response relations between civil society actors and multi-stakeholder initiatives; and (6) counter-hegemonic movements against multi-stakeholder initiatives as hegemonic projects. We conclude that multi-stakeholder initiatives cannot be democratic by themselves, and we argue that business and society researchers should not look at democracy or politics only internally to these initiatives, but rather study how issue areas are regulated through interactions between a variety of actors-both within and without the multi-stakeholder initiatives-who get to have a legitimate voice in this regulation.

Planners, developers, and local authorities in Sogamoso have explicitly framed PUA as a barrier to develop-ment: a backwards, localized, low-tech and economicallypoorly performing activity that needs to make space for a more "productive" "modern" economy. Based on a survey of 160 peri-urban farming and gardening households, this study identifies PUA forms of food self-provisioning and exchange (FSPE) and further characterizes the practice's social embeddedness, barriers, and opportunities as perceived by peri-urban farmers. The article combines scholarship on PUA and 'quiet sustainability' to propose a novel perspective that could help transform the terms of discourse on the role and future of PUA in urban sustainable development from arguments founded in productivity metrics to the appreciation of FSPE as an environmentally sustainable practice that strengthens the social fabric of local communities, thus contributing to their sense of purpose, meaning, and resilience. This study has implications not only for Sogamoso, but also for many other cities in Latin America and the Global South, where the role of PUA in relation to sustainable urban development is being actively contested.

Increasingly, practical limitations in the effectiveness of environmental assessment are attributed to its theoretical shortcomings, particularly in relation to the conception of causation. This research advanced debate oil environmental assessment by examining the theoretical implications of ill empirical analysis of its causal operation in purposefully selected cases. The causal models derived from the research data illustrate the diversity of mechanisms through which environmental assessment can contribute to sustainability and provide an insight into the complexity and contextuality of causation in the empirical assessment can contribute to sustainability and provide an societal expectations concerning environmental assessment's contribution to sustainable development. It is concluded that the interplay or non-ration variables (such as power, agency, experiences and expectations) necessitates the pursuit of a reflexive accommodation of purposes, methods and context in environmental assessment practices.

J	Burandt, A; Molders, T				Burandt, Annemarie; Moelders, Tanja			Nature-gender relations within a social-ecological perspective on European multifunctional agriculture: the case of agrobiodiversity	AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES			English	Article						Multifunctionality; Agrobiodiversity; Societal relations to nature	BIODIVERSITY; SUSTAINABILITY; ECONOMICS; SERVICES	We view agrobiodiversity as a social-ecological phenomenon and, therefore, an example of nature-gender relations within agrarian change, including social, economic, political and technical changes in agriculture and rural areas. As a result of the industrialization of agriculture, nature-gender relations in the field of agrobiodiversity have become characterized by separation processes such as conservation versus use or subsistence versus commodity production. We argue that the sustainable development paradigm, as currently implemented in European Common Agricultural Policy through the concept of multifunctionality, does not necessarily overcome separation tendencies and lead towards integration, despite its claim to bring together different ecological, economic and social needs. In our paper we critically reflect this observation and develop a theory-based analytical framework at the interface of nature and gender relations. For analytical purposes we distinguish between three different agrarian structures (pre-industrialized, industrialized and multifunctional) and focus on the development of two separation tendencies within them and their effects on agrobiodiversity. Concerning nature, we discuss the effects of separating agrobiodiversity conservation and use. With regard to gender, we discuss the separation of subsistence and commodity production. Against this background, we claim for new rural economic rationalities characterized by processes whose qualitative, material and value dimensions maintain agrobiodiversity.

J	Cowell, R				Cowell, R			Substitution and scalar politics: negotiating environmental compensation in Cardiff Bay	GEOFORUM			English	Article						sustainable development; scale; nature conservation; compensation; power; United Kingdom	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; RESTORATION; GEOGRAPHIES; INDICATORS	One of the most contested dimensions of sustainable development is the issue of substitutability-the extent to which environmental qualities can be substituted, either for human-made assets, or for some equivalent environmental function. The main argument of this paper is that dominant economic discourses of sustainability neglect long-standing geographical concerns with scale, embeddedness and abstraction that are inevitably embroiled in the practical negotiation of substitutability. In particular, it seeks to demonstrate how relations of ecological and political scale frame the 'decision space' within which debates about substitution take place. These arguments are developed by analysing conflicts over the development of an amenity barrage across the Taff-Ely estuary in Cardiff, South Wales, and the provision of new wetlands to compensate for the resulting loss of wildlife habitat. This case shows that the scale at which environmental 'assets' are constructed-whether local, national or global-can reveal or obscure distributive effects incurred in maintaining environmental capital through compensatory measures. It also demonstrates how the re-scaling of governance arrangements (in this case to the European Commission) can empower the delivery of environmental management measures but simultaneously re-structures the objects of sustainability, rendering habitats and wildlife populations as disembedded symbols.

Governing for a Healthy Population: Towards an Understanding of How Decision-Making Will Determine Our Global Health in a Changing Climate	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						global health; climate change; adaptive capacity; equity; governance; decision-making	ADAPTIVE GOVERNANCE; VULNERABILITY; RESILIENCE; SCIENCE; POLICY; COMPLEXITY; FRAMEWORK; CAPACITY	Enhancing the adaptive capacity of individuals, communities, institutions and nations is pivotal to protecting and improving human health and well-being in the face of systemic social inequity plus dangerous climate change. However, research on the determinants of adaptive capacity in relation to health, particularly concerning the role of governance, is in its infancy. This paper highlights the intersections between global health, climate change and governance. It presents an overview of these key concerns, their relation to each other, and the potential that a greater understanding of governance may present opportunities to strengthen policy and action responses to the health effects of climate change. Important parallels between addressing health inequities and sustainable development practices in the face of global environmental change are also highlighted. We propose that governance can be investigated through two key lenses within the earth system governance theoretical framework; agency and architecture. These two governance concepts can be evaluated using methods of social network research and policy analysis using case studies and is the subject of further research.

J	Saner, R; Yiu, L; Kingombe, C				Saner, Raymond; Yiu, Lichia; Kingombe, Christian			The 2030 Agenda compared with six related international agreements: valuable resources for SDG implementation	SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE			English	Review						2030 Agenda; SDGs; International Agreements on Sustainable Development; Comparative text analysis; Policy Coherence on Sustainable Development; International Relations of Sustainable Development		A recurrent problem in international organizations is the disappearance of institutional history and knowledge. The same can be said about international agreements unless the same key drafters/negotiators are involved in subsequent agreements which is rarely the case. This study provides an example how institutional memory embedded in international agreements can be preserved for the benefit of the next generation of policy negotiators. Hence, as a contribution to the broader reflection on how to align National Sustainable Development Plans with the implementation plan of 2030 Agenda, the purpose of the study is to present a comparative analysis of the 2030 Agenda with 6 outcome documents that were negotiated and agreed by the UN member countries in the domain of sustainability. This analysis aims to identify issues not covered or "unfinished business" in the 2030 Agenda and addressed in a more comprehensive manner or from different perspectives. The list of agreements and outcome documents included are Agenda 21, Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21, Outcomes of the World Summit on Sustainable Development, the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, The Paris Agreement and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development. Our findings show that these agreements tend to build on each other, not always in the most straightforward manner, but they constitute a complementary set of agreements documenting the existing knowledge and practices on sustainability development. For instance, the 2030 Agenda does not repeal Agenda 21 (1992) or any other of the six agreements analysed, which shows that these preceding international agreements are still relevant for domestication by the signatories. Rather, it is a summative document covering all three pillars of sustainable development (social, environmental and economic). Recommendations are made on what aspects of the previous agreements could be most relevant for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. These points need to be part of the outreach in supporting countries for national implementation of the SDGs. Future research examining the interrelated aspects of international agreements could benefit from applying the same approach of comparative text analysis. This, in turn, will allow for the leveraging of prior consensus and knowledge and add deeper insights to meta-level governance toward a sustainable future. It could also be argued that once the SDGs/2030 Agenda needs to be revisited/revised and be replaced, the approach used for this comparative study could become the model to avoid reinventing the wheel and acknowledge that we are all standing on the shoulders of far-sighted public figures whose innovative thinking should be acknowledged rather than forgotten.

Concerns about 'resource nationalism' and critiques of investor-state dispute settlement have raised questions as to whether the world might be entering a phase of economic dis-integration. To problematize linear accounts of (dis)integration, this article explores the legal arrangements that integrate resource-dependent countries into the global economy. It argues that natural resource extraction is facilitated by a legal regime that sustains dis-integration patterns in global resource governance-including relations between state-based and traditional governance systems; between extractive enclaves and national territories; and between different spheres of international regulation. Some of the recent contestation, then, reflects efforts to (re)integrate dis-integrated legal and social realities, by more fully recognizing local systemsof practiceandbeliefandmoreeffectivelyconsideringhumanrights in investment processes.

J	Mattera, M; Gonzalez, FS; Ruiz-Morales, CA; Gava, L				Mattera, Marina; Soto Gonzalez, Federico; Alba Ruiz-Morales, Carmen; Gava, Luana			Facing a global crisis-how sustainable business models helped firms overcome COVID	CORPORATE GOVERNANCE-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS IN SOCIETY			English	Article						Business model; Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; COVID-19		Purpose The purpose of this study is to analyse how implementation of corporate social responsibility (CSR) policies following United Nations' Global Compact (UNGC) guidelines can contribute to firm's performance during a global crisis, such as the case of COVID-19. Based on the triple bottom line theoretical framework, this work explores the relation between the creation of value and sustainable business models with long-term strategies and strong policy commitments, and their performance in the stock market years later during a crisis. By doing so, new insights on strategic management to create value and consolidate sustainable business models are provided. Design/methodology/approach The present study analyses firms within the context of the European Union, considering the involvement of the region in achieving sustainable development. In particular, the long-term impact in the usage of the UNGC management model and the firm's sustainability performance based on the results during COVID-19 crisis. To achieve this goal, energy firms operating in Spain and subscribing to UNGC were evaluated, specifically those publicly listed in the IBEX35, benchmark index of Spain's Stock Market Interconnection System. In addition, firms were also considered regarding the strong impact within their industries not only nationally but also worldwide. Findings Findings show long-term CSR strategies and a strong commitment to sustainable development contribute to firm's overcoming periods of economic crisis. In addition, considering the environmental impact of the firms' actions, transition to sustainable business and widening portfolio in the case of energy firms proved to have a positive impact in overcoming a hard context such as COVID-19. The virtuous cycle can be created by honouring the social contract, yet the tools and management models shall be further tailored to ensure an effective win-win situation. Originality/value This study evaluates a company's strategic involvement in sustainability, considering the UNGC 10 principles and SDG and the effects of these strategies in the long-term. Specifically, the role of UNGC management model is evaluated in designing effective policies that can help firms better overcome a context of crisis such as COVID-19. Consequently, researchers studying business strategy can incorporate the findings in strategic planning. Practitioners can learn the implications of CSR strategic planning in the long-term. Moreover, work illustrates corporate results in sustainability matters after the first decade of the UNGC management model and the impact of a crisis context.

Using a paradigm of accountable governance and central-local relations in a financial reporting context, textual analysis is deployed to ascertain what financial reporting challenges are faced by the Ministry of Regional Development Authorities (MORDA) in providing an account of the activities of Kenya's RDAs. Over this period, the MORDA received qualified or adverse opinions from the Office of the Auditor General of Kenya because of lack of internal controls and documentation supporting ministry financial statements. The results of the study suggest that the MORDA faces considerable challenges in meeting the expectations of indigenous-based vertical accountability. Suggested alternative indigenous mechanisms for improved reporting are presented by the study in terms of the MORDA-RDAs relationship.

J	Chater, A				Chater, A.			Explaining Russia's Relationship with the Arctic Council	VESTNIK MEZHDUNARODNYKH ORGANIZATSII-INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS RESEARCH JOURNAL			English	Article						global governance; Arctic governance; circumpolar relations; Arctic Council; Russia		Relations between the West and Russia have worsened since Russia annexed Crimea in February 2014. This article explains how this deterioration has affected the Arctic Council. The council is an international institution with eight member states with territory in the Arctic (Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States) as well as six indigenous peoples' organizations. The mandate of the institution is to promote environmental protection and sustainable development in the Arctic. There is currently a debate in the media about the impact of Russia's actions on Arctic governance. Some accounts argue that the Arctic Council's work continues unabated in the aftermath of Crimea, while others point to worrying signs that the institution is experiencing difficulty. This research helps settle this debate by empirically demonstrating Russia's behaviour. It concludes that the breakdown in Russian-United States relations has not had an immediate impact on the council. The article employs descriptive statistics to understand Russia's patterns of activity in the council in three periods (1998-2000, 2007-2009 and 2013-2015). It examines Russia's participation in meetings and its sponsorship of initiatives. It draws from a variety of council documents. It shows that earlier in the history of the council, Russia's participation was similar to the Nordic countries. The article empirically demonstrates that Russia's participation in the Arctic Council has increased over time.(1)	[Chater, A.] Brescia Univ Coll, Sch Humanities, 1285 Western Rd, London, ON N6G 1H2, Canada	Western University (University of Western Ontario)	Chater, A (corresponding author), Brescia Univ Coll, Sch Humanities, 1285 Western Rd, London, ON N6G 1H2, Canada.	achater@uwo.ca		Chater, Andrew/0000-0002-8821-3750					26	6	6	0	7	NATL RESEARCH UNIV HIGHER SCH ECONOMICS	MOSCOW	SHABOLOVKA, 26, MOSCOW, 119049, RUSSIA	1996-7845			VESTN MEZHDUNARODNYK	Vestn.

J	Al-Saidi, M				Al-Saidi, Mohammad			Cooperation or competition? State environmental relations and the SDGs agenda in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region	ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Regional environmental cooperation; Gulf cooperation council (GCC); SDGs; Transboundary environmental governance; Water cooperation		For around 40 years, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries have been developing cooperative frameworks that aim at enhancing security and economic cooperation as well as establishing joint action on common threats such as environmental degradation of the Gulf waters. Population and economic growth, alongside global issues such as climate change, have increased the pressure on vulnerable ecosystems. They have also resulted in the expansion of environmental concerns and the associated risks. In fact, contemporary sustainability issues represented by global visions such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) include numerous issues to tackle sustainability in a comprehensive manner. Using mapping of the SDGbased sustainability issues, this paper examines interstate relations among GCC states aimed at achieving comprehensive sustainability outcomes through regional environmental cooperation. It highlights the conceptual and practical relevance of such regional cooperation among GCC states, which share a common pool resource (the Gulf) and many socio-economic, physical, and cultural similarities. Sustainability issues, interstate relations and GCC-based cooperation are examined in terms of policies, legacies, interests and commitments across different sectors; e.g., water, energy, agriculture, ecosystems, and climate. Despite not being comprehensive and not resulting in strong, enforceable outcomes, regional environmental cooperation in the GCC region has been valuable for environmental collaboration and policy coordination. There is a need to strengthen cooperative frameworks, issue representation, and participation in order to overcome the recent rise in interstate competition and political rifts that are negatively affecting the capacity of the regional level to contribute to future environmental outcomes.

J	Borgese, EM				Borgese, EM			Global civil society: lessons from ocean governance	FUTURES			English	Article								Late 20th century ideas about governance of the world's oceans may provide clues to the role of "civil society" in the 21st century. The UN Convention on Law of the Sea has radically changed traditional ideas about "national sovereignty", shifting its focus from territorial to functional, imposing on states the duty to cooperate and pay taxes, requiring the sharing of sovereign rights, and transcending sovereignty with the "common heritage" concept. The proliferation of nongovernmental organisations operating on the international stage is empowering all elements of a burgeoning global civil society. In some pioneering experiences in international relations, nongovernmental representatives sit on a par with delegates from governments. Most of the elements of global civil society-NGOs, international business, the community of scientists, worldwide media, and local communities-are not yet focused on the kinds of globalization that can narrow the rich-poor gap and promote sustainable development, but in the new century, a more global civil society can play a more constructive role.

Design/methodology/approach - This arena study draws on different sources of evidence, including interviews with nine iaNGOs representatives involved in campaigns in the Niger Delta. The authors mapped out the history of the conflict in order to locate and make sense of the interviewees' views on counter accounting, campaigning strategies, accountability and governance gaps as well as their motivations and aspirations for change. Findings - The evidence revealed an inability of vulnerable communities to engage in relevant governance systems, due to unequal power relationships, corporate actions and ineffective governance practices. NGOs used counter accounts as part of their campaigns to change corporate practices, reform governance systems and address power imbalances. Counter accounts made visible problematic actions to those with power over those causing harm, gave voice to indigenous communities and pressured the Nigerian Government to reform their governance processes. Practical implications - Understanding the intentions, desired outcomes and limitations of NGO's use of counter accounting could influence human rights accountability and governance reforms in political institutions, public sector organisations, NGOs and corporations, especially in developing countries. Social implications - This paper seeks to contribute to accounting research that seeks to protect the wealth and natural endowments of indigenous communities to enhance their life experience. Originality/value - By interviewing the preparers of counter accounts the authors uncover their reasons as to why they find accounting useful in their campaigns.

J	Torvanger, A				Torvanger, Asbjorn			Governance of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS): accounting, rewarding, and the Paris agreement	CLIMATE POLICY			English	Article						Negative emissions; sustainable biomass; carbon capture and storage; emissions accounting; rewarding; Paris agreement	DIOXIDE CAPTURE; CO2 CAPTURE; ENERGY; INVESTMENT; INCENTIVES	Studies show that the 'well below 2 degrees C' target from the Paris Agreement will be hard to meet without large negative emissions from mid-century onwards, which means removing CO2 from the atmosphere and storing the carbon dioxide in biomass, soil, suitable geological formations, deep ocean sediments, or chemically bound to certain minerals. Biomass energy combined with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) is the negative emission technology (NET) given most attention in a number of integrated assessment model studies and in the latest IPCC reports. However, less attention has been given to governance aspects of NETs. This study aims to identify pragmatic ways forward for BECCS, through synthesizing the literature relevant to accounting and rewarding BECCS, and its relation to the Paris Agreement. BECCS is divided into its two elements: biomass and CCS. Calculating net negative emissions requires accounting for sustainability and resource use related to biomass energy production, processing and use, and interactions with the global carbon cycle. Accounting for the CCS element of BECCS foremost relates to the carbon dioxide capture rate and safe underground storage. Rewarding BECCS as a NET depends on the efficiency of biomass production, transport and processing for energy use, global carbon cycle feedbacks, and safe storage of carbon dioxide, which together determine net carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere. Sustainable biomass production is essential, especially with regard to trade-offs with competing land use. Negative emissions have an added value compared to avoided emissions, which should be reflected in the price of negative emission 'credits', but must be discounted due to global carbon cycle feedbacks. BECCS development will depend on linkages to carbon trading mechanisms and biomass trading. Key policy insights A standardized framework for sustainable biomass should be adopted. Countries should agree on a standardized framework for accounting and rewarding BECCS and other negative emission technologies. Early government support is indispensable to enable BECCS development, scale-up and business engagement. BECCS projects should be designed to maximize learning across various applications and across other NETs. BECCS development should be aligned with modalities of the Paris Agreement and market mechanisms.

Although competitiveness can be assessed according to a range of criteria, there is a common notion that the ability to respond to consumers' requirements leads to the differentiations of destinations on the global market. There is no doubt that consumers look for destinations that take a lead on responsibility - better environmental and social records. Thus, tourism faces self- destruction if it fails to preserve the natural resources and socio-cultural authenticity on which it relies. Tourism needs to be marketed responsively and needs to strive for effective destination management through promoting the participation of private and public sector organizations in the development of tourism strategies. If a destination wants to record improvements in relations to sustainability and competitiveness and find appropriate ways to contribute to overall sustainability, it needs to monitor development. With respect to multidimensional sustainable boundaries, there is a need to develop multiple indicators to measure each dimension of sustainability. The purpose of this paper is to determine to what extent the coastal destination Medulin, Croatia gears to develop sustainable tourism in accordance with the methodology of European Tourism Indicator System for Sustainable Destinations (ETIS-SD). The aim is to concentrate on presenting the results in a way that make them useful to those interested in sustainable tourism development.

As such, we try to find out whether there is an association between financial performance and stakeholder relations with respect to different theoretical notions about the firm. Financial performance is operationalized as the financial return of a firm's shares. For stakeholder relations, we look into community involvement, corporate governance, employee relations, environmental conduct, diversity of the workforce, human rights policies and product attributes. We find that the different components of stakeholder relations appear to be associated in a complex manner with shareholder performance. Therefore, it adds value to look closely into the details of stakeholder relations in connection with financial performance. Copyright (C)3 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

Greenlandic Mining Politics in an Era of Transition	WILL TO DRILL - MINING IN ARCTIC COMMUNITES	Springer Polar Sciences		English	Article; Book Chapter						Arctic mining; Multi-level governance; Local government; Development strategies; Land use challenges	STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT	Greenland is challenged by harsh economic realities. The exploitation of mineral and energy resources seems to be among the most obvious ways to address the challenges of ensuring a viable and sustainable future for Greenland and its communities. The economic issues are particularly important in relation to the ambitions of taking over responsibilities regarding other policy areas like foreign affairs, and monitoring and protection of fisheries rights where the Danish government is still in charge and paying the costs. Resource management in Greenland has been characterized by pragmatic approaches, not only to the managing of the living and renewable resources, but also in connection with the ongoing adjusting the regulations for mining. The block grant from Denmark acts as a stabilizer for Greenland's economy, reducing overheating in times of large natural-resource revenue as it is reduced when income from extractive industries are of a significant size. This reduces the potential for "boom and bust" scenarios occurring, as observed in other parts of the Arctic. Nevertheless, irrespective of whether one sees the Greenlandic discourse on mining as hegemonic or not in terms of future development, mining activities may have a potentially far reaching impact on various ecosystem services - and hence on these services' role as developmental alternatives or supplements to mining.

Strategic Innovation as a Factor of Adaptation of National Economies to the Development of Global Value Chains	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						sustainable development; strategic innovation; adaptation factors; national economy; global value chains; transformation processes; sustainable development	CARBON TECHNOLOGICAL-INNOVATION; SUPPLY CHAIN; PRODUCTION NETWORKS; INDUSTRY; SYSTEMS; SUSTAINABILITY; MANAGEMENT; IMPACT; POLICY; OPPORTUNITIES	In age of sustainable development, strategic innovations have become the most important factor in the adaptation of national economies to dynamic global changes, encompassing trade and economic relations between the leading and developing countries of the World. At the same time, the task of this study was to reveal the complex and contradictory role of strategic innovations in the development of national economies against the background of the transformation of global value chains (GVCs). Main methods for solving the problem were empirical methods of comparative and structural analysis, as well as econometrics. The study analyzed 44 countries classified by the World Bank in the group of countries with per capita incomes below and above the average, as well as with high income. Results of the calculations made it possible to establish a highly differentiated relationship between the share of products manufactured by foreign companies operating in the host countries, on the one hand, and indicators of the dynamics of foreign direct investment (the number of researchers engaged in R&D, the number of technical specialists involved in research and development (R&D), the cost of research and development in the territory of the host countries), on the other hand. This made it possible to determine the role of strategic innovation in the adaptation of national economies. The established dependencies expand the understanding of the role of strategic innovations in the formation and further development of global value chains and their significance in evolution: from process and product innovations of individual companies to the formation of global innovation ecosystems.

We base our contribution on an empirical study related to policy and project interventions implemented by governmental agencies and international development partners in Laos. The studied interventions are the so-called 'village livelihood development grants' that involve giving individual households cash payments to limit shifting cultivation practice and to engage in 'alternative and more sustainable' livelihood activities, promoted by a number of state policies and donor funded projects. Promoted alternative livelihoods include cash crop production, cattle rearing and income generating activities, such as weaving. Based on our empirical case, we explore the implications of these interventions on local peoples' livelihoods, food security and access and rights to resources, on the one hand, and offer theoretical implications to resilience scholarship, on the other hand. We identify analytical elements with respect to social and power relations and show their relevance for local community members' ability to deal with the imposed external forces to change, and hence community resilience. We find that horizontal and vertical power relations, exercised through direct/visible and indirect/hidden ways, significantly influence the socio-ecological outcomes of the interventions, and abilities of individual members of the community to benefit, or bear costs and risks from the interventions.

This paper focuses on efforts to build local institutional capacity in two British regions - Wales and North East England - with a similar industrial past but dissimilar institutional structures. Addressing recent debates on the 'new regionalism' in economic geography, particularly in terms of the perceived neglect of exogenous forces and the failure to assess the scope for regional agencies to actually foster 'embeddedness', the paper examines the activities of sub-national state agencies in relation to recent efforts to attract and 'embed' mobile investment. We explore the process of local capacity-building according to four key themes identified from a review of recent work on regional governance and economic development. These refer to the role of the central state in structuring economic governance; the organisation of interinstitutional relations; questions of regional coherence and identity in the face of pressures of inter-regional competition and sub-regional fragmentation; and the place of inward investment within broader strategic choices regarding economic development. In conclusion, we suggest that regional agencies capacity to foster embeddedness is limited in the absence of stronger forms of regulation over FDI flows at national and international levels.

Perceived and real differences notwithstanding, both place infrastructures at the heart of global development. The present article analyses the relations between this new developmental thinking and law. The fluid rearrangement of public and private, formal and informal legal frameworks spurred by BRI indicate the emergence of a transnational legal infrastructure both tied to and facilitated by a material pragmatism at odds with China's rhetorical embracement of international law as we know it. The implementation infrastructure of SDGs, for its part, reveals a resilience-driven style of governance difficult to reconcile with the futurity attaching to the idea of law. While these findings would suggest a retreat from international law, the present article argues that many types of global law are emerging and resurfacing from infrastructural developmentalism.

BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						disaster; disclosure; public accountability; resource governance; sustainable development; waste	MINE TAILINGS; INFORMATION DISCLOSURE; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS; CONSEQUENCES; DISASTER; RISK; ACCOUNTABILITY; GOVERNANCE; MANAGEMENT; BUSINESS	In this article, we critically analyse emerging regulatory controls around the design and management of tailings facilities in the global mining industry. Following several high profile, catastrophic tailings facility failures, a Global Tailings Review (GTR) was established to develop a new industry Standard. We describe the precursors to the GTR and review the public disclosure requirements of 19 separate industry-endorsed standards and certification schemes. On several criteria, the GTR Standard requires unprecedented levels of public disclosure by mining companies. Does this amount to a 'transparency turn' in tailings management? We argue that while improved disclosure provisions may provide visibility for investors, regulators and other stakeholders, the socialisation of transparency norms is a highly complex, contingent and ultimately fragile endeavour. Using indicators relevant to achieving transparency, we demonstrate the contextual variability into which mining companies will be disclosing information. Our analysis highlights the sheer number of tailings facilities in locations with multi-dimensional complexity, including low levels of literacy and governance, with correspondingly high levels of inequality and corruption. We discuss these conditionalities in relation to the GTR Standard, and conclude by outlining future research priorities.

In this context, organizations have possibilities to develop sustainability strategies from their resources and initiatives focused on their organizational boundaries. However, when these strategies are extended to supply chains more effective results can be achieved by using internal resources and capabilities for developing to interorganizational relationships. Therefore, this study aims to understand how resources and capabilities can facilitate the application of sustainable supply chain management from the perspective of the Resource Based View (RBV) and Relational View (RV). Thus, a theoretical essay was developed in order to present how those perspectives can be used as a base to propose some practical directions for companies to use resources and capabilities to develop sustainable strategies along the supply chain. Therefore, we present that the perspectives of RBV and RV integrated to the context of sustainable supply chain management can bean opportunity to explore how to integrate internal organizational elements into collaborative relationships in supply chains through appropriate governance mechanisms. Also, presents potential organizational actions that can lead to the creation of competitive and / or collaborative advantages. In this context, this paper contributes to the literature improvement to address the development of resources and capabilities in relation to sustainable supply chain management.

Governing sustainability: a dialogue between Local Agenda 21 and transition management	LOCAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Local Agenda 21; transition management; governance for sustainability; local governance; sustainability transition	GOVERNANCE; INSIGHTS; POLITICS; SYSTEMS; CLIMATE; POLICY; CITY	Since the 1990s, the local level of governance has become increasingly important in addressing the challenge of sustainable development. In this article, we compare two approaches that seek to address sustainability locally, namely Local Agenda 21 and transition management. Discussing both approaches along six dimensions (history, aim, kind of change, governance understanding, process methodologies, and actors), we formulate general insights into the governance of sustainability in cities, towns, and neighbourhoods. This dialogue illustrates two related modes of thinking about sustainability governance. We touch upon the importance of an integrated perspective on sustainability transitions through which sustainability is made meaningful locally in collaborative processes. We suggest that the explicit orientation towards radical change is a precondition for governing sustainability in a way that addresses the root causes of societal challenges. Governing sustainability should address the tensions between aiming for radical change and working with status quo-oriented actors and governing settings. We conclude that governing sustainability should be about finding creative ways for opening spaces for participation, change, and experimentation, that is, for creating alternative ideas, practices, and social relations.

However, sustainable exploitation, fair access and equitable benefits from marine genetic resources, such as seaweeds have yet to be fully realised. Patchy fundamental knowledge on the genetic diversity and metabolic potential of algae limits their exploitation; scant practical skills and low investment in breeding restricts germplasm availability and the Nagoya protocol has only partially remediated insufficient governance. Further developments and the addressing of knowledge gaps in relation to biosecurity, breeders' rights and conservation of genetic resources are needed for progress. We review how seaweed genetic resources are currently used in aquaculture, in relation to the diversification and rapidly increasing use of marine resources. Using a revealing case-study, we summarise the potential for positive societal change, underpinned by the cultivation of eucheumatoid carrageenophytes (species of the red algal genera Eucheuma and Kappaphycus), an activity which has been successfully initiated in many tropical countries to support their economic development. We also review the challenges currently faced by this industry and identify potential threats to the seaweed cultivation sector. Accordingly, we suggest new directions to support the continued development of an economically resilient and environmentally sustainable industry based on the utilisation of genetic resources.

In this article, we provide a comprehensive analysis of this concept by focusing on its origin, evolution and philosophical foundation. We show that the concept originated during the presidency of Hu Jintao, who initially used it for the domestic affairs of China. However, the usage of the concept was later extended from domestic to international affairs. Though Hu Jintao conceived the CSFM concept, it is president Xi Jinping who became its greatest advocate. We explore the CSFM concept's development and evolution into one of the most influential, diverse and dominant concepts of international relations under president Xi. We argue that although CSFM concept is seen as a 21st century Chinese idea, the roots of the concept can be traced back to much earlier time in history. The concept is based on three major philosophical thoughts: Marxism, Confucianism and the philosophy of Mencius. We show that the CSFM concept is greatly influenced by Marx's ideas such as the transformation of the world, the free association of producers, historical materialism and dialectics. We also point to a number of Confucian principles that are adopted by the CSFM concept. The CSFM concept not only adopts Confucian principles but also extends their scope from the individual level to international relations. Similarly, we also highlight that the CSFM concept is influenced by Mencius' concepts such as universal brotherhood, responsibility towards the betterment of the world, humane governance, free trade, equal sharing of wealth and the conservation of natural resources.

Such cross-scale social relations can be analysed through a telecoupling framework as decisions taken at local scales are often shaped by actors at larger scales. Analyzing these cross-scale relations is critical to create effective and equitable strategies to manage ecosystem services. Here, we develop an analytical framework -i.e. the 'cross-scale influence-dependence framework'- to facilitate the analysis of power asymmetries and the distribution of ecosystem services among the beneficiaries. We illustrate the suitability of this framework through its retrospective application across four case studies, in which we characterize the level of dependence of multiple actors on a particular set of ecosystem services, and their influence on decision-making regarding these services across three spatial scales. The 'cross-scale influence-dependence framework' can improve our understanding of distributional and procedural equity and thus support the development of policies for sustainable management of ecosystem services.

At the same time, regions are often criticized for lacking effective implementation, especially in relation to gender equality. PurposeThis study examines whether the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) implements its global commitment to gender equality at a regional level. Methods and approachWe apply qualitative analysis of key ASEAN documents in order to determine how gender equality is implemented regionally. We particularly focus on frameworks related to female migrant workers in ASEAN. FindingsThe analysis shows that ASEAN is formally committed to improving gender equality at a regional level, however, female migrants often end up in unfavourable conditions and precarious work relationships without any institutionalized protection because ASEAN's gender equality initiatives are largely concentrated in the Cultural Community and absent from the Economic Community, indicating an absence of normative coherence for development with regard to gender equality. Policy implicationsThis limited impact of emerging regional commitments to gender equality arises from incoherences in ASEAN's normative governance framework which undermine normative coherence for development at the regional level.

Goal 9 of the SDGs is to 'build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation'. Much has been written on the connection between intellectual property and development. With respect to developing countries, arguments have been canvassed both for and against intellectual property in the pursuit of their development goals. The adoption of the TRIPS Agreement in 1994 heralded a new era of global intellectual property governance aimed at a substantial harmonisation of intellectual property protection standards across the globe. This continues to raise continuing concerns in relation to the extent to which IP could foster development and industrialisation in developing countries and whether the global IP regime is designed in a way that sufficiently protects the interest of the developing and least developed nations. The development rhetoric is assuming an increasing significance in Africa given the continent's varying development challenges. This calls for some reflection on the interface between IP protection and the pursuit of sustainable human and economic development. The paper examines the link between intellectual property and health and how it relates to sustainable development in the African context.

The search for new energy and new materials jeopardizes the margin to promote sustainable development in many local communities. In this paper, we examine a conflict related to hydrocarbons projects in the Balearic Sea (Spain) from the social innovation perspective. This novel approach allows us to focus on how socially innovative responses can be triggered by environmental threats. A set of mixed methods (qualitative analysis and social network analysis) are implemented to study the emergence and development of Alianza Mar Blava in Ibiza-Formentera. This is an initiative that successfully activates new social relations and new collective practices that contribute to transform the environmental conflict. In this study, we highlight the strategic factors that allow the conflict to be transformed as well as other social processes that ultimately promote local sustainable development beyond the conflict.

This paper shares insights from an interdisciplinary research project that has proposed the concept of 'sustainable flood memory' in the context of effective flood risk management. The research aimed to increase understanding of whether and how flood memories from the UK Summer 2007 extreme floods provide a platform for developing lay knowledges and flood resilience. The project investigated what factors link flood memory and lay knowledges of flooding, and how these connect and disconnect during and after flood events. In particular, and relation to flood governance directions, we sought to explore how such memories might play a part in individual and community resilience. The research presented here explores some key themes drawn from semi-structured interviews with floodplain residents with recent flood experiences in contrasting demographic and physical settings in the lower River Severn catchment. These include changing practices in making flood memories and materialising flood knowledge and the roles of active remembering and active forgetting.

From different approaches, works have documented how as infrastructure extracts, contains, channels, processes, leaks, or distributes waters it produces new kinds of spaces and reproduces inequalities or differences between them. Scholars studying water infrastructure have also participated in debates on nonhuman agency, materiality, and malfunction.

The governance of transition toward renewable energies can be divided conceptually into two phases, namely systemic analysis and policy making. This paper focuses on identifying different methodological steps in the systemic analysis phase. These steps provide requisite inputs for the second phase, policy making, by attaining a concrete understanding of the current status. In the first step, the boundaries of the transition process are defined by specifying the unit of analysis and identifying the system's components and relations. In the second step, and in order to have a big picture of the system's transformation, the dynamism of technological development is mapped through time. In the third step, an approach for analyzing and policy making of sustainability transition is chosen by comparing various approaches and selecting the most fitted one. All of these methodological steps are finally applied in the case of the Iran fuel cell technology development program to show the practicality of the proposed conceptual framework in a real case problem and to provide some insights for practitioners.

J	Mann, C				Mann, Carsten			Strategies for sustainable policy design: Constructive assessment of biodiversity offsets and banking	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES			English	Article						Biodiversity offsets; Policy assessment; Social dynamics; Critical issues; Innovation agenda	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; CONSERVATION BANKING; INSTRUMENTS; VALUATION; STATE; MITIGATION; GOVERNANCE; SECTION; MARKET	To successfully shape future policies and new forms of governance for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services, careful assessment is needed at an early stage of policy development. This paper describes the concepts and first application for a constructive assessment of biodiversity offsets and banking schemes: the Challenging Futures approach. The approach builds on insights in the area of technology assessment which seek to open innovation processes to related societal concerns to bring about sustainable improvement. As its main objective, Challenging Futures endeavors to create a more inclusive discourse about biodiversity offsets and banking, that is, to make issues of their design, functions, and implications more debatable, especially for new actors such as outsiders and critics. Based on a set of future scenarios for biodiversity offsets and banking, workshop participants identified, debated, and described critical issues and challenges, some of which have been backgrounded in the course of policy developments. One basic finding from the workshop is that although the design of biodiversity offset approaches and valuation methods is predominantly framed in functional and methodological terms, it is almost always linked to more fundamental philosophies, worldviews, and different rationalities concerning how to see, use, and value nature. The design and implementation of biodiversity offset and banking schemes are thus as much a political as a technical issue, a matter of concern and judgment, fact and functionality. It therefore requires an open, anticipatory, reflexive, and contested debate to make sound, that is a broader acceptance of decisions about the design and use of new biodiversity conservation approaches before certain designs are implemented over a range of different socio-ecological and cultural contexts. This paper summarizes the issues and challenges discussed by workshop participants in relation to the future development of biodiversity offsetting. These assessment results feed back into the design and development of policy approaches. More robust and socially embedded, and hence sustainable, policy solutions are the desired result. In the course of the paper, the political and societal implications for the future development of biodiversity offset and banking approaches are discussed and the chances and limitations for using the Challenging Futures assessment approach highlighted.

Responding to this call, we synergized a holistic philosophical framework (comprising ecological systems theory, symbolic interactionism, and intersectionality) and social constructionist grounded theory and ethnography within a critical Indigenous research paradigm as a methodology for exploring how diverse individual and contextual factors influence DRR in a remote Indigenous community called Galiwinku, in the Northern Territory of Australia. Working together, Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers collected stories in local languages using conversations and yarning circles with 20 community members, as well as participant observations. The stories were interpreted and analysed using social constructivist grounded theory analysis techniques. The findings were dialogued with over 50 community members. The findings deeply resonated with the community members, validating the trustworthiness and relevance of the findings. The grounded theory that emerged identified two themes. First, local Indigenous knowledge and practices strengthen Indigenous people and reduce the risks posed by natural hazards. More specifically, deep reciprocal relationships with country and ecological knowledge, strong kinship relations, Elder's wisdom and authority, women and men sharing power, and faith in a supreme power/God and Indigenous-led community organizations enable DRR. Second, colonizing practices weaken Indigenous people and increase the risks from natural hazards. Therefore, colonization, the imposition of Western culture, the government application of top-down approaches, infiltration in Indigenous governance systems, the use of fly-in/fly-out workers, scarcity of employment, restrictions on technical and higher education opportunities, and overcrowded housing that is culturally and climatically unsuitable undermine the DRR capability. Based on the findings, we propose a Community-Based DRR theory which proposes that facilitating sustainable Indigenous DRR in Australian Indigenous communities requires Indigenous and non-Indigenous partners to genuinely work together in two-directional and complementary ways.

They can not only provide opportunities for devolved decision-making and policy experimentation but can also act to reduce standards and inhibit coordinated action. Ecologically sustainable development presents a particular challenge because it relies on the engagement of all levels of government at both the planning and implementation stages. This paper argues that limited state engagement at the conceptualisation phases and the absence of central leadership in the intergovernmental arena in the implementation phase may help explain the failure of this bold meta-policy in changing the game at a national level.

The Convention on Wetlands of International Importance (Ramsar Convention) embodies this collaborative paradigm by suggesting that people and local governments can be collective stewards for the "wise use'' of wetlands on which they depend for water resources and livelihoods. Although collaborative approaches are increasingly recommended to govern large and complex mountain waterscapes across multiple jurisdictions, recent international case study comparisons highlight the site-specific nature of institutional design and the effect that changing social relations and overlapping or conflicting rights and boundaries have on promised collaborative outcomes. This article illustrates the usefulness of a recently developed community-based natural resource management comparative framework for assessing the feasibility of collaboratively governing a proposed Ramsar wetland in the Southern Andes of Ecuador across multiple communities and jurisdictional boundaries. By using data from a rapid ethnographic assessment, US and Ecuadorian students and faculty found local and institutional support for wetland protection. The framework's preconditions were useful in identifying conflicts among and within communities, and among agency rules and resources; these conflicts could limit the feasibility of community-based and collaborative management unless coordination authority is clarified, especially at the proposed transboundary scale. This study showed that increasing attention to land tenure conflicts and institutional frameworks is needed for any collaborative governance design to be sustainable, which confirms political ecology findings.

J	Kopfmuller, J; Lehn, H; Nuissl, H; Krellenberg, K; Heinrichs, D				Kopfmueller, Juergen; Lehn, Helmut; Nuissl, Henning; Krellenberg, Kerstin; Heinrichs, Dirk			Sustainable Development of Megacities: An Integrative Research Approach for the Case of Santiago Metropolitan Region	ERDE			English	Article							URBAN SUSTAINABILITY; LATIN-AMERICA; INDICATORS	Megacities present both opportunities and challenges for sustainable development. This ambiguous role has prompted a scientific attention in recent years in three directions and lines of interest. A first line takes a phenomenological perspective on the 'dramatic' reality, i.e., the tremendous problems and sustainability deficits that megacities and their population face. A second interest focuses on the emerging and changing functions of large urban agglomerations and their role in national and global economic, political and social networks. A third interest seeks to understand megacities from the point of systems dynamics and their relation with sustainability, risk and urban governance as related fields. This article is written to encourage further debate particularly in relation to the third line of interest. It departs from the proposition that the extreme size, change dynamics and complexity of megacities require novel research efforts for providing orientation and implementation knowledge for current and future sustainability. It presents an integrative research approach of the Risk Habitat Megacity (RHM) research initiative applied to the Metropolitan Region of Santiago de Chile. This approach firstly analyses current levels of sustainability on the basis of a complementary indicator set for the case of the metropolitan region in general and, more specifically, for the current sustainability performance in a quite comprehensive range of fields or sectors, including transportation, land use, energy, water resources and services, waste, air quality, and processes of socialspatial differentiation. The integrative sustainability concept of the Helmholtz Association that guides this analysis consists of a set of rules that describe minimum conditions for sustainable development that ought to be guaranteed for all human beings living in present and future generations. This framework permits the application to different contexts and serves as a tool to make explicit current sustainability performance and to develop normative targets on desirable sustainability levels. Based on the historic trends and the current sustainability situation, the approach secondly performs a scenario analysis of 'likely' development paths and futures for a set of scenario alternatives. The explorative scenario framework contains the identification of a set of forces that drive the development of the entire metropolitan region and, again, their influence on likely alternative trends in particular aspects of the fields and sectors included in the analysis. Beside illustrating the analytical approach and its methodology, the article also highlights initial results of the ongoing work. With respect to current sustainability performance in the case study region, the analysis at the general level of the metropolitan region reveals for example contrasting trends with positive sustainability performance on indicators relating mainly to economic and ( to some extent) social development ( e. g. poverty, child mortality) and rather negative trends with respect to environmental quality ( e. g. energy use, CO 2 emissions). The discussion likewise takes a closer look at the specific sustainability performance of two of the included fields or sectors: water resources and services, and processes of socio-spatial differentiation. Building on the current situation, the paper moves on to illustrate some results of the scenario analyses. Using the example of social-spatial differentiation processes, it examines the future trends in housing construction and its relationship wth segregation patterns for each of the scenario alternatives. Regarding the water sector, it sheds light on the access to drinking water and sanitation as well as on the storm water discharge situation, and it reflects the future water resource availability considering existing knowledge about regional climate change impacts. A final section discusses some of the insights and lessons learnt from the application of the approach which hopefully prove inspiring for similarly comprehensive research efforts that focus on megacities.

This project, institutionalized in the 2011 Constitution, defines the territorial organization of the Kingdom and reinforces decentralization according to a model of advanced regionalization. Through advanced regionalization, Morocco aims at integrated and sustainable development in economic, social, cultural and environmental terms, through the development of the potential and resources of each region. However, in order to honor this commitment of advanced regionalization, local authorities must be assisted in adopting a local strategic planning approach, allowing them to develop territorial plans for sustainable development in accordance with the national legal framework, specifically the Framework law 99-12, and international commitments in terms of environmental protection. This research deals with the issue of environmental governance in relation to the role and duties of local authorities. Thus, the main goal of our study is to present the guidelines to be followed by the local authorities to improve the quality of the environment integration process in the local strategic planning with the aim of putting it in a perspective of sustainable development.

The perspective is guided by the thematic interests of the special issue, with the goal of enriching understanding of both the OECD's changing positions and capacities in the global field, and the theories, ideas and styles of reasoning it has employed (as well as how they operate). The paper takes its starting point from recent scholarship in international relations (IR) that has applied narrative to the study of international organisations, highlighting the central role of strategic narratives in forging world order and in establishing organisational legitimacy. We describe the core narrative as akin to a Three Act Play (with five stages) which we use as a heuristic device to trace the entwined development stories of PISA and the advent of Humanitarian Assessment in international development.

J	Walker, RM; Hills, P				Walker, Richard M.; Hills, Peter			Partnership Characteristics, Network Behavior, and Publicness: Evidence on the Performance of Sustainable Development Projects	INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article							HONG-KONG; MANAGEMENT; GOVERNANCE; BUSINESS; SECTOR	This study examines partnership characteristics, network behavior, and publicness in the complex policy arena of sustainable development (SD). The study is set in Hong Kong, a city moving away from command-and-control policy instruments to the use of partnerships and stakeholder engagement. It is contended that network partnership characteristics of commitment, equity, mutuality, and trust together with network behavior will vary by the degree of publicness but collectively contribute in a positive manner towards the performance of SD projects. Data were collected from members of 28 SD advisory committees/representative organizations (a 57% response rate) and resulted in a usable dataset of 53 SD projects. Results of analysis indicate that government, business, and civil society SD project members do not perceive major differences between partnership characteristics and perceived project performance but do in relation to network behavior. Multiple regression analysis suggests that trust contributes towards perceived project performance, as do the network behavior characteristics of private sector and civil society group actors; however, for the latter group, network behavior is negatively correlated with project performance. The conclusion discusses implications of these findings for the study of SD projects in Hong Kong and beyond.

Motivation: This article uses three case studies to illustrate how specific policy interventions can address the differentiated priorities of men and women with relation to food security, building sustainable peace processes and achieving gender equality. Purpose: The article illustrates how five pathways have operated and interacted in three selected FAO interventions, and discusses data, research and policy challenges that emerged from this analysis. Approach and methods: A conceptual framework grounded on five pathways is used, including changes in (a) behaviour, agency and aspirations; (b) social norms about gender roles and equality; (c) institutions and governance; (d) agriculture and employment markets; and (e) social cohesion and inclusive collective action. Findings: The institutions that emerge from complex processes of interaction between state and non-state armed actors, other informal actors and different population groups shape how property rights, food distribution systems, employment programmes and social service provision support or fail to support the local populations. Policy implications: More information is needed on local conflict dynamics. As such, better data collection is needed to support policy interventions.

As a result, vast troves of contextual and actionable data are being produced and used to operate, regulate, manage, and organize urban life. This data-driven approach to urbanism has recently become the mode of production for smart sustainable cities, which are accordingly becoming knowable, tractable, and controllable in new dynamic ways, responsive to the data generated about them by reacting to the analytical outcome of many domains of urban life in terms of enhancing and optimizing operational functioning, planning, design, development, and governance in line with the goals of sustainable development. However, topical studies tend to deal mostly with data-driven smart urbanism while barely exploring how this approach can improve and advance sustainable urbanism under what is labeled 'data-driven smart sustainable cities' as a leading paradigm of urbanism. Having a threefold aim, this chapter first examines how data-driven smart sustainable cities are being instrumented, datafied, and computerized so as to improve, advance, and maintain their contribution to the goals of sustainable development through enhanced practices. Secondly, it highlights and substantiates the real potential of big data technology for enabling such contribution by identifying, synthesizing, distilling, and enumerating the key practical and analytical applications of this advanced technology in relation to multiple urban systems and domains with respect to operations, functions, services, designs, strategies, and policies. Thirdly, it proposes, illustrates, and describes a novel architecture and typology of data-driven smart sustainable cities. This chapter intervenes in the existing scholarly conversation by calling attention to a relevant object of study that previous scholarship has neglected and whose significance for the field of urbanism is well elucidated, as well as by bringing new insights to and informing the ongoing debate on smart sustainable urbanism in light of big data science and analytics. This work serves to bring data-analytic thinking and practice to smart sustainable urbanism, and seeks to promote and mainstream its adoption, in addition to drawing special attention to the crucial role and enormous benefits of big data technology and its novel applications as to transforming the future form of such urbanism.

POLITICAL QUARTERLY			English	Article						Devolution; democracy; local governance; England; civic engagement		The Cities and Local Government Devolution Bill 2015-2016[HL] was introduced into the House of Lords as Bill No. 1 in the 2015-2016 parliamentary session. The Bill forms a critical element of the government's high-profile policy of devolving powers and responsibilities to local areas within England. The transition from first-generation city deals' to second-generation devolution deals' within five years provides a sense of the pace and development of the reform agenda but there is also a strong sense that something is missing. Missing' in the sense of an understanding of the specific type of devolution on offer, missing' in the sense of how an explosion of bilateral new deals' will be offset against the obvious risks of fragmentation and complexity, and missing'most importantlyin relation to the democratic roots that might be put in place to counterbalance the economic thrust and make the reform agenda sustainable. It is in exactly this context that this article argues that the full potential of the current devolution agenda will only be realised when the Conservative government fulfils its September 2014 commitment to wider civic engagement about how England is governed.

It shows that over the past decade China and ASEAN have actively expanded cooperative frameworks and mechanisms in the domain of environmental protection as part of their comprehensive approach to sustainable development, particularly regarding energy projects. Nonetheless, the implementation record in their energy cooperation, that is, the lion's share of BRI projects in Southeast Asia, remains unsustainable and contradicts with their shared "green" policy discourse. The article examines factors from both sides of China and ASEAN that contribute to this disconnect and explains why China's own accomplishments in renewable energy development fail to spill over to Southeast Asia. These findings have implications for China's impact on global governance and its leadership role in the Global South.

ESG is important for stakeholders because it could be a risk management concern which impacted their decision making. For companies, it has become an emerging part of competitive strategy and lead to corporate sustainable development. The objective of the study is to investigate managers' perceptions of stakeholder power across different stakeholder groups in relation to ESG reporting by Malaysian companies. The data are obtained using questionnaire survey. There are sixty eight questionnaires collected from top managers of Malaysian public listed companies. The stakeholder theory underpinned this study. Employing analysis of variance, the result report a significant difference in managers' perceptions of stakeholder power across different stakeholder groups. Employees, shareholders and the government are perceived to have more power than customers, community and media in relation to ESG reporting. The findings help to provide a better basis for understanding on how managers' perceived on stakeholder power of different stakeholders with regard to ESG reporting.

It is the result of a combination of concepts from various alternative "sustainability" approaches and provides for the first time a set of detailed but not exhaustive aspects and sub-aspects that are critical for holistic implementation. A wide range of topics relevant for the attainment of radical change are embraced that had been rarely simultaneously considered in practice and research until now. Analyses at neighbourhood level in the solarCity (Linz, Austria) and Monges-Croix du Sud (Cornebarrieu, France), where SuDS have been comprehensively deployed, demonstrate the suitability of the tool for the provision of a more holistic perspective and direction for further change. Both projects represent the accomplishment of important steps towards sustainable stormwater management, but wider perspectives are required if the positive effects achieved are to be extended. Efforts have been made to understand the bio-physical traits of place prior to design and subsequently fulfil some technical demands, but reticence remains to: a) explore "closer to nature" solutions and transformative social considerations, and b) enter a continuous cycle of co-evolution.

Traditional multiple criteria group decision making (MCGDM) approaches to ERSE have been facing simultaneous challenging characteristics of decision hesitancy and prioritization relations among assessing criteria, due to the complexity in practical ERSE problems. Therefore, aiming at the special type of ERSE problems that hold the two characteristics, we investigate effective MCGDM approaches by hiring interval-valued dual hesitant fuzzy set (IVDHFS) to comprehensively depict decision hesitancy. To exploit decision information embedded in prioritization relations among criteria, we firstly define an fuzzy entropy measure for IVDHFS so that its derivative decision models can avoid potential information distortion in models based on classic IVDHFS distance measures with subjective supplementing mechanism; further, based on defined entropy measure, we develop two fundamental prioritized operators for IVDHFS by extending Yager's prioritized operators. Furthermore, on the strength of above methods, we construct two hesitant fuzzy MCGDM approaches to tackle complex scenarios with or without known weights for decision makers, respectively. Finally, case studies have been conducted to show effectiveness and practicality of our proposed approaches.

J	Sebastien, L				Sebastien, Lea			The Chagga people and environmental changes on Mount Kilimanjaro: Lessons to learn	CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						agroforestry; Chagga; environmental governance; hydrosystem; Kilimanjaro; social relations; sustainable development; territory	CLIMATE-CHANGE; TANZANIA; PANGANI; CONFLICTS; COMMONS; BASIN	Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa, is a site of exceptional diversity. However, its fragile balance is presently under threat, mainly from hydrological issues. Scientists and politicians have different hypotheses concerning the condition and availability of water on the mountain, thus far without consensus. Some of these hypotheses infer that the local Chagga communities living on Kilimanjaro's slopes are implicated in the overall degradation of natural resources. A major part of the research presented in this paper focuses on the Chagga people's view of their environment. The research uses the Actor in 4 Dimensions (A4D) methodology. This multidisciplinary conceptual model helps one to understand a territory by analysing the relations between individuals (social link) and the relations between humans and no humans (natural link). This paper aims to (1) present the A4D model and its innovative methodology, (2) analyse the stakeholders' dynamics around environmental issues on the mountain and (3) focus on the Chagga's perception of natural resource evolution and management. The A4D results show that the Chagga display a profound attachment to their territory, the forest is the element creating social relations, technical progress can mean social regression, conflicts over natural resources are increasing and hydrological risks on Mount Kilimanjaro are primarily of a social nature.

Rather than perceiving the transformative power of smart cities as a phenomenon particular to the use of new technologies, this paper aims to analyse societal segregation and marginalization through smart city development and traces these externalities as a continuation or intensification of existing governance practices. This is demonstrated by the case study on the metropolitan city of Bengaluru, that participates in India's national Smart City Mission. Due to massive urbanization, Bengaluru's peripheries are suffering from increasing pressures on its basic infrastructure. In response, state actors have turned to hybridizing the city's infrastructure facilities and governance to market- and civil society actors. Furthermore, the efforts of middle-class civil society groups that contribute to infrastructural governance through the assistance in planning, facilitation and controlling state responsibilities are institutionalized by bureaucratic state actors, at the cost of electoral governance by local representatives. This analysis on infrastructure governance in the peripheries has been set in relation to a discourse analysis of official policy documents on the inclusive and participatory character of smart cities. The practices of hybridization and institutionalization not only undermine the access to bask infrastructure for marginalized groups but also heavily underpin the design of Bengaluru's smart city projects. To be called inclusive, we argue that smart city projects should make an effort to improve the overall accessibilities of infrastructures for all classes and population groups.	[van Gils, Bart A.

J	Grainger, A; Konteh, W				Grainger, Alan; Konteh, William			Autonomy, ambiguity and symbolism in African politics: The development of forest policy in Sierra Leone	LAND USE POLICY			English	Review						sustainable tropical forest management; policy formulation model; forest policy development; democratization; civil war; governance; neo-patrimonial state; policy ambiguity; symbolic exchange; governmentality; international relations	ADVOCACY COALITION FRAMEWORK; WATTS,MICHAEL DEVELOPMENT; NATURAL-RESOURCES; GOVERNMENTALITY; STATE; GEOGRAPHIES; REFLECTIONS; PERSPECTIVE; DISCOURSE; NETWORKS	The stated forest policies of governments of developing countries, published in official documents, often differ from their actual policies. The historical trend in actual forest policy in Sierra Leone is explained by changes in the balance of pressures on policy makers from internal exploitative and protectionist groups. The combined trend in actual and stated policies is episodic, passing from the exploitative phase to the sustainable management (1911), ambiguous (1922), exploitative (1929), sustainable management (1946) and ambiguous phases (1968). This contrasts with the progression through exploitative, ambiguous and sustainable management phases seen in other countries. Divergence in colonial times from a stated policy of sustainable management, justified by a narrative framed within a colonial environmental discourse, mainly resulted from external pressure stemming from an Imperial discourse of political and economic security. Divergence in the post-colonial era is explained by lack of domestic ownership of colonial, and later eco-imperialist, forest policies, and the peripherality of policy texts of the institutional state to the 'shadow' neo-patrimonial state, which was the real centre of power and added institutional ambiguity to policy ambiguity as a tool to contest overseas pressures and defend national autonomy. There is no apparent link between divergence and type of political system, probably because of the pervasiveness of the neo-patrimonial state, though ambiguity was less prevalent in colonial times. Indigenous democratization and pluralization should help domestic protectionist groups to become more powerful, but external attempts to impose political change might be counterproductive by prompting further instrumental use of ambiguity.

Labour Migrants' Creative Entrepreneurship for Sustainable Livelihoods in Accra, Ghana	JOURNAL OF ASIAN AND AFRICAN STUDIES			English	Article						Urbanisation; globalisation; trade liberalisation; migration; livelihood; Accra	AFRICA; SOUTH; MIGRATION; DISASTER	Intra- and inter-regional migration is widely described. Prior studies have attribute varied reasons for this development including the quest for greener pastures and unequal development in northern Ghana. What has escaped critical scrutiny is some migrants' ability to escape extreme rural poverty, albeit in harsh urban environment. Such a missing gap can potentiate high policy failures, hence the need for academic attention. Using a mixed method, we focus on two informal daily livelihoods as exemplars - exceptionalism - in Accra. We see their embedded organisational vitality and dynamic networks as illuminating for good livelihood practices, proper city governance and fostering economic empowerment. We call on city authorities to take cognisance of such complexities and heterogeneity of production-labour relations, failure of which can spell doom for policies ostensibly initiated to curb migration, as they are likely to be underpinned by factual inaccuracies and may result in ill-fated interventions.

The paper is based on a case study of how the City of Stockholm has worked with integrating ICT solutions in the urban development project the Stockholm Royal Seaport (SRS). Through interviews with city officials and analysis of planning and policy documents we track how ICT became a part of the environmental program for the SRS, how this type of technology is conceived in terms of relation to the planning and implementation of other urban technologies, as well as what expected effects are highlighted. For this specific case we also distil some general lessons learned regarding what worked well and what did not. Finally, we draw conclusions regarding how ICT and sustainability can be merged in the planning phase of new urban developments and, ultimately, how a city administration can govern a city towards a Smart Sustainable City.

J	Marra, M				Marra, Mita			What coordination mechanisms work to manage regional development programmes? Insights from Southern Italian regions	EUROPEAN URBAN AND REGIONAL STUDIES			English	Article						Coordination; local development programmes; delegation; cooperation; institutional analysis	PARTNERSHIPS	The European Structural Fund programmes are embedded in a multi-level governance system, which has grown in parallel with European integration. Decision-making power is increasingly delegated to territorial authorities on the assumption that local agents possess both contextual knowledge and political legitimacy to integrate different policy measures in a cooperative fashion. Within contexts of structural socioeconomic constraints, problems of coordination are associated with policy co-formulation, governance network management, meta-governance processes, and performance management and evaluation use. This paper aims to examine the variety of coordination mechanisms adopted by regional government agencies in order to collaborate with local authorities to stimulate economically lagging territories. The paper analyses management techniques of local organizational capacity and network building, project development, monitoring and evaluation, highlighting the rationale of regional development policies and the role of institutions. Building upon 2 years of field research on local development programmes in four regions in the south of Italy, this paper shows that cooperation co-exists with opportunistic behaviour during programme design and implementation, while bureaucratic culture and organizational weaknesses hamper managerial leadership and administrative decentralization. Findings highlight that centrally guided decentralization is a more sustainable capacity-building strategy. Furthermore, perceived efficiency, equity, uncertainty, and relational quality shape coordination and its evolution over time. Interpersonal relations may increase to reduce uncertainty, or higher procedural formalization may ensure efficiency, equity, and fair dealings. The evolution of coordination mechanisms has a bearing on administrative capacity of public spending absorption against corruption and waste as well as on the potential for economic development and social cohesion.

The paper first highlights key characteristics of the prevailing paradigm associated with tourism industry expansion globally. It then identifies common elements of an alternative sustainable futures paradigm, contrasting its features with those of the established paradigm in relation to seven fundamental elements: neo-liberalism, anthropocentrism, shareholder orientation, growth, price, space and promotion. Next, the paper identifies the implications of the alternative paradigm in terms of the underpinning mindset (attitudes and behaviours) of major tourism stakeholders. Pathways to facilitate the transition to the new sustainable futures' paradigm are identified. The paper concludes with reflections on the power of the new paradigm, and its implications for a global sustainable tourism research and action agenda.

The idea of this conception establishes business activity due to social, environment and economic benefits. Sustainable rules point ways of exploring natural resources satisfying human needs and enabling business activity and its uninterrupted development. In purpose of realization sustainable development assumptions conception called corporate social responsibility was elaborated. With its help companies can describe best practices targeted on management operations on these human units, which take part in realized processes and those, on who these processes have influence. CSR idea concerns company community, as also external stakeholders. In terms of enterprise conception affects creating relations with employees, level of confidence building and implementing voluntary actions such as allowing personal growth and proving timely and proportional to qualifications remuneration. To a group of the most important regulations belong Social Accountability 8000, The Account Ability Stakeholder Engagement Standard and ISO 26000. Paper purpose is to distinguish these best practices being used by activity businesses for internal and external stakeholders.

J	McCormick, A				McCormick, Alexandra			Vanuatu Education Policy post-2015: 'alternative', decolonising processes for 'development'	INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION JOURNAL			English	Article						Vanuatu; Melanesia; education and development policy; SDGs; SIDS; youth	PACIFIC	This article is based on ongoing research in Vanuatu and the wider Pacific. It maps multilevel roles that education and development policy actors, and civil societies in particular, have increasingly been playing in official education and development policy activities. Most recently this has been in relation to the 'post-2015' agendas and processes that contributed to creating the 'sustainable development goals'. I argue that the decolonising discourses of self-reliance that gained traction in national independence movements have maintained emphasis in Vanuatu civil society and government approaches to national education and development policy. In considering these processes, I employ critical discourse analysis to interrogate some implications of current global(-ized) discourses and frameworks for education and development through lenses of decolonising regional histories and dynamic geo-political regional power relations. Dynamic, indigenous kastom beliefs and practices are central to most aspects of life for most ni-Vanuatu people (Regenvanu 2010). They have been a foundation for the recognition and revitalisation of the 'traditional economy' and 'alternative' visions of development (Malvatumauri National Council of Chiefs 2012). Related aspects of traditional/modern dialectics have long underpinned education and development processes and thinking; their negotiation at the interstices of complex economic, historical, and political changes through multi-level education, governance, and research relationships has been striking. The associated policy relationships are as rich and promising-and as disparate and varied-as those in the field of comparative and international education.

J	Schmitt, P; Wiechmann, T				Schmitt, Peter; Wiechmann, Thorsten			Unpacking Spatial Planning as the Governance of Place Extracting Potentials for Future Advancements in Planning Research	DISP			English	Article							SOFT SPACES; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; TERRITORIAL GOVERNANCE; MULTILEVEL GOVERNANCE; ADAPTIVE GOVERNANCE; POLICIES; MODES; INTEGRATION; EVOLUTION; NETWORKS	Since the 1990s, the concept of governance has become an integral element of spatial planning research. In this article, we revisit some of the key contributions to the literature to discuss how and to what extent governance theory has informed planning theory so far and what the implications are for our understanding of how to construe planning practices. Next, we examine the current governance literature in order to identify promising elements that can further inform planning theory and practice. More specifically, we discuss relations between hybrid modes of governance in regard to cross-sectoral coordination of actors and institutions, and the implications of various forms of learning within governance networks. Finally, we suggest entry points for planning research such as studying the combination and interplay of various modes of governance to understand the inherent functioning of spatial planning assemblages, or investigating the learning capacity of actors and institutions in order to anticipate their adaptive capacity' to respond to changing contexts in spatial planning practice. However, we also point out a few, yet troublesome implications. One of them is that planning understood as the governance of place might imply that the term "planning" as such becomes meaningless and that planning theory might turn into a subsection of (institutional) political theory. The article serves as a framing text for this special issue as it addresses a number of key elements and underlying concepts of the governance literature that are relevant for understanding the procedural dimension of spatial planning and which underpin some of the issues that are addressed in the more case study-based contributions by the other authors.

Extractive entanglements and regimes of accountability at an undeveloped mining project	RESOURCES POLICY			English	Article						Copper; Papua New Guinea; Corporate social responsibility; Community relations and development; Mineral governance	CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; COMMUNITY-RELATIONS; INTERNAL DIMENSIONS; OIL; CSR; BUSINESS; PAPUA	This paper uses a case study of Community Relations and Development (CRD) field practitioners at the Frieda River Project - an advanced copper and gold exploration venture in the upper Sepik region of Papua New Guinea - to contrast the professional arenas in which corporate social responsibility (CSR) mechanisms tend to be strategically developed, and the deeply relational contexts in which they are implemented on the ground, in the project location. It provides insights into experiences of site-level CRD personnel tasked with implementation of community relations and development programmes, and offers an audit of their perceptions regarding their role and the value they bring to the design of complex orebody projects. The article explores the role of 'CSR' and `sustainable development' in the framing of the company's engagement with local stakeholders - assessed from the perspective of CRD officers. Contextualising research material within debates about CSR in the resource extraction industry, the paper shows that while the discourse of CSR was ultimately born out of acknowledgements of companies' entanglements in their wider operating environments, its mechanisms can be used to promote the ethics of detachment, and may serve to distance companies from the complexities of the environments in which they operate.

J	Browning, CS				Browning, Christopher S.			Nation branding and development: poverty panacea or business as usual?	JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Africa; development; globalisation; identity; nation branding	POLITICS; PLACE; STATE	According to nation branding consultants, problems of underdevelopment and global inequality are, to a significant extent, a product of the negative images peddled by charities and the broader development industry. While such images secure donations, it is argued they deter more sustainable investments. In contrast, consultants argue that concerted nation-branding strategies offer much better solutions to problems of underdevelopment. This article subjects such claims to critical examination and argues that while the diagnosis of the problem may have some merit, the solution offered is more problematic. This is because nation-branding practices are inherently status quo oriented and reflective of a neoliberal understanding of the nature of (under)development. Moreover, nation branding also entails a troubling commodification of identity and culture as well as unsettling implications in respect of extant understandings of 'good governance'. Finally, the article suggests that the dichotomy drawn between aid and nation branding cannot be upheld; rather, it is a device used to legitimise a market for the services of nation-branding consultants.

Sustainability, Sociocultural Challenges, and New Power of Capitalism for Renewable Energy Megaprojects in an Indigenous Mayan Community of Mexico	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						sustainable development; energy democracy; indigenous community; renewable energy megaprojects; social resistance; energetic capitalism	TRANSITION; INJUSTICE	Sustainable development is an integrated blend of energetic, economic, social, environmental, and governmental actors, making it one of the most challenging and subjective aims of the United Nations. A sustainability project that does not consider any of these parameters can generate resistance among different actors of society. In this work, we have demonstrated that the traditional definition of sustainability encompassing economic development, environmental protection, and social justice does not adequately cover large-scale renewable energy projects. We have presented an illuminating case study of solar development in the Yucatan state of Mexico to show that the traditional three-legged stool of sustainable development fails to accommodate local power relations and their role in energy decision-making. This point is made through a substantive and illuminating ethnography of a solar project in the community of San Jose Tipceh, which involves the importance of energy democracy and understanding power relations in any assessment of sustainable development. These power relations are an important component of sustainable development, and all megaprojects, especially renewable energy projects, require special attention in the governance processes. Through an analysis of an example of implementation of a mega solar project, we argue that the methodology through which the power is exercised is an exercise of great importance because it leads us to a scientific discussion that structures an international reflection on sustainability. The case study consists of mixed methods, including several techniques to deepen the analysis of sociocultural aspects, and tries to present the limits and show the weakness of the sustainability perspective in such megaprojects. It is concluded that environmental justice as a basic element of the new era of renewable energies is limited and can generate social injustices. In the same way, this work shows how power is exercised in the implementation of energy projects and in the absence of equitable comprehensive governance that does not consider the local sociocultural contexts of the communities, resulting in the generation of new powers and permanent conflicts. At the end of this work, a framework to empower local sociocultural contexts for an equitable energy transition is recommended.

J	Sun, HY				Sun Haiyong			U.S.-China Tech War Impacts and Prospects	CHINA QUARTERLY OF INTERNATIONAL STRATEGIC STUDIES			English	Article						Technological war; Trump administration; China-U.S. relations; global governance		The Trump administration has waged a technological war against China due to the differences between China and the United States in political values and geopolitical pursuits, as well as their rivalry on regional and global arenas. The United States regards itself as being on the moral high ground in the existing international order and intends to force China to abandon its policies in high-tech industries and technology transfer from foreign enterprises, in order to maintain its global supremacy. With a zero-sum mentality, the Trump administration is trying to use the leverage of advanced science and technology to maximize benefits for the United States in trade with China. Its tech war attempts against China mainly include trade sanctions, investment control, export control, and restrictions on the exchange of technological personnel. These moves will further harm China-U.S. security relations as well as their science and technology cooperation and undermine the regional situation and global science and technology governance. In order to promote sustainable global development and strategic stability, both sides need to undertake more effective efforts to manage their strategic competition, build a more balanced and mutually beneficial relationship in high-tech industries, and expand the space for cooperation in the field of global science and technology governance.

This paper presents the results of an interdisciplinary research project that used semi-structured interviews with practitioners, academics and community leaders to critically investigate the interactions between people and landscape in Bogot ' a. The paper aims to deepen the understanding of the social and ecological processes that are constantly intertwined in the occupation and appropriation of the landscape. Using the Limas Creek as a case study, the paper explores the technological constraints, governance structures, cultural values and community agency around the restoration of rivers and the implementation of green infrastructure in low-income settlements in Bogot ' a. The research highlights the need to explore the demands of co-production and its relation to the challenges of sustainable development. The paper demonstrates that, in addition to sustainable solutions to water management, there is also a need to develop strategies around education, landscape attachment and environmental awareness. This is seen as a first step towards the re-articulation of the relationship between people and water in the urban realm to ultimately guarantee environmental justice.

This paper reports on the outputs of a participatory stakeholders' engagement platform that was designed to draw on local farmers' knowledge and experience in identifying sustainable pathways for the development of multi-functional agroforestry in Guadeloupe. Two participatory workshops were organised that aimed to gain insights into the reality faced by farmers, in particular: (i) their vision of the future, needs and aspirations; (ii) their understanding of barriers and enablers in relation to the sustainability challenges they are confronted with and; (iii) their framing of human-environment relationships in socio-ecological systems. Outputs of the activities were synthetized by the research team and represented graphically for analysis. Results show that while farmers envision prosperous multifunctional forest farms in the future, they have to face complex challenges that require solutions at multiple scales and suggest different types of innovation: social, institutional, market-based and technical. Farmers saw themselves as being part of the socio-ecological system and as custodians of the natural environment. We discuss the implications of those results in the context of the absence of a system of innovation for agroforestry in Guadeloupe and highlight the opportunity for a innovation ecosystem thinking approach that integrates better the agricultural and forestry sectors, but also between actors and scales of governance. Implementation of a Stewardship status would enable farmers achieve their vision and embrace a custodian role vis-a-vis the agroforest. Embededment of the stakeholders' engagement platform and its enabling processes in the innovation ecosystem is key to achieve those objectives.

This paper tracks the genesis of a landscape approach to heritage conservation, and then presents a systematic review of the literature on the HUL. More than 100 publications from 2010 to early 2018 were analysed. The applied methodology combined an inductive categorization method with a deductive data mining method. The objective is to determine whether the academic discussion is addressing the different dimensions of the HUL approach, including the holistic, integrated, and value-based dimensions, and whether it is progressing through time to move from a conceptual to an operational level. Results show that while the discussion is heavily focused on values, the operationalization of a value-based approach is still lacking, as it is not fully contextualized in relation to local heritage discourses and the dynamics of heritage governance. Results also show that many case studies applications are in 'non-Western' cities, thus opening the debate about the accountability of a value-based approach in contexts that tend to be dominated by groups with the most political power, and where conservation practices mainly focus on the mobilization of material heritage to foster its economic value. Nevertheless, the transition from international guidelines to contextualized local endeavours and policies remains a challenge to be solved.

Design/methodology/approach A two-stage methodology is followed. First, the key factors for neighbourhood are identified from literature studies. The selected factors are validated by sample t-tests. Second, the total interpretive structural modeling is used to interpret the complexity of relationships among various factors. Further, cross-impact matrix multiplication is applied for classification analysis to find the most driving factors for neighbourhood design. Findings The contribution of this research is to show hierarchical relationships among the various factors to design the neighbourhood places as smart from the perspectives of city planners and decision makers. Research limitations/implications The applicability of the research findings is limited to developing countries mainly where population is large and most of cities have high pressure on its infrastructure to fulfil the citizens' demands. Practical implications This paper will aid policymakers, city planners and government officials to design a sustainable smart city model in which smart neighbourhood would also be the potential solution to decrease pressure on a city's critical infrastructure especially in developing countries. Social implications A smart city could be considered as the centre point of smart initiatives to develop a place smart, and it should continue beyond the city boundaries to enhance the facilities, services, resources utilization and working environment in neighbourhood places also. Originality/value The study explores the various literature on neighbourhood planning and then link with smart city development as current need of urban development scenario. The authors propose a hierarchical relation framework to develop the neighbourhood places as smart places to meet the future demand of urbanization in developing countries like India.

Many cities worldwide are involved; they start to reconsider their current food supply system. This study will describe some developments in the Cologne-Bonn area, Germany, which have the potential to introduce new pathways for more sustainable food futures. Recent developments in urban food systems in the Cologne-Bonn region are very much "bottom-up", driven by lively and committed actors (gardeners, farmers, civil society). In this paper potential synergies and conflicts in the emerging urban agriculture activities, focusing on producer-consumer relations and evolving co-productive approaches are discussed. We further try to understand motivations, aims and visions of the diverse participants of such models. By using qualitative methods of empirical social research such as narratives and semi-structured interviews primary data were collected in the case region. Until now there is no consensus in the literature about the optimal institutional set-ups for the permanent adoption of the various forms of urban agriculture. Preliminary governance analysis showed that especially institutionalized forms seem to be robust and sustainable. The further exploration of the cases will also contribute to understand the dynamics coming from the involvement of citizens in the agricultural production. Co-productive or participatory agriculture, which includes the consumer into the production process, has the potential to change the way of urban food supply. It is hypothesized that shared motivations and visions between producers and consumers in favor of a sustainable food system will help to stabilize alternative food systems whereas conflicts need to be anticipated to deepen the understanding of problems in the producer-consumer co-productive process. Our first results demonstrate that co-productive models of today are primarily based on idealism from both sides and also bear the potential of conflicts. It will be up to further research and innovation to address these issues and also check the new approaches on economic viability.

J	Karvonen, A				Karvonen, Andrew			Metronatural (TM): Inventing and reworking urban nature in Seattle	PROGRESS IN PLANNING			English	Article						Seattle; Water; Environmental politics; Urban nature; Sustainable development; Expertise	PACIFIC-NORTHWEST; UNITED-STATES; CITY; TECHNOLOGY; WATER; MODERNIZATION; REFLECTIONS; POLITICS; PROMISE; SEARCH	Seattle has long been considered a city in harmony with nature, a metropolis inseparable from and infused with the dramatic and picturesque Pacific Northwest landscape. Today, the city is frequently cited as a leader in sustainable urban development and this is due in large part to its unique relationship with its natural surroundings. However, the historical record of Seattle reveals this harmonious relationship between humans and nature to be a social construction. The founders of Seattle adopted an urban development approach similar to other North American cities and implemented large-scale engineering projects to rationalise the landscape while solidifying the municipal government as the ultimate arbiter of human/nature relations. The unintended economic, environmental, and social consequences of this so-called 'Promethean' approach to urban nature would be debunked in the 1950s, catalyzing a wide array of approaches by the municipality and residents to restore, protect, and live with nature in more benign ways. In this article. I examine the politics of nature in Seattle to understand how changing perceptions of the urban landscape are related to different forms of expertise, governance, and citizenship. I focus specifically on activities to reorient urban water flows because they reveal the multiple tensions between humans and nature. The article adds to contemporary scholarship in landscape architecture, human geography, and environmental history on the dilemma of urban nature while highlighting the central role of technical experts, practices, and networks as well as issues of governance, citizenship, and management. Seattle's reputation as a green metropolis serves as an entry point to interpret the various relationships between humans, technology, and nature while also suggesting potential routes to realise more sustainable urban futures.

Local government disaster training exercises serve as a window through which to view these relations, and social capital' is used as an analytic for making sense of the human relations at the core of disaster management operations. These elements help to expose and substantiate the often intangible relations that compose the culture that exists, and that is shaped by preparations for disasters. The study reveals how this social capital has been generated through personal interactions, which are shared among disaster managers across different organisations and across levels' within those organisations. Recognition of these group resources' has significant implications for disaster management in which conducive social relations have become paramount. The paper concludes that socio-cultural relations, as well as a people-centred approach to preparations, appear to be effective means of readying for, and ultimately responding to, disasters.

J	Keskinen, M; Varis, O				Keskinen, Marko; Varis, Olli			Institutional cooperation at a basin level: For what, by whom? Lessons learned from Cambodia's Tonle Sap Lake	NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM			English	Article						Institutional coordination; institutional reform; basin organization; environmental governance; sustainable development; Mekong River Basin	GOVERNANCE; MANAGEMENT; INTEGRATION; REGION; SCALE	Water is fundamental for the development of any society. Several concepts in water management promote integration, cooperation and a basin-wide approach as a means to achieve sustainable development of water resources. Management institutions aiming to put these concepts into practice are developed around the world, with varying success. This paper looks at the institutional setting in the Tonle Sap Lake area in Cambodia, and analyses three initiatives for establishing a coordinating organization for the lake basin. Due to the significance of the Tonle Sap to the entire country and the transboundary Mekong River Basin, the area's management is an important yet contested issue. Our study indicates that while the discussion about the most suitable forms of management revolves around commonly accepted ideals of cooperation and sustainability, the actual drivers for institutional reforms are strongly influenced by the existing institutions and their political rivalries and interests. Following, the basin-wide approach currently dominant in water management for good and logical reasons can actually hinder institutional cooperation, as the existing institutional hegemons may see it as a threat to their mandate. We therefore argue that a process seeking to establish a new basin organization should pay particular attention to the existing institutions, including the way the differing scales, levels and boundaries within the basin affect their relations.

Reflecting on a collaborative approach to a regional sustainability transition: Dingle Peninsula 2030	REFLECTIVE PRACTICE			English	Article						Collaborative governance; reflection; reflective practice; sustainability; reflective learning	GOVERNANCE; POWER	This paper uses a reflective method to gather findings with relation to a collaborative governance approach for the sociotechnical transition to a low carbon society in a regional context. As top-down and bottom-up approaches to sustainable transitions have proven insufficient in bringing about the necessary changes required to meet the demands of climate action, more collaborative approaches between local communities, national public bodies and research organisations are warranted. Within this, there is a need to understand the dynamics of collaborative governance for participants in the process. Through a process of reflective practice, this paper outlines the networks, personal capacities, organisational capacities, benefits and challenges of collaborative governance partnerships for sustainable transitions from the perspective of individuals within a collaborative committee working on a regional transition project on the Dingle Peninsula, Co Kerry, Ireland. Alongside this, some solutions to challenges outlined through reflection are highlighted. This research paper highlights the need for the incorporation of reflective practice within collaborative governance for the socio-technical transition to a low-carbon society.

Impact evaluation of a fisheries development project	MARINE POLICY			English	Article						Fisheries; Coastal communities; Development; Fisheries performance indicators; Liberia	DEVELOPING-WORLD; FOOD SECURITY; TRADE; FISH; COUNTRIES; SEAFOOD; HEALTH	A number of fisheries development projects are undertaken every year in recognition of the important role fisheries play in many coastal communities. The objectives vary, but typically go beyond a limited focus on fisheries management and the ecosystem. This makes it difficult to evaluate the contribution of a project, particularly in data poor environments such as most developing countries. This paper used the recently developed Fisheries Performance Indicators (FPIs) to evaluate the impact of a World Bank development project in a Liberian coastal community. FPIs are designed to capture economic and social performance of a fisheries system in addition to the management and environmental impacts. The results show improvements in most ecological dimensions, and also in many social and economic dimensions targeted by the project. Hence, the project intervention appears to be positive. However, some indicators, particularly in relation to general governance in Liberia, showed a negative development which was not caused by the project.

J	DOIG, A				DOIG, A			GOOD GOVERNMENT AND SUSTAINABLE ANTI-CORRUPTION STRATEGIES - A ROLE FOR INDEPENDENT ANTI-CORRUPTION AGENCIES	PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							REFORM	Aid donors are increasingly seeking to link assistance to sustainable reform, including the provision of a responsible and responsive political and legal framework, the improvement of recipient countries' social, health and educational prospects, and the promotion of economic development and liberalization. Much attention is given to the first of these because of the size and cost to the state and the perceived constraints it exercises on the longer-term changes to the economy and society; in general terms, good government is an essential precondition for good governance and economic development. Increasingly donors have focused on corruption, both as a core obstacle to the encouragement of good government, and on the steps taken to dealing with it as evidence of commitment and the will of recipient countries to their introduction. While the types of activity associated with corruption are readily identifiable, as are the means to attempt to deal with it, it is usually much more difficult to determine effective implementation, particularly with limited resources at a time when longer-term political and economic reforms are also being promoted. It is therefore especially important that, in relation to corruption and good government, a practicable, effective and sustainable means is available to deal with corruption from preventative, investigative and reform perspectives.

The biophysical systems upon which we are totally dependent have not been challenged by human activities at the global scale before and our impacts upon those planetary systems, as well as upon our social systems, cannot be adequately addressed by ad hoc solutions. Science and leadership will be required to address this threat and transform our current societies into sustainable societies. This Special Volume presents an evolving, yet increasingly cohesive, science-based perspective on leadership towards sustainability. Examples of crucial, overall questions addressed by authors of articles in this Special Volume are: How can science help to clarify sustainability as a foundational platform for success for society's core institutions (e.g. business, governance and education), and how can this platform inform envisioning, planning, monitoring, communication and decision making to accelerate the needed transitions? The conceptual framing of sustainable development in this Special Volume is based upon the logic that it is only if we can define sustainability in a scientifically solid way, as a frame for any vision, that we can analyze current situations in relation to such sustainable visions, and design strategies to close the gap to such visions. In moving from current situations towards possible sustainable futures, specific support in the form of leadership concepts, methods, tools, and requirements are also essential, i.e. given clarity around what needs to be achieved, effective leadership then requires knowing how to achieve it. Both the what and the how questions are addressed in this Special Volume. The research described provides a foundation for moving from ad hoc activities to systemic, systematic and strategic transitions towards sustainability. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This article draws on a case study of the Ongatoro Maketu estuary restoration initiative in Aotearoa, New Zealand, to examine how shifting discourses of nature and the environment intersect with the exercise of power to influence decision-making on the estuary. The study is based on a qualitative analysis of an archive of historical policy and planning documents, and 25 in-depth interviews with participants involved in the restoration initiative. The analysis demonstrates that despite a participatory process that often reinforced the dominant cultural paradigm and power relations, it created the space for different knowledge forms including western science and Maori knowledge to help improve the quality of decisions. We argue that well-designed participatory processes have much potential to address the growing complexity and uncertainty underpinning environmental governance and management.

Yet, technologies are neither developed nor applied to governance problems in a socio-political vacuum. Despite aspirations to provide novel solutions to current sustainability governance challenges, many technology-centred projects, pilots and plans remain implicated in longer-standing global governance trends shaping the possibilities for success in often under-recognized ways. This article identifies three overlapping contexts within which technology-led efforts to address sustainability challenges are evolving, highlighting the growing roles of: (1) private actors; (2) experimentalism; and (3) informality. The confluence of these interconnected trends illuminates an important yet often under-recognized paradox: that the use of technology in multi-stakeholder initiatives tends to reduce rather than expand the set of actors, enhancing instead of reducing challenges to participation and transparency, and reinforcing rather than transforming existing forms of power relations. Without recognizing and attempting to address these limits, technology-led multi-stakeholder initiatives will remain less effective in addressing the complexity and uncertainty surrounding global sustainability governance. We provide pathways for interrogating the ways that novel technologies are being harnessed to address long-standing global sustainability issues in manners that foreground key ethical, social and political considerations and the contexts in which they are evolving.

Liquefied natural gas production at Hammerfest: A transforming marine community	MARINE POLICY			English	Article						Coalitions; Marine community; Small Island Developing State; Sustainable development; Hammerfest	ORGANIZATIONS	Global energy demand and scarce petroleum resources require communities to adapt to a rapidly changing Arctic environment, but as well to a transforming socio-economic environment instigated by oil and gas development. This is illustrated by liquefied natural gas production by Statoil at Hammerfest, which opened up the Barents Sea for oil and gas drilling. Although environmental organisations, Sarni indigenous people, fisheries and local inhabitants of Hammerfest try to strive for environmental and community development in relation to liquefied natural gas production by engaging in negotiations with Statoil and the Norwegian government, they are overshadowed by economic growth, implemented by a strong coalition between Statoil and the Norwegian State. Sustainable development of liquefied natural gas production is therefore constrained by centralized decision-making by the institutional coalition. Statoil's concessions on environmental and community development were rather based on cost-efficient and short-term means. This is strengthened by the fact that contact with stakeholders faded away once the social license to operate was achieved. This article will analyse why current governance of liquefied natural gas production at Hammerfest did not move beyond economic development. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Advancing the Disaster and Development Paradigm	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK SCIENCE			English	Article						Disaster and development paradigm; Disaster risk reduction; Disaster risk management; Local action research	RISK; VULNERABILITY; GOVERNANCE; RESILIENCE	Consolidation of disaster and development studies as an integrated field of action research that influences policy has proved to be fundamental to global disaster risk reduction, sustainable development, climate change, and humanitarian agreements. However, challenges in achieving targets, such as those of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals, requires further advances of the disaster and development paradigm underpinning these aspirations. This article presents perspectives that grew primarily from local action research, particularly research carried out with marginalized and highly at-risk groups of people in Southern Africa and South Asia. Analytical fronts from these findings emphasize disaster and development risk assessment opportunities that consolidate earlier ideas and extend understanding of disaster and development-related risk intervention options. These acknowledge severe shortcomings in disaster risk reduction progress while including greater use of hope as an active ingredient. This process of paradigm exploration remains fundamental to achieving disaster risk reduction, sustainable development, and associated policy objectives. The analysis presented here reiterates earlier groundings in people-centric perspectives, emphasizing social relations and systems of meaning as essential active ingredients for challenging power structures, technology, education, and human behavior. The analysis proposes some consequent thematic fronts for increased investment. These include investing in early buildup of well-being before a disaster, better living with uncertainty, and overcoming the barriers to desired disaster and development outcomes. The article is intended to contribute to an ever-evolving paradigm of disaster and development risk that requires impetus from personal and collective values beyond calculations of disaster and development.

J	Medd, W; Marvin, S				Medd, Will; Marvin, Simon			Strategic intermediation: Between regional strategy and local practice	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Water Framework Directive; sustainable water management; networked infrastructures; intermediaries		The core aspiration of the WFD is that through a focus on hydrological boundaries the development of integrated river basin management (IRBM) will overcome the previously fragmented directives relevant to water and develop a more holistic approach to sustainable water management. In this paper we focus on the significant role that intermediary organizations, often neglected in conventional analysis, play in water governance processes. We use three case study examples of intermediaries working in the North-West of England to illustrate the importance of understanding their work in translating sustainable water management from regional strategy to local practice. Critically, the work of intermediaries across different scales of practice involves a complex array of negotiation, (re) representation and translation of what 'sustainable water management' becomes in relation to different contexts. Their strength comes in their ability to adapt their relationship to water into different sets of interests and contexts without necessarily integrating these interests.

The present study demystifies the relation of sustainability and food security and structurally identifies the sustainable drivers, and the pragmatic interventions that can critically contribute to the sustainability of food security within each stage of the FSC. A systematic review of articles from six databases was implemented. Thematic analysis was engaged to detect the sustainable drivers and interventions practised at each stage in the FSC for food security purposes. Six main themes of the drivers and interventions were derived from the analysis: food security governance involvement, input resource management, output management, information sharing, income, and technology. The result identifies the potential that quality management has on the mediating effect towards sustainable food security, through which a conceptual model for sustainable food security in the FSC was thus developed. It is deduced that mapping and categorizing the drivers and intervention of sustainable food securities could help deepen the understanding of effective and innovative practices towards food security in the FSC.

Michael			Just Because It Seems Impossible, Doesn't Mean We Shouldn't At Least Try: The Need for Longitudinal Perspectives on Tourism Partnerships and the SDGs	JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM			English	Article						Sustainable development goals; India; public-private partnership; community development; policy process; values; partnership flow model	PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; DEVELOPMENT GOALS; LIFE-CYCLE; GOVERNANCE; FRAMEWORKS; POWER	Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 17 highlights the importance that the partnership narrative plays in the implementation of SDGs. However, given the brevity of many development projects, these partnerships are often developed and concluded rapidly, with little attention given to longer-term implications or success. This paper argues that in order to create and develop partnerships that properly address the SDGs, it is imperative that a process perspective is developed that takes into account the range of stakeholders and interests, values, and the power relations between actors prior to and during the project together with a comprehensive understanding of what is success. This requires a full awareness of the project's context and previous interventions, activities, and policies. In order to illustrate the necessity of longitudinal partnerships and perspectives, a case study, a community-based development project in New Delhi, India, is used. The goal of the project has been to ensure that the community is actively involved in the entire process, eventually becoming owners of the interventions so that, when the project and partnership eventually ends, the community continues to benefit. Examples from the project are used to emphasize the importance of long-term planning and partnership driven by context-specificity, implementation processes and policy-awareness.

This article describes how European CSOs (including trade union organizations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs)) respond to these developments. It argues that European civil society is witnessing a threefold shift in priorities of labour-standards advocacy: from pushing regulatory approaches to organizational capacity building; from corporate responsibility strategies focused on compliance to strategies focused on transparency; and from fair labour standards within the sustainable development agenda to a host of other issues. The overall result is that labour-standards advocacy in general and private labour governance in particular are receiving less attention from European CSOs.

These practices address subaltern local and Indigenous actors, seek their compliance and thereby contribute to the stabilization of otherwise all-too-fragile global carbon governance systems. In this article I analyze the governing effects of such practices by drawing on Robert Fletcher's concept of "multiple environmentalities" and Tania Murray Li's "analytic of assemblage." Empirically I focus on educational materials that have been designed for REDD+ projects in cooperation with one of the world's largest REDD+ funds, Norway's International Climate and Forest Initiative. I identify several strategies that aim at aligning diverse actors, seek to de- or re-politicize REDD+ concepts, authorize knowledge, and, most significantly, address local actors as responsible ecological stewards, who contribute to stabilizing REDD+ regimes on the ground. In total, these strategies promote programmatic subjectivities among Indigenous 'stakeholders' and contribute to a new, 'glocal' understanding of nature-society relations.

Utilising a sample of 115 leading national newspapers covering forty-one countries, we show that typically no homogeneous global trends exist with regard to sustainability-related media agendas. Instead, significant differences exist regarding the national-level prioritisations of sustainability-related issues in the countries under review. To some extent, these observed differences can be attributed to different levels of socioeconomic development as measured by Human Development Index scores and gross domestic product per capita. Here, generic differences can be identified between newspapers from the Global North and South, with a range of issues such as climate change emerging as typically Northern issues, whereas issues such as corruption and poverty show significantly higher levels of coverage across newspapers from the Global South. We conclude with a discussion of the results in the context of global environmental governance.

J	Wilson, CE; Morrison, TH; Everingham, JA				Wilson, Ceit E.; Morrison, Tiffany H.; Everingham, Jo-Anne			Multi-Scale Meta-Governance Strategies for Addressing Social Inequality in Resource Dependent Regions	SOCIOLOGIA RURALIS			English	Article							CHALLENGES; GOVERNMENT; FAILURE; AGENDAS	Social inequality in resource-dependent regions is a growing problem. Increasingly both state and private actors are acting as meta-governors to address the issue. In this article, we focus on housing inequality as the canary in the coalmine' for broader social inequality. While affordable housing has been the subject of growing attention in urban scholarship, relatively few studies have considered the governance of affordable housing in rural regions. We report on a case analysis of affordable housing governance in the Gladstone-Surat Region, a traditional agricultural area of Australia that has experienced a dramatic increase in housing inequality due to significant coal seam gas development in recent years. We show that networked arrangements for affordable housing delivery were the product of strategic policy structuring, resourcing, and hands-off framing by the state government. Private meta-governance was exercised only in relation to process management forms of meta-governance, with private companies facilitating local arenas' for stakeholder discussion and connecting stakeholders in a synergistic manner. The dynamics of the case-study examined demonstrate that meta-governance in rural regions is not just about coordinating and mobilising horizontal (e.g., regional) cooperation, but about coalescing action within multiscale exogenous' networks and structures. These findings have important implications for future efforts to address social inequality in rural areas.

J	Howson, P				Howson, Peter			Crypto-giving and surveillance philanthropy: Exploring the trade-offs in blockchain innovation for nonprofits	NONPROFIT MANAGEMENT & LEADERSHIP			English	Article						Blockchain; Cryptocurrency; development; fundraising; governance; surveillance		A blockchain is a smart electronic database, distributed to all users, immutably tracking every transaction that has ever taken place between nodes on a network. The technology is being used by some nonprofits to address various operational challenges, including attaching automated conditions to charitable donations facilitated by programmable "crypto-giving" platforms. Drawing from analysis of technical documents provided by active crypto-giving projects, this review considers how these platforms enable radical shifts in sectoral power relations through "surveillance philanthropy". This algorithmic surveillance ensures project funding fully reflects the interests of donors, while potentially restricting nonprofits in meeting the dynamic and complex needs of project beneficiaries. The paper considers the benefit trade-offs from crypto-giving platforms in three areas of utilization: (a) new forms of donor engagement and fundraising, (b) new tools for organizational governance, and (c) novel provision of development assistance. Despite the possible efficiency and transparency benefits of crypto-giving platforms, more research and practitioner engagement is required to ensure the sector's funding is secure and sustainable, without entailing significant risks for proposed beneficiaries.

J	Dancer, H				Dancer, Helen			Harmony with Nature: towards a new deep legal pluralism	JOURNAL OF LEGAL PLURALISM AND UNOFFICIAL LAW			English	Article						Earth jurisprudence; ecosystem services; legal pluralism; Rights of Nature; sustainable development	RIGHTS	Through a lens of legal pluralism, this article examines the histories, ontologies and discourses that have shaped two contrasting approaches to human-Earth relations in debates and legal frameworks for sustainable development. Anthropocentric discourses of nature as service-provider underpin the dominant approaches within ecology and economics. Ecocentric discourses of Nature as subject are reflected in Rights of Nature movements, particularly in the Americas, and at an international level, in the United Nations Harmony with Nature Programme. Drawing particularly on examples from forest governance in global and national contexts, this article analyses the ways in which international organisations and states have instrumentalised and embedded these discourses in law and policy and reflects on the challenges and possibilities for pluricultural legal orders, Rights of Nature and sustainable development. Moving away from conventional understandings of rights and entitlement to natural resources, the article argues for a deep legal pluralism that both decentres anthropocentric thinking on the environment and decentres the state in the development of Earth law. This places responsibility for the environment and the equitable sharing of power at the heart of legal frameworks on human-Earth relations and recognises the diversity of ontologies that shape these relationships in law and practice.

However, key forestry stakeholders often hold different, and sometimes conflicting, expectations in relation to forest management policies and management objectives. Applying the triple-perspective typology of stakeholder theory, this paper assessed the evolution of "Scientific Forest Management" (SciFM), a signature programme of the Nepalese Government, as well as its policy processes and explored compatibility, complexity, cost and relative advantages of the adoption of SciFM. The government believes that without this programme, Nepal is losing 91 Million US Dollar (USD) per year. This study revealed that participation of key stakeholders remained contested from the beginning of its implementation, primarily due to differences they held in understanding and interpretation of SciFM. Although stakeholders' views converged on the potential role of SciFM to increase forest product supply and the domination of timber-centric management, their perspectives differed in nomenclature and implementation modality of SciFM. Primarily, the community forest users and their networks did not own the concept from the beginning, as they were suspicious of recentralization and bureaucratic dominance in forest governance through SciFM. Since historically ingrained skepticism in both government officials and community forest users' networks towards each other has negatively influenced the trust-building environment, the management of stakeholders' relations through frequent and meaningful deliberations, and the simplification of bureaucratic procedures in implementation and capacity development of key actors could be instrumental in achieving SciFM objectives.

J	Archer, M				Archer, Matthew			How to govern a sustainable supply chain: Standards, standardizers, and the political ecology of (in)advertence	ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING E-NATURE AND SPACE			English	Article						Sustainability; standards; governance; stakeholders; political ecology; intentionality	UNEQUAL EXCHANGE; POWER; CERTIFICATION; TRADE	There is an ambivalence within political ecology about whether the unequal power relations that emerge from many development projects are intended or unintended. This ambivalence is a result of an empirical focus on the effects of these programs on target communities, as opposed to an empirical focus on the people who are responsible for developing those programs. Drawing on qualitative fieldwork among people tasked with designing, promoting, and enforcing sustainability standards in global agricultural supply chains, I argue that the empowerment of multinational corporations and well-funded environmental NGOs that characterizes market-oriented sustainability programs is, in fact, intentional. This intention reflects the belief among sustainability professionals that the intersection of western scientific expertise with the dynamics of "the market" is the most effective way to promote sustainability in global supply chains, and to generate global sustainability in a more general sense. Concepts like "stakeholder engagement" and a commitment to flexibility and accommodation in the development and adoption of social and environmental standards are examples of what I call euphemistic sustainability, which shifts critical attention away from a balance of power that is increasingly tilted toward private interests, even as that imbalance remains an intended outcome of non-state market-driven governance systems like ostensibly voluntary sustainability standards.

Due to the small size of the units, land management and planning are difficult from both the private and the public point of view. In some regions of Europe, land fragmentation can lead to the collapse of land-based activities such as agriculture and forestry. This process triggers land abandonment, which causes social, economic and environmental problems. Traditional interventions such as land consolidation have not worked because of the scale of land fragmentation, which leads to huge transaction costs. New planning instruments and governance structures for land management dun balance the relations between property rights, management and labour force can be developed, in order to avoid the problems of land fragmentation. In this paper, we present two innovative examples of land management and governance structures for dealing with land fragmentation in rural areas of Galicia northwestern Spain. They were able to combine the use of individual and common property rights to make land use more sustainable, instead of trying to change land ownership. The new governance structures helped to increase efficiency and sustainability of the land mire by, for example, increasing labour productivity, clarifying property rights and diminishing land abandonment.

J	Bernards, N				Bernards, Nick			The World Bank, Agricultural Credit, and the Rise of Neoliberalism in Global Development	NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY			English	Article						World Bank; agriculture; finance; neoliberalism; marketisation; development	GEOGRAPHIES; CRISIS	This article examines the development of the World Bank's agricultural credit programming between 1960 and 1990. I show how these projects constituted key sites where neoliberal development governance was initially articulated, negotiated, and contested. Agricultural credit was a key point of emphasis for the Bank during its 'Assault on Poverty' era in the 1970s. Agricultural programming in this era reflected a strong emphasis on agricultural development through marketisation and commercialisation, yet also very clearly demonstrated clear points of ambivalence around the role of credit in relation to agricultural markets. Agricultural credit projects increasingly included implicit or explicit conditionalities linked to the marketisation of interest rates, the commercialisation of state-owned agricultural lenders, and the marketisation of wider financial sectors into the 1980s. But these efforts to marketize and commercialise agricultural credit through these projects often reflected mundane operational challenges as much as ideological shifts, and themselves largely failed even on their own terms. Looking at the evolution of agricultural credit projects thus shows how broadly neoliberal positions were arrived at in part through trial and error adjustments to operational concerns, as well as how fraught the promotion of market-based financial systems was in practice even in the structural adjustment era.

Transparency is deemed vital in the creation of sustainable and resilient supply chains and overall effective corporate governance. There are two distinct orientations toward the use of technology by multinational corporations (MNCs) in creating sustainability transparency within their global supply chains: control and relational. A control orientation views technology as a tool to gather the ever-increasing levels of sustainability data on supplier practices in an efficient, secure, and progressively automated manner. A relational orientation adopts a view where technology is a tool to help build social relations and improve dialogue and collaboration on sustainability throughout the supply chain. A key difference in the two orientations lies in the mindset of the MNC manager toward the development of supply chain sustainability transparency. The article illustrates the effective application of both approaches and offers advice to managers on the design choices they need to consider in choosing technologies.

J	van den Brandeler, F; Gupta, J; Hordijk, M				van den Brandeler, Francine; Gupta, Joyeeta; Hordijk, Michaela			Megacities and rivers: Scalar mismatches between urban water management and river basin management	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Urban water governance; Metropolitan areas; River basin management; Scalar mismatch	RESOURCES MANAGEMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FRESH-WATER; GOVERNANCE; SUSTAINABILITY; MEXICO; TRANSITIONS; SYSTEM; IMPACT; REUSE	Due to rapid urbanization, population growth and economic drivers, megacities and metropolises around the world face increasing water challenges, such as water scarcity, degradation of water resources and water-related risks such as flooding. Climate change is expected to put additional stress on already strained metropolitan water management systems. Although there is considerable research on river basin management and on urban water management, there is hardly any on metropolitan water management. Similarly, as urban water generally emerges from and returns to river basins, it is surprising how little literature there is that explicitly connects these two spheres of governance. Hence this review paper addresses the: What does a review of the literature tell us about the overlap and reconciliation between the concepts of Integrated Water Resources/River Basin Management and Metropolitan/Urban Water Management, particularly in relation to megacities? Based on an extensive literature review, this paper concludes that the key differences between the two are in relation to their overarching framework, scope, inputs and outputs of water and in relation to dealing with extreme weather events. The literature review reveals how sustainable and integrated urban water management increasingly adopt principles and rhetoric from integrated water resource management, this has yet to translate into significant changing practices on the ground. Urban water management still often occurs independently of river basin issues. Achieving coherence between river basin management and sustainable/integrated urban water management is even more difficult in metropolises and megacities, because the latter consists of multiple political-administrative units. The article concludes that the scalar mismatch between river basin management and metropolitan/megacity water governance deserves much greater attention than it currently receives in the academic and policy debates.

J	Sunikka-Blank, M; Kiyono, Y				Sunikka-Blank, Minna; Kiyono, Yumi			Why do you need more towers? Four approaches to sustainable urban regeneration in Japan	ARQ-ARCHITECTURAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY			English	Article								The article explores the interpretation of sustainability from the Japanese perspective. Drawing from four case studies, the article asks: how is sustainability interpreted in the context of urban regeneration in Japan? Two case studies (Musashi Kosugi and Kashiwanoha) are high-rise, high-density developments that use new building technology but have little or no attention to the context. UR Yokodai danchi renovation and Kamakura 'regional capitalism' are community-led projects that preserve the existing buildings and the local community. These four developments are analysed in relation to sustainability criteria that includes socioeconomic targets and conservation of the townscape. The findings suggest that although Musashi Kosugi and Kashiwanoha are prime examples of urban densification and the use of smart technology, challenges posed by the post-population peak society, oversupply of housing, and consequences of the pandemic question the flexibility and sustainability of these developments. Yokodai danchi demonstrates the potential of postwar housing stock to accommodate sustainable renovation and provide affordable housing. Kamakura 'regional capitalism', rooted in joint venture between the local governance, entrepreneurs, and old residents, middle-density and mixed-use urban fabric, can develop into flexible, idiosyncratic, and family-friendly environments. The research suggests that the Japanese government's new policies such as Super Cities Program should not restrict the vision of sustainable cities to new build developments and that urban densification should not always be taken as a synonym to sustainable city developments.

J	Maconachie, R; Fortin, E				Maconachie, Roy; Fortin, Elizabeth			'New agriculture' for sustainable development? Biofuels and agrarian change in post-war Sierra Leone	JOURNAL OF MODERN AFRICAN STUDIES			English	Article							CORPORATE-SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; POLITICAL-ECONOMY; EXPERIENCES; PROJECTS; FOOD	In sub-Saharan Africa, commercial bioenergy production has been hailed as a new form of 'green capitalism' that will deliver 'win-win' outcomes and 'pro poor' development. Yet in an era of global economic recession and soaring food prices, biofuel 'sustainability' has been at the centre of controversy. This paper focuses on the case of post-war Sierra Leone, a country that has over the last decade been consistently ranked as one of the poorest in the world, facing food insecurity, high unemployment and entrenched poverty. Following a recent government strategy to secure foreign direct investment in biofuels production in agriculturally rich regions of the country, the largest foreign investment in Sierra Leone since the end of its civil war has been secured: a Swiss company is to invest US$368 million into a large-scale biofuels project over the course of 3 years, and promises to simultaneously stimulate an enabling environment for investment, provide job opportunities for youth and increase food production. For multiple actors involved in the project, the concept of 'sustainability' is crucial but accordingly there are varying interpretations of its meaning. Such differences in interpretation and the complex contradictions within discourses of sustainability are in turn framed by the various scales within which these actors are situated. While attempts have been made to manage these contradictions through global sustainability standards, the unequal power relations between different actors will ultimately determine the ways in which they are likely to be resolved. The paper concludes by reflecting on how these processes may be contributing to a changing governance landscape and wider global political economy within which bioenergy is being produced, processed and consumed.

Drawing on new strands of research in business ethics, we employ an ordonomic' perspective and proceed in four steps. First, we sketch how sustainability semantics has evolved historically from a societal searchlight to a heuristics for business practice. Second, we discuss how business firms can make strategic use of moral commitments as governance contributions by deploying individual or collective self-commitments as well as commitment services in their stakeholder relations. Third, we combine these four governance strategies with the three ESG (ecological, social and governance') criteria of sustainability. We derive and illustrate with real-life examples a 12-box matrix as a tool for the strategic management of corporate sustainability. Fourth, we discuss the specific contribution of our ordonomic approach to the literature.

The EU's environmental acquis gave ENGOs new and often forceful tools to reach their aims by emphasising the importance of collaborative relations between state and non-state actors and by offering opportunities to civil society actors to circumvent their national governments in the policy process. Implementation of the EU's Natura 2000 network in Hungary, Poland and Romania further reinforced endogenously driven professionalisation and institutionalisation of civil society groups. While EU accession benefited from the expertise of professional ENGOs, the logic of the accession process together with the weakness of both state actors and civil society has not led to the development of sustainable cooperative state-society relations in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE).

J	Tregidga, H				Tregidga, Helen			Biodiversity offsetting: problematisation of an emerging governance regime	ACCOUNTING AUDITING & ACCOUNTABILITY JOURNAL			English	Article						Biodiversity offsetting; Accounting for biodiversity; Governmentality; Problematization; Sustainable development; Conservation	SUSTAINABILITY	Purpose - The paper aims to analyse accounting rationalities and practices which lie behind biodiversity offsetting. The way in which accounting functions as a technology of government through the practice of biodiversity offsetting is to be considered and its effects examined. Design/methodology/approach - Governmentality is drawn upon to examine ways in which power and authority are exercised in a single case study setting. Data analysed comprise corporate and industry websites and documents, corporate reports, public documentation and interviews. The arena concept is utilised to highlight contestation in the case, and signal concerns regarding the wider impact of the use of particular accounting rationalities and technologies in the context of biodiversity offsetting. Findings - The paper provides empirical insights into how accounting for biodiversity offsetting rationales and practices constitute an attempt to reproduce power relations in favour of particular parties and foster disciplinary effects. The practice of biodiversity offsetting is problematised through critiquing accounting's governing role in the areas of biodiversity quantification and biodiversity trading. Questions are raised as to whether biodiversity offsetting enabled by accounting techniques is leading to greater accountability and ultimately protection of biodiversity, or whether it represents a mechanism through which particular species and habitat destruction can be justified, or at least hidden in its accounting. Originality/value - While biodiversity offsetting research is not uncommon within science and law, the analysis of how accounting functions as a technology of government within biodiversity offsetting is believed to be unique.

Innovation is being progressively applied to examining the organization of joint technological, social, and institutional modernizations in the primary sector. Exploring the governance of actor relations, potential policies, and support structures is crucial in the phase of innovation, e.g., during research activities, often applied at the national or sectorial scale. However, when opposing normative guidelines for alternative systems of agriculture arise (e.g., the industrial agriculture paradigm), modernizations in agricultural and forestry may contribute to outlining more sustainable systems. To date, innovations in the primary sector do not seem as advanced as in other sectors, apart from industrial agriculture, which sometimes appears to be the most encouraged. The present review aims to shed light on innovations that have been identified and promoted in recent years in the primary sector, including agriculture and forestry. The need to pursue sustainable development in this sector requires the inclusion of a fourth dimension, namely energy. In fact, energy sustainability is an issue that has been much discussed in recent years. However, the need for progressive technological progress is indispensable to ensure long-lasting energy efficiency. The aim is to understand what innovations have been implemented recently, highlighting opportunities and limitations for the primary sector.

J	Antonova, AS				Antonova, Anna S.			The rhetoric of "responsible fishing": Notions of human rights and sustainability in the European Union's bilateral fishing agreements with developing states	MARINE POLICY			English	Article						Fisheries; European Union; Common Fisheries Policy; Normative power; Sustainable development; Human rights	WEST-AFRICA; FISHERIES	Over the past two decades, European Union rhetoric has communicated a desire to take on a normative power role in advancing human rights and sustainable development approaches in the context of global fisheries policy. Officials have propagated an image of a "new Europe," committed to promoting good maritime governance and ensuring responsible fishing worldwide as part of its global responsibility to human rights and sustainable development. These normative principles have at times been framed as an integral part of the European Union's legal and political identity. In practice, however, the European Union's bilateral fishing agreements with developing states have come short of European Union aspirations, facing criticism for hindering rather than aiding local development. This paper explores the bilateral agreements from an international law perspective, engaging in grounded theory, discourse analysis, and a detailed case study on European Union-Senegal fishing relations. For the European Union, the article raises questions about conflicts between national and supranational fishing goals and about the challenges these conflicts present to its goal of normative leadership. More generally, the study suggests implications for enacting international law principles on the ground, as well as for the inherent power dynamics of post-colonial relations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Yu, C; de Jong, M; Cheng, BD				Yu, Chang; de Jong, Martin; Cheng, Baodong			Getting depleted resource-based cities back on their feet again the example of Yichun in China	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Sustainable development; Resource-based city; Forestry city; Eco-efficiency; China	SUSTAINABLE CONSUMPTION; ECO-EFFICIENCY; GOVERNANCE; PROVINCE; ISSUE; CITY; TOWN	Sustainable consumption and production (or lack thereof) can leave very distinct marks at the city level. Among the cities aiming at sustainable development, resource-based cities (RBCs) are of special concern due to the tight interrelations economy, urban development, natural resources and environmental context have in them. Excessive exploitation and inefficient resource utilization often cause pollution and ecological risks. As natural resources are getting exhausted, their resource-based industries will collapse, threaten wider urban development and lead to economic recession. In this article, we focus on the economic and ecological dilemmas that the RBCs face in China. We first present an overview of China's policy implementation for rescuing and transforming RBCs. Then a particular RBC, Yichun, which is classified as "recessionary", is analyzed to understand the challenges that it faces during its transition. The method of eco-efficiency is used to uncover Yichun's environmental performance in relation to its economic development. Subsequently, we explore the barriers in terms of industrial transformation, conflicts between national, provincial and local governmental actions, and the effects of the circular economy in Yichun. At the end of this article, we formulate several recommendations to facilitate Yichun's sustainable development. We propose that Yichun specifically needs to consider the energy consumption and pollution when selecting alternative industries. Furthermore, one-size-fits-all policies do not help to solve the problems in Yichun. Policies need to be contextualized locally through well reflected coordination between higher and lower tiers of government. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	John, R; Jaeger-Erben, M; Ruckert-John, J				John, Rene; Jaeger-Erben, Melanie; Rueckert-John, Jana			Elusive Practices: Considerations on limits and possibilities of environmental policy for sustainable consumption	ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND GOVERNANCE			English	Article						German environmental policy; sustainable consumption; social practices; everyday life; environmental consciousness survey		The Earth Summit on Sustainable Development in 1992 brought about a fundamental shift in the mandate of environmental policy. How to protect the environment and nature from citizens was no longer the main issue. Rather, the focus was how to organize majorities among citizens for a collective effort on a societal transformation towards sustainability. The environmental effects of citizens' everyday routines of consumption came into focus and ways of influencing them were sought. In this paper, one of the strategies German environmental policy employs for observing the everyday consumption of citizens is analyzed. How this approach has evolved during the last decades will be shown, as well as shortcomings of the current approach. Drawing on considerations from theories of social practice, three kinds of reason for these shortcomings are discussed. The first one lies in an ambivalent (or paradoxical) relation of environmental policy-makers to consumers' rationality'. The second reason is related to the first and refers to the different horizons of consumers' everyday practices and practices of environmental policy. The third reason is rooted in the excessive and unrealistic demand on environmental policy that accompanies the sustainability mandate. The paper concludes by suggesting a social innovation-oriented policy as a way of connecting political goals to actual changes in consumption practices.

Climate change is an increasingly complex challenge for these territories. Tackling climate change, moreover, in a sustainable way, is a priority in the European Union, which has set several ambitious short- and long-term mitigation, adaptation, and sustainability targets. It is a central issue of how society can respond to the climate emergency that is affected by and depends on the vertical and horizontal interrelations among different stakeholders, organizations, governance actors, etc., and their activities. Countries, regions, counties, and cities around the world react by developing climate strategies. The operationalization of the high-level political agreements and discourses is uncertain, and the policies in practice should also be evaluated on regional and city levels, just as the milestones of related strategic planning processes fostering local adaptive capacity. According to regional and urban governance, it is pivotal addressing not only mitigation but adaptation issues to be able to foster sustainable regional development, also considering the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) specified in the Agenda 2030. Adaptation to climate change is increasingly becoming a priority for policy action. It also has high relevance to find the synergic interrelations towards an adaptive future. This paper evaluates the recent changes in Hungarian regional and urban planning in relation to climate policy approach and reports a state of adaptation oriented spatial planning on NUTS-3 (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) and LAU-1 (Local Administrative Units) levels. The results are based on the collection of all relevant climate change-related strategic documents on these levels in Hungary and on the analysis of specific information. There is a lack of knowledge related to the comprehensive adaptation policy and planning on regional and local levels in Hungary. The results of the evaluation show the state-of-art knowledge related to possible adaptation pathways and the various engagement level for climate policy approach on different spatial levels in Hungary. In the case of the examined research area, the development of more mitigation oriented planning documents and low level of adaptation measures and monitoring process management tools is seen as critical.

Yet, empirical evidence on the nature and scope of the effects, in particular on the poorest and most vulnerable, is scant. This article makes both a theoretical and empirical contribution by analyzing the complex effects and risks of social protection policies in Ghana and Kenya. It proposes a comprehensive inclusive development framework for analyzing social protection impacts. Based on a two-years study on the multidimensional wellbeing effects in rural communities in both countries, it is found that social protection impacts food, education, health and to a limited extent productivity levels of individuals and households, their family and community relations and social equity, as well as perceptions of self-reliance and citizenship.

J	Jiang, Y; Zevenbergen, C; Ma, YC				Jiang, Yong; Zevenbergen, Chris; Ma, Yongchi			Urban pluvial flooding and stormwater management: A contemporary review of China's challenges and "sponge cities" strategy	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Review						Urban pluvial flooding; China; Stormwater management; Urban planning; Governance; Low impact development	LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT; YANGTZE-RIVER DELTA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER MANAGEMENT; EXTREME PRECIPITATION; URBANIZATION; ADAPTATION; DRAINAGE; GOVERNANCE; DESIGN	In recent years, urban pluvial flooding caused by extreme rainfall has increasingly occurred across China. This paper reviews the challenges faced by China in addressing urban pluvial flooding and managing urban storm water, with a particular focus on a policy initiative termed sponge cities. The paper first synthetically presents pluvial flood disasters in urbanized areas, and analyses their causes and formation mechanisms. It then introduces China's sponge cities initiative and discusses policy implementation in relation to contemporary understanding of sustainable urban stormwater management and international experience with innovative practices. The initiative, while theoretically well grounded and appropriate by its design principles, is shown subject to diverse implementation challenges, ranging from technological complexity to limited or lack of governance capacity as reflected in management ideology, knowledge and capacity of learning, participatory and integrated governance, investment financing, implementation pathway, planning and organization, and project evaluation. The paper offers some strategies for addressing those challenges, which include: 1) continuous experiment-based deep learning through pilot and institutionalization of knowledge and information management with city-to-city peering learning mechanisms, 2) establishment of institutional mechanisms dedicated to participatory, coordinated and integrated governance of the policy initiative, 3) increased government role in creating favorable conditions for investments, and 4) appropriate plafining and an adaptive approach to policy implementation. The paper concludes that the sponge cities initiative can be an effective approach only if China commits to appropriate technical, governance, financial, and organizational measures to effectively address the challenges for policy implementation.

J	Gustafsson, S; Mignon, I				Gustafsson, Sara; Mignon, Ingrid			Municipalities as intermediaries for the design and local implementation of climate visions	EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES			English	Article						Municipalities; intermediation strategies; sustainable society; climate visions; management approach	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY; MULTILEVEL GOVERNANCE; CITIES; TRANSITIONS; STRATEGIES; NETWORKS; PARTICIPATION; ORGANIZATION; GOVERNMENT; SYSTEMS	The transition to a sustainable society requires the development of visions paving the way for socio-technical changes. In recent years, the literature on sustainable transitions and urban planning has highlighted the intermediation role of municipalities to implement international and national goals and visions at a local level. Yet, empirical research studying municipalities from the lens of the intermediation theory are sparse. This paper aims at contributing to a better understanding of what strategies municipalities use when intermediating between and within different scales of governance (i.e. local, national and international), and what factors influence the choice of strategies. Through semi-structured interviews and document studies, three Swedish municipalities are studied. Results show that these municipalities translate the visions through local experiments, task delegation and coalitions. Additionally, the analysis indicates that the local circumstances, rather than the relations between the local level and the higher levels of governance or the guidance of national policies, influence the choice of intermediation strategy. Particularly, whether the management approach is centralized or decentralized, result- or process-oriented, participative or exclusive, is determinant. Results also indicate that municipalities perform both top-down and bottom-up intermediation, i.e. closing the loop from the local to the national and/or international levels.

TRANSPORT POLICY			English	Article						Sustainable infrastructure planning; Fragmentation, Implementation gap; Programme-oriented planning approach	WATER-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; TRANSPORT POLICY; GOVERNANCE; TRANSFORMATION; INTEGRATION; MOBILITY; CITIES	Road infrastructure planning is undergoing major changes. Infrastructure development is increasingly considered in relation to environmental degradation, climatic impacts and societal trends. Reinforced by the notion of sustainable development, infrastructure planning is increasingly focused on the realization of integrated planning goals. In planning practice, however, the transport infrastructure policy silo is strongly sectoral in nature, which can result in efforts fragmented along sectoral lines to realize integrated goals. As a result, a gap can be found between the formulation and implementation of these goals. Meanwhile, historical shifts in infrastructure policy and planning reveal that earlier planning approaches have been adopted in response to these issues. A project-oriented planning approach seems to have developed in response to the implementation gap, while an integrated planning approach is focused on solving fragmentation. In this article we aim to explore and conceptualize these policy shifts in transport policy and planning and investigate what lessons can be drawn from these approaches to dealing with these issues in today's road infrastructure planning. We find that the current programme-oriented planning approach is focused on combining the strengths of both historical approaches. It aims at putting the focus on an integrated planning approach, while contextualizing projects in a project-oriented planning approach. As such, the emerging programmatic planning approach provides an interesting avenue for further research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The crucial question remains how countries can enhance trade amid these differences. In this article, we measure the degree to which governance and institutions differ between countries as "governance distance." Using a sample of EU/EFTA imports, we examine how adopting private agrifood safety standards modify the effect of governance distance on exports of fruits and vegetables, in particular apples, bananas, and grapes, within a structural gravity framework. Our results show that while increasing governance distance hinders bilateral trade, the interaction of standards and the governance distance is positively associated with exports, hence partially offsetting the direct trade-inhibiting effects of the latter. GlobalGAP certified countries see the trade-inhibiting effects of governance distance on their exports reduced by about 50%, ceteris paribus.

However, unsustainable forest management based on 'wood mining' reduces this potential. Based on document analysis, participant observations and interviews, this article shows how non-state actors-environmental NGOs and forest companies-address forest resource depletion and primary forest loss in Russia. We analyse two key interrelated forest discourses driven by non-state actors in Russia: (1) intensive forest management in secondary forests as a pathway towards sustained yield and primary forest conservation; (2) intact forest landscapes as a priority in primary forest conservation. We illustrate how these discourses have been integrated into policy debates, institutions and practices and discuss their relation to relevant global discourses. The article concludes that despite successful cases in conserving intact forest landscapes, there is still a frontier between sustainable forest management discourses and forestry practice in Russia.

This study shows the development of a model, which explains the relation between built environment design and social sustainability in urban renewal. To do so, firstly, a comprehensive literature review was conducted, after which a pilot study was administered. This led to the identification of 32 built environment design elements. Their contributions to social sustainability were evaluated utilizing a survey among 323 people who previously worked in urban renewal projects. The design elements were grouped by exploratory factor analysis under five factors, and these factors were named as, accessibility and quality of social life, conservation of resources, quality of the built environment, protection of disadvantaged groups, and commercial and economic opportunities. Then, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was carried out with 60 academics and practitioners to identify the weights of the factors. Accessibility and quality of social life factor reached the highest weight with 33 %, while the other four factors shared close weights. The model obtained as a result of this study will increase the awareness of urban renewal stakeholders about social sustainability, by demonstrating clearly which design elements should be considered to improve the social sustainability of urban renewal projects.

Similarly, Digital Earth undergoes a paradigm shift to an open platform that actively supports user engagement. While the public becomes able to contribute new content, we recognize a gap in user-driven validation, feedback and requirements capture, and innovative application development. Rather than defining Digital Earth applications top down, we see a need for methods and tools that will help building applications bottom up and driven by community needs. These should include a technology toolbox of geospatial and environmental enablers, which allow to access functional building blocks and content in multiple ways, but - equally important - enable the collaboration within partially unknown stakeholder networks. The validation and testing in real-life scenarios will be a central requirement when approaching the Digital Earth 2020 goals, which were articulated recently. We particularly argue to follow a Living Lab approach for co-creation and awareness rising in relation to environmental and geospatial matters. We explain why and how such a Digital Earth Living Lab could lead to a sustainable approach for developing, deploying, and using Digital Earth applications and suggest a paradigm shift for Virtual Globes becoming forums for research and innovation.

It aims to outline the ways in which the prosaic state can, through everyday tasks, decisions, measurements and demonstration requirements, force a calculative logic onto and into community based movements and groups in ways that can be counterproductive. It centrally argues that the will to quantify, in particular the accompanying demonstration requirements (most often a number), enacts three fundamental shifts in the collective subjectivity integral to community groups and movements. First, the preferred form of knowledge becomes abstract, disembodied and fungible (episteme) over and against relational ways to understand and conceive togetherness (metis), including ecological relationships. Second, the vision of community shifts from a search to belong, an intrinsic end in itself, towards an instrumental means to achieve specific targets. Finally, third, the splitting of means from ends. These can all be traced from the demonstration requirements, and numbers, accompanying neoliberal prosaic state engagement with community groups.

The dilemmas of rural complex ecosystems are the cumulative results of historical material and energy exchange between humans and nature in the social-ecological dimension. A tool for evaluating sustainability, emergy theory, measures different resource flow qualities. To conserve healthy rural ecosystems, dynamic equilibrium with a coupled interrelation of social development and energy operation must be maintained within system carrying capacities. This raises the question that current emergy studies ignored of how to explore reference indicators for technical solutions and the roots of sustainability change for rural governance systems under social development. This paper proposes a diachronic emergy approach that integrates emergy evaluation into an environmental history research framework with social development models and social-ecological factors to realize system wellbeing. Considering the village of Hekeng, China, emergy accounting was performed for three typical years (1953, 1990 and 2015) combined with social development models (traditional agriculture, chemical-assisted agriculture and commercial tourism periods). Based on the benchmark year 1953, a diachronic analysis of changes in emergy indicators reconstructed in a social-ecological context and corresponding social-ecological factors was conducted. The results show that the EYR and ELR of 3.16 and 0.53, respectively, for 1953 can be employed as reference indicators of resource utilization in the sustainable development of Hekeng. The potential impacts of resource use changes on the system's well-being were explored, and the findings indicate that technical solutions must be integrated with a governance system based on production relations, forest environments and community culture. Recommendations for sustainable development of ecological agricultural techniques, ecotourism modes, and governance with social-ecological integration are proposed. The diachronic emergy approach provides a new perspective for the implementation of technical solutions in human society and the formation of sustainability strategies for system well-being.

Large-scale land acquisitions and institutions: Patterns, influence and barriers in Zambia	GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						governance; institutions; land-grabbing; large-scale land acquisition; sub-Saharan Africa; Zambia	AFRICA; APPROPRIATION; INVESTMENTS; RESISTANCE; GEOGRAPHY; FOREST; ACCESS	Large-scale land acquisitions (LaSLAs) have been a common feature of neoliberal transformation in which state entities facilitate foreign investments; yet the related governance dynamics remain poorly understood. This paper combines policy analysis and interview data to investigate governance dynamics of LaSLAs and analyses competing authority and power relations among national actors mediating land access for the case of Zambia. Our findings show that corporate interests, donor and regional support drive LaSLAs, but national factors predominate. While possibilities for LaSLAs are created by state institutions, the state agencies seeking to administer land-based resources also limit their potential through competing authority and agendas. The demand for land and water, accompanied by government and donor resources, heightens tensions among state entities over decision-making and creation of new frontiers of resource control. By focusing on state and non-state actors and their articulation in LaSLAs, our study shows that the top-down nature of governance of land, labour and water resources is problematic for long-term sustainable agriculture and rural development. The paper highlights the importance of state entities and their control, legal extensions and governance practices in relation to local subjects in delivering LaSLAs and facilitating the emergence of a more locally rooted agro-vision for agriculture for sustainable and socially just rural development.

Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues are therefore gaining increasing importance, in line with the growing demand for corporate sustainability. ESG ratings foster the comparison of companies with respect to their sustainable practices. This study aims to investigate how ESG ratings impact financial performance in the European food industry. Ordinary least squares regression is applied to analyze the relation between ESG ratings and financial performance over a 4-year period from 2017 to 2020. The profitability measures Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE) are employed as financial performance measures, while ESG ratings are obtained from the database CSRHub. Results show that higher ESG ratings are associated with better financial performance. Although the effect is modest in the present study, the findings support previous results that ESG ratings are positively related to financial performance. Nonetheless, they also highlight that ESG ratings strongly converge to the mean, which depicts the need to reassess whether ESG ratings are able to measure actual ESG behavior.

In recent decades, theories of transitions have been introduced, which include the multi-level approach indicating ways to govern transitions through understanding the interactions between niches, regimes and landscapes. An alternative approach is suggested, which takes its outset in arenas of development and increased awareness of actors and their way of interpreting context and performing interventions. Building on three cases covering aspects of transitions since the 1970s, the article compares the two approaches based on three concerns in relation to transition studies. The first concern reflects that conflicts are important elements of change helping actors to navigate. The second concern builds on the observation that actors engage at all levels in society including visions, institutions, and innovations. The third concern addresses the role of academic theories and advice regarding governance of transition processes in which they function as entrenched actors. The article ends by emphasising the need to help actors navigate in a field in flux. The study of arenas of development may help interpret transitions in the making, and provide a background of information about how different actors can navigate and perform strategic interventions that support sustainable transitions.

It argues that an adequate account of these relations must recognize their inherent spatio-temporality and, hence, their space-time dynamics. This is not an optional extra but a definite descriptive and explanatory requirement. Moreover, while structure is recognized as a product of path-dependent institutionalization and path-shaping (collective) agency, agency is seen in turn as discursively and materially reproduced and transformed. This approach treats structure in terms of a differential spatio-temporal configuration of constraints and opportunities, reference to which informs the empirical analysis of strategic agency within the overall agency, structure, institutions, discourse (ASID) heuristic. The paper concludes with an eightfold typology of particular combinations of ASID features to guide analyses of socio-economic development in all its (dis-) junctural complexity.

Towards a Sustainable Landscape: Constructing Identities and Ambitions in a Citizen Initiative in the Making	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						citizen initiative; identities; ambitions; interactional framing; discursive construction; positioning; self-organisation; sustainable landscape; landscape transition; case study	SELF-GOVERNANCE; ACTIVE CITIZENSHIP; URBAN-DEVELOPMENT; POLICY; ORGANIZATIONS; VALUES; TALK	The recent proliferation of citizen initiatives that aim to contribute to sustainable landscape transition prompted us to study how members of such an initiative in-the-making try to position themselves in their environment in order to make a meaningful contribution. We use a single case study in the east of the Netherlands to study how members discursively construct identities and ambitions through the inclusion of people and ideas over time. We applied an interactional framing analysis to 20 audio-recorded and transcribed meetings of the citizen initiative. The results show that various actors and ideas were included over time, resulting in the construction of different ambitions and identities over time. Ambitions changed in response to new event and changing circumstances. To justify these changing ambitions, the members constructed new identities during their conversations, using different interactional framing strategies. The study reveals that the process of finding an ambition and identity continuously changed direction, paradoxically, due to a lack of direction that hindered the members in making coherent and sustainable decisions. We conclude that a citizen initiative should actively interact with their relation groups to find a direction that supports the process of effectively positioning their initiative and contributes to the shared goal of improving the quality of the living environment.

The inclusion, exclusion and distribution effects of IBMs must be better understood, however, in order to make them more impactful. This study, which was carried out in three districts in northern Ethiopia, employed a mixed methods approach. Our results show that inclusion and exclusion are both complex and multidimensional. A focus on transaction costs, productive resource endowments and chain governance is crucial for enhancing smallholders' inclusion. Our results further indicate that income obtained from participation in IBMs is unequally distributed. The benefits of IBMs vary according to the underlying position of the smallholder. Hence, inclusive development interventions should acknowledge the various positions of smallholders and consider how their positions shape social relations locally. The paper thus reveals the various dimensions, contradictory tendencies, hidden costs and side effects of IBMs.	[Gebru, Kebede Manjur] Mekelle Univ, Dept Rural Dev & Agr Extens, POB 231, Mekelle, Ethiopia; [Rammelt, Crelis; Leung, Maggi] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Social Sci Res, Dept Geog Planning & Int Dev Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands	Mekelle University; University of Amsterdam	Rammelt, C (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Social Sci Res, Dept Geog Planning & Int Dev Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands.	solomonmanjur@gmail.com; C.F.Rammelt@uva.nl; w.h.m.leung@uva.nl			Ministry of Foreign Affairs through NWO-WOTRO	Ministry of Foreign Affairs through NWO-WOTRO	This study is part of the research agenda of the Knowledge Platform on Inclusive Development Policies and funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs through NWO-WOTRO.		30	0	0	0	0	PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD	BASINGSTOKE	BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND	0957-8811	1743-9728		EUR J DEV RES	Eur.

Forestry Decentralization in the Context of Global Carbon Priorities: New Challenges for Subnational Governments	FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE			English	Article						decentralization; forestry; carbon forestry; governance; land use change	REDD PLUS; POLYCENTRIC GOVERNANCE; REDUCE DEFORESTATION; CENTRAL KALIMANTAN; PUBLIC-AUTHORITY; LAND-USE; INDONESIA; ELITE; RECONFIGURATION; PERSISTENCE	The recent emphasis on the role of tropical forests in facing climate change has made forest decentralization debates more relevant than ever. Discussions on multilevel governance, polycentricity, and nested approaches to governance surround the central question, ever more pertinent considering global environmental change, of who holds the mandate over forests. Different levels of government, as well as private and civil society actors (companies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), indigenous peoples, and local communities), compete over the rights of ownership, administration, and management of forest landscapes-decisions with a crucial impact on land use, land use change and the future of forests. Understanding the relations among different levels of governance, and government specifically, is essential to understand how carbon forestry has engaged with decentralization and the role of subnational governments (SNGs) in developing practical land use solutions. We draw on current trends in the forestry decentralization literature to ask: (i) has carbon forestry opened new opportunities for SNGs to support the sustainable governance of forest landscapes? (ii) have meaningful powers been assigned to SNGs in support of democratic processes of decision-making over forest landscapes? and (iii) is carbon forestry influencing the relationships between levels of government in a way that challenges unequal power relations? By examining carbon forestry projects and forestry decentralization processes across five countries (Indonesia, Mexico, Peru, Tanzania and Vietnam) with carbon forestry initiatives, we demonstrate how the role of SNGs is circumscribed by existing forestry decentralization trends. Decentralization initiatives in recent decades have provided SNGs with new mandates to manage forests, but new attributions do not always imply meaningful powers. The implementation of carbon forestry projects is molded by pre-existing power relations that shape the impacts of forestry decentralization on livelihoods and forest ecosystems. We find that carbon forestry, with both centralizing and decentralizing tendencies, operates within the spaces left by existing power dynamics that mold the way transfers of power are put into practice. Jurisdictional approaches will need to negotiate with this context to be able to push forward sustainable pathways.

However, huge coal consumption produced a large amount of carbon dioxide and aggravated ecological problems. Thus, this study uses energy consumption, GDP, and the urbanization rate from 1981 to 2020 via the Vector Auto Regressive (VAR) and impulse response function to analyze the interaction among carbon emissions, urbanization, and economic growth in Shanxi Province. The results show that relations among carbon emissions, economic growth, and urbanization are complicated, and all three have a long-term stable equilibrium relationship. The lag effect on each other reacts violently in the short term, and gradually becomes gentle over time. In the short term, carbon emissions are positively correlated with economic growth and have the same trend of change, but in the long run, carbon emissions will have a small hindering effect on economic growth. Carbon emissions reduce urbanization levels in the short term, and then gradually climb, tending to stabilize as time goes by. With respect to receiving economic growth impaction, carbon emission increases at the initial stage of economic development, but the growth rate becomes slow as time goes by. With respect to receiving urbanization impaction, carbon emission first declines and then rises slowly with relatively small and slow growth in general. The relations among carbon emissions, economic growth, and urbanization are complicated. Therefore, local government needs to be very cautious in regional governance, especially in economic and urban planning and design, take various factors into consideration, and adhere to low-carbon, green, and circular development so as to achieve the carbon peak and carbon neutrality as scheduled and make the urban economy develop sustainably.

Innovation and the commons: lessons from the governance of genetic resources in potato breeding	AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES			English	Article						Commons; Innovation; Genetic resources; Potato; Hybrid breeding; Co-production	TECHNOLOGY-DEPENDENT COMMONS; LATE BLIGHT; PLANT; EXPECTATIONS; AGRICULTURE; SOCIOLOGY; FARMERS; SCIENCE; RIGHTS; CROPS	This article explores the relation between innovation and resources that are governed as commons by looking at the governance of potato genetic resources, especially in the context of the emergence ofhybrid diploid potato breedingthat will enable potato propagation through true seeds. As a new breeding tool, hybrid diploid potato breeding may not only revolutionize traditional potato breeding practices, it may also strongly affect current governance modes of potato genetic resources as a commons. Contrary to conventional accounts of the commons that treat technological innovation mainly as an exogenous factor, we argue that technological innovation can better be understood as an endogenous factor. In particular, we develop aco-production frameworkof innovation and the commons that draws attention to the different ways in which innovation, commons and its governance interact. Using this framework, we demonstrate that the constitution of potato genetic resources as a commons cannot be understood without considering the various ways in which technological innovation affects resources and mediate how these are governed. While reversely, technological innovations themselves are also enabled and constrained by users who govern potato genetic resources as a shared resource.

The Case of the Romanian Capital Market	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						sustainable company growth; accounting information quality; discretionary accruals; investment performance; Romanian capital market	EARNINGS MANAGEMENT; CORPORATE GOVERNANCE; INFORMATION QUALITY; ACCRUALS; IRRATIONALITY; MANIPULATION; FIRMS; IFRS	The paper analyzes the influence of sustainable growth (SGR) as a reflection of the manner of strategic business organization, particularly in the quality of reported financial information (magnitude of discretionary accruals-DAC) as an expression of the ethical attitude adopted by companies in the entity-investor relationship, on the investors' decisions, substantiated in the performance level of the shares held. Using models consecrated in the literature, the results reflect a significant influence, both in the case of separate testing of the two factors (SGR and DAC), and in the case of the conjugated action thereof, on investment performance. The relations were also tested by introducing certain control variables into the analysis, such as: the intangible ratio, quick ratio, company size, as well as the SGR sensitivity function of the level of information quality. In the case of financial information quality, specific indicators from the two consecrated value relevance testing models by Ohlson (1995) and Easton and Harris (1991) were used as control variables. The obtained results are robust, preserving the sense and intensity of the influences. However, in the case of testing for the influence of information quality on share price, it was noticed an insignificant relation, associated with the situation in which, to execute some speculative transactions, investors particularly interpreted conjunctural factors. The study contributes to the development of the specialty literature by highlighting the role of internal growth and information quality as determinant factors in the investors' analyses, while also offering a potentially practical tool for assessing the opportunity of making placements in the capital of companies.

Though not designed to replace negotiated or binding outcomes, voluntary commitments can offer a critical tool in currently ungoverned or under-governed systems. The Blue Economy is an example of a rapidly evolving agenda where formal governance arrangements are at best nascent, in part due to the trans-border nature of issues and prominent involvement of multiple types of actors. As such voluntary commitments provide an important mechanism through which to monitor the evolution of the concept and identify gaps or shortfalls in its implementation. Our analysis of global voluntary commitments on the Blue Economy made to recent high-profile ocean futures meetings, found a trend towards capacity development, research, and investment in emerging and larger scale sectors such as offshore aquaculture and renewable energy. A concurrent focus was on securitizing, regulating or diverting effort from historically significant fisheries sectors. European organizations are playing a dominant role in Blue Economy commitments, with a notable absence of commitments from major Blue Economy powers such as China and India. We identify a number of gaps and shortfalls, particularly in relation to active consideration of social equity in the Blue Economy. We identify a range of recommendations on how these deficiencies may be addressed through a greater focus on a broader suite of objectives and a more inclusive approach to ocean meetings.

It accentuates that the emergence and subsequent reconfiguration of a particular scalar structure of environmental governance is the outcome of the discursive contest among various political actors, whose discourses acquire persuasive power through employing scale to frame how the world should be observed. In so arguing this paper distinguishes two moments of scale, as material political-environmental relations being shaped and as device shaping political-environmental relations. The connections of these two moments are illustrated by a case study based in the Pearl River Delta region of China, where scalar-implicated discourses were constructed by various tiers of the state to influence the scaling of the urban planning system, now being an important domain to perform environmental governance. With a scalar-discursive attention, this paper seeks to move towards a more holistic treatment of the obscured operational complexities of politics of scale.

In Australia, fisheries management involves a complex set of national and sub-national policy arrangements, including those designed to deliver against ecologically sustainable development (ESD) objectives. The complex policy framework makes ensuring policy coherence and avoiding unintended consequences difficult, particularly where potential trade-offs are not made explicit. Coherence, or potential policy weakness, of Australian fisheries management in relation to ESD objectives was examined in a subset of Australian wild capture fisheries, at national and jurisdictional scales. Coherent policy frameworks with ESD objectives were found to be more likely at the legislative-level across jurisdictions (horizontal coherence), than other levels of implementation. Many fisheries had problems demonstrating coherence between legislation and management plans due to lack of inclusion of ESD policy themes at management and operational levels. Case studies revealed substantial variation in the likelihood for horizontal and vertical coherence between fisheries policy frameworks managing the same species. The lack of explicit ESD objectives observed in many Australian fisheries suggests a high likelihood of incoherence in fisheries management, or alternatively that managers may be informally persuing higher levels of policy coordination and coherence than can be detected. Lack of detectability of coherence is problematic for demonstrating accountability and transparency in decision-making and public policy. Furthermore, use of discretion by managers when developing management plans, in order to overcome policy weakness, may lead to drifts in individual management direction within a jurisdiction.

J	Catney, P; Doyle, T				Catney, Philip; Doyle, Timothy			The welfare of now and the green (post) politics of the future	CRITICAL SOCIAL POLICY			English	Article						global North/South relations; governance; non-governmental organizations; post-materialism; sustainable development		This paper examines how key differences in the very manner in which the environment/welfare nexus is experienced and understood in both the global North and the global South are managed in favour of the former over the latter. We show how in the case of the global North - the more affluent world, such as Britain - environmental issues have been usually construed as post-materialist and/or post-industrialist. We argue that predominantly Northern-based post-materialists see environmental welfare (largely through the rhetoric of sustainable development and ecological modernization) as either something separate from humans (for the welfare of the 'rest of nature') or for the welfare of unborn, future generations. We use the concept of the 'post-political' to interpret how the global North dominates debates on the environment and how it can be quite dismissive, and even negligent, of welfare issues in the global South. In the case of the majority world, green welfare policy agendas are littered with the consequences of environmental devastation incurred through centuries of Northern oppression and resource exploitation. In the global South green welfare goals concentrate on the alleviation of those more basic needs of survival - provision of shelter, water availability, air quality, food sovereignty, and energy security - for those humans actually living on the planet; rather than those who may at some time in the future. In short, issues of environmental debt are writ large, rather than those of an imagined environmental future.

In addition to this direct link, whether corporate governance moderates this relation or not is tested. The analysis of data collected for 117 countries covers the period from 2007 to 2016. Primarily, the study provides robust evidence that green logistics performance has a significant and positive association with the existence and the number of sustainability reports within the logistics sector. This association is validated for the composite Logistics Performance Index (LPI) as well as all six individual logistics performance indicators. Furthermore, moderation analysis indicated that in weak corporate governance environments characterized by ineffective boards of directors, the logistics performance and sustainability reporting link is stronger. This means that sustainability reporting fills the gap arising from poor corporate governance. This study extends existing green supply chain management literature by testing, for the first time, the association between green logistics practices and sustainability reporting. It is hoped that it helps to align the logistics sector with more eco-friendly practices and alleviate growing concerns of environmental degradation it is assumed to cause. In the end, the study provides implications for sector representatives, supply-chain managers, and developing countries in particular. It suggests guidelines about how to improve each dimension of six LPI to contribute to the sustainable development of the sector. Moreover, as one of the dimensions of this study is sustainability reporting, communication of sustainable supply chain practices to customers and other stakeholders may help supply chain managers augment the competitive posture of companies in the market. The sector can benefit from the Global Reporting Initiative's individual metrics including materials usage, energy efficiency, recycling, and waste management metrics in developing environmentally friendly supply chains. The findings are particularly relevant for developing countries which are quite low scorers in terms of LPI than developed countries. Engaging in green logistics practices and developing policies accordingly may help them attenuate growing international environmental concerns and overcome trade barriers in international trade. The highlighted dimensions of green logistics performance may foster the circular economy while promoting the overall economic development of the countries. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In an attempt to generate hypotheses, we compared their attempts to maintain legitimacy, in its various aspects, for both their industries and the regulatory regimes that evolved as the controversies persisted. Both the existing literature and the two cases suggest that greater use of multi-sectoral stakeholder forums for the governance of cumulative impacts can bolster the legitimacy of both the industry and its regulatory regime, including those aspects handled through self-regulation. The cases suggested the additional hypotheses that (a) the importance of the decisions allocated to the multi-stakeholder regulatory forum affects legitimacy perceptions generally, and (b) the multi-stakeholder approach to regulation does little to bolster legitimacy when stakeholders include activists who are more interested in transnational issues than local cumulative impacts.

This paper presents the results of a recent study that was conducted with a number of German municipalities/cities. Based on the obtained and briefly presented recommendations emerging from the study, the authors propose the concept of an Urban Data Space (UDS), which facilitates an eco-system for data exchange and added value creation thereby utilizing the various types of data within a smart city/municipality. Looking at an Urban Data Space from within a German context and considering the current situation and developments in German municipalities, this paper proposes a reasonable classification of urban data that allows the relation of various data types to legal aspects, and to conduct solid considerations regarding technical implementation designs and decisions. Furthermore, the Urban Data Space is described/analyzed in detail, and relevant stakeholders are identified, as well as corresponding technical artifacts are introduced. The authors propose to setup Urban Data Spaces based on emerging standards from the area of ICT reference architectures for Smart Cities, such as DIN SPEC 91357 "Open Urban Platform" and EIP SCC. In the course of this, the paper walks the reader through the construction of a UDS based on the above-mentioned architectures and outlines all the goals, recommendations and potentials, which an Urban Data Space can reveal to a municipality/city. Finally, we aim at deriving the proposed concepts in a way that they have the potential to be part of the required set of tools towards the sustainable transformation of German and European cities in the direction of smarter urban environments, based on utilizing the hidden potential of digitalization and efficient interoperable data exchange.

We examine whether acquisition of targets with better ESG performance can help acquirers to increase their own ESG performance and whether the market values the increased ESG performance positively. Moreover, we explore whether the acquisition of targets with better ESG performance affects the market value of acquirers. For this study, we utilize a sample of 100 European mergers and acquisitions between 2003 and 2017, for which matching data on the ESG performance of both the target and acquiring firms are available. Our results show that the postmerger ESG performance of the acquirer increases following the acquisition of a target that has higher ESG performance than that of the acquirer in the premerger stage, whereas the postmerger market value of the acquirer increases following an increase in the acquirer's postmerger ESG performance in relation to its premerger ESG performance. Finally, we provide partial evidence of a positive relationship between the postmerger market value of the acquirer and the acquisition of a target with higher ESG performance than itself in the premerger stage.

J	Campillo-Alhama, C; Igual-Anton, D				Campillo-Alhama, Concepcion; Igual-Anton, Diego			Corporate Social Responsibility Strategies in Spanish Electric Cooperatives. Analysis of Stakeholder Engagement	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						corporate social responsibility; corporate governance; stakeholder engagement; sustainability; sustainable development goals	BUSINESS; CSR; MODEL	Cooperative organizations try to balance economic viability and corporate social responsibility (CSR) management through strategic policies that involve dialogue, participation, and engagement with stakeholders. To measure the impact of CSR management, the electricity sector implements monitoring processes and models, such as the sustainability reporting standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), which measure contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations 2030 Agenda. This research analyses the strategic management of CSR in the 28 electric cooperatives that market electricity in Spain with the aim of determining their level of commitment to CSR and stakeholder participation in their corporate policies. The analysis is based on the descriptive-exploratory study of the whole population of electric cooperatives. The results indicate that the CSR management of most electric cooperatives is still in an emerging stage within the Value Curve. Importantly, there is a significant percentage of cooperatives that have already advanced towards the consolidating and institutionalized stages. However, most of these social-economy organizations are not developing programs that link their CSR strategies with their priority SDGs and sustainability as a commitment to their community.

Fostering social cohesion might present a potential to enhance the connection of natural resource management and peacebuilding and better functioning of sustainable land use systems. This contribution explores the nexus between social cohesion, natural resource management, and peacebuilding. We do so by (1) reviewing literature on the three concepts and (2) studying four different key action areas in the context of sustainable cocoa production for their potential to enhance social cohesion, namely (a) agroforestry; (b) cooperatives; (c) certification schemes; and (d) trade policies. Research is based on experience from cocoa production in two post-conflict countries, Cote d'Ivoire and Colombia. Our findings show that by fostering environmentally sustainable agricultural practices, these key action areas have a clear potential to foster social cohesion among cocoa producers and thus provide a valuable contribution to post-conflict peacebuilding in both countries. However, the actual effects strongly depend on a multitude of local factors which need to be carefully taken into consideration. Further, the focus in implementation of some of these approaches tends to be on increasing agricultural productivity and not directly on fostering cocoa farmers' wellbeing and societal relations, and hence a shift toward social objectives is needed in order to strengthen these approaches as a part of overall peacebuilding strategies.

Focusing on the physical and functional city-port integration, the study investigates Naples harbour planning policy between twentieth and twenty-first centuries in order to identify the limitations of older instruments and to exam the current proposal, finally suggesting perspectives for the future. The analysis highlights the fact that, in the port of Naples, with a landlord governance, the main obstacles to a more inclusive planning policy have been related to land use conflict between on one hand the public interest of the Port Authority and Municipality and the private interest of port operators on the other. In conclusion, the need for city-port plan integration is outlined as a central planning issue so as to combine the economic development of the harbour with social, cultural and ecological themes and to overcome the conflicts between the different actors involved in the complex planning process.

However, state and non-state organisations can be involved in various forms of relationships, which may overlap but also extend beyond those that are encompassed by the often ill-defined terminology of 'partnerships'. The need for more nuanced conceptualisations of how relationships between state and non-state actors may be configured has become more urgent given that the advent of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) brings implications for the engagement of a broader array of sport stakeholders than from the SDP sector alone. Therefore, this article draws on existing categorisations in the development studies literature to identify six potential configurations of relationships between state and non-state actors associated with sport and development, namely: state-centred implementation, complementary implementation, co-produced implementation, non-state-centred implementation, state-led regulation, and non-state-led adversarial advocacy. In practice, the enactment of differently configured relationships will be influenced by political and economic contexts as well as the characteristics of relevant state and non-state actors. Configurations also vary in their utility according to the differing ways in which sport may contribute to particular SDGs and their constituent Targets. These complexities mean that the set of configurations is not presented as a deterministic model but is, rather, a heuristic by which policymakers, practitioners and researchers can improve analysis, relationships and, ultimately, the contributions of sport to development.

Almost all urban governing authorities rely on utilities to deliver goods and services. Provided that these utilities are essential for the healthy functioning of the economy, their governance shall be forward looking and sustainable. Thus, one of the key tasks of today's executives of such enterprise is to participate in and contribute to their organisations' strategies. Strategic analysis entails evaluating business goals, objectives and plans in light of a company focus on revenues maximisation. We argue that where enterprises dispose of a structured analyst aimed at analysing consumer's behaviour, business inclination toward innovation activities improve. This advantage stems different roots, e.g. from deeper knowledge of the economic and business environment, better ICT literacy and familiarity with customer relation management. Although some research limitations, the research outputs support our statements.

However, there a is surprisingly little academic research in urban design and planning field that discusses this phenomenon. Smart cities definition is similar to intelligent, creative, sustainable or liveable cities which appears to be considered as a part of a play with words. In most of the technological and social science articles smart cities refer to a smart urban management and development via technologies and infrastructure. Based on the scientific literature overview, there are several factors affecting the city smartness, such as technology, people and communities, economy governance, planning and infrastructure. Overall there is a little information and research on urban design principles and tools in the smart city's creation and contribution to its smartness. The most important thing is to clarify the urban design, planning and landscape design role importance to a smart city context and vice versa. The aim of this paper is to overview the smart cities concept from urban design perspective to find and highlight the important touch points, relation and role of urban design, planning and landscape design in smart cities creation. This would lead to the robust principles for smart European cities that would enable to achieve sustainable development, efficient urban growth and a better urban landscape.

Prospects for sustainable use of the pastoral areas of Australia's southern rangelands: a synthesis	RANGELAND JOURNAL			English	Review						grazing management; total grazing pressure; emerging land uses; infrastructure; invasive native scrub; biodiversity conservation; policy	TOTAL GRAZING PRESSURE; PATCH-SCALE HETEROGENEITY; STOCKING RATE; PERENNIAL GRASSES; LAND MANAGEMENT; FERAL GOATS; BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; SOUTHWEST QUEENSLAND; NORTHERN AUSTRALIA; NATURAL-RESOURCES	There is growing recognition of the need to achieve land use across the southern Australian rangelands that accommodates changing societal preferences and ensures the capacity of future generations to satisfy their own preferences. This paper considers the prospects for sustainable use of the pastoral lands based either on continued grazing or emerging, alternative land uses. After an overview of the southern rangelands environment, the status of the pastoral industry, its environmental impacts, and key issues for pastoral management, we propose four principles and 19 associated guidelines for sustainable pastoralism. Although some continued withdrawal of land from pastoralism is anticipated, we expect that pastoralism will continue throughout much of the region currently grazed, particularly in the higher rainfall environments in the east. Within these areas, sustainable pastoral land use should be achievable by the application of four broad management principles, as follows: (1) manage grazing within a risk management framework based on the concept of tactical grazing, (2) develop infrastructure to allow best management of both domestic and non-domestic grazing pressure, (3) incorporate management of invasive native scrub, where required, into overall, ongoing property management and (4) manage grazing to enhance biodiversity conservation at landscape scale. Application of these principles and guidelines will require the development of appropriate policy settings, particularly in relation to kangaroo management, climate change, and natural resource governance, together with innovative approaches to research, development and extension. Policy development will also be required if the new industry of carbon sequestration is to deliver socio-ecological benefits without perverse outcomes. Other emerging industries based on renewable energy or ecosystem services appear to have considerable potential, with little risk of adverse ecological consequences.

In this context, this paper aims to develop a conceptual framework for understanding the human-water system from the contradiction and co-evolutionary perspective. In this paper, the three contradiction relationships including those of human-water system, climate change and war condition, productive forces and production relations are analyzed by choosing six proxy indicators, and a set of historical data during 722 B.C.-1911 A.D., in China is used as the case study. Human and water is a co-evolution system as the coefficient of determination (R-2) between population and water governance activities is 0.9. Advanced productive forces and production relations play an important role in promoting population growth and water governance activities evidenced by high R-2 between any two of them. Generally, the co-evolutionary process of these three contradictions can be divided into three stages: slow development, moderate development and fast development. The conceptual framework developed in this study can be used to analyze the evolution of similar human-water systems in the world. Moreover, further research should be done through the simulation of the form and cycles of the three contradiction relationships.

J	Saez, MA				Arenilla Saez, Manuel			The Institutional Architecture and the Fulfilment of the 2030 Agenda in Iberoamerica	REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA			Spanish	Article						Institutional Development; Administrative Capability; Sustainable Development; Latin America; Spain; Portugal		The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development requires an institutional architecture that facilitates its governance and enables Iberoamerican countries to strengthen the necessary capacities to effectively meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). A good institutional design is required to achieve political and social confidence, certainty and democratic stability. The conception of the State and the Administration as a platform in which numerous actors interact to achieve the common good by means of the public drive is an essential element for the success of the Agenda 2030 and their SDG. This research contemplates the combination of factors or means and administrative functions as the basis of institutional strength. From here and the analysis of academic studies, documentation of numerous agencies, and Iberoamerican countries Voluntary National Reviews, the following variables arise to be considered in the design of an adequate institutional architecture: effective leadership, institutional mechanisms, institutional capacity, intergovernmental relations and participation / communication, which have been broken down into several dimensions. The research makes a series of proposals to improve the institutional architecture for the fulfilment of the 2030 Agenda in Iberoamerica. It is decisive in leadership to attribute the impulse of the 2030 Agenda to an organism with effective powers of coordination or planning on territorial and governmental agencies involved. It is necessary to make an effort in organizational simplification, in the integration of SDG into national planning mechanisms and the effective participation of the social actors. The budgetary and financial factor and statistics are having impact on the SDG in Iberoamerica. The territorialisation of the SDG is scarce, as also the regional and global alliances. The improvement of intergovernmental aspects and cooperation should be completed with a review of the international financing mechanisms. It is necessary to establish actual participation between social organizations and enterprises and public institutions.

The aim of this study is to analyze how public policies contribute to the strengthening of family farming in order to increase the food security. The study encompasses a literature review of the relations between public policies, family farming and food security and relates them with a review of the main policy framework in Brazil. The results show that the Brazilian policy framework in terms of strategies to strengthen food security is intrinsically focused on family farming and, in fact, these policies contribute to enhancing food security. Thus, family farming, in conjunction with large-scale fanning, is crucial to Brazilian and global food security. Even though there are some scientific publications on food security and official reports on the subjects in Brazil, little has been written about family farming as a strategy for public policies to enhance food security in Brazil. Therefore, this paper can potentially contribute to the literature on good governance in terms of agriculture and food security policies by presenting the well succeeded case of Brazil since the early 2000s.

Social innovation related to ecological crises: A systematic literature review and a research agenda for strong sustainability	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Review						Ecological crises; Environment; Strong sustainability; Weak sustainability; Sustainable development; Social innovation	POLICY; FRAMEWORK; CONSUMPTION; INITIATIVES; GOVERNANCE; MANAGEMENT; ECONOMICS; FORESTRY	New technologies, market-based solutions, and regulation have proven inadequate in remedying today's human caused ecological crises. This suggests that detrimental social practices need to be fundamentally changed. While social innovation is one possible approach for such change, a comprehensive picture of research on social innovation in relation to ecological challenges is missing. Therefore, with an emphasis on so-called strong sustainability, this article's purpose was to investigate social innovation's potential in relation to ecological crises, to identify important gaps, and advance research implications. A systematic literature review of social innovation research that address environmental issues was carried out, and the resulting literature was analyzed according to sustainability and five dimensions of social innovation. To reap more of social innovation's potential in our time of ecological crises, we suggest a move in social innovation research towards strong sustainability and propose such research avenues within each of the five dimensions of social innovation: conceptualization, environmental needs and challenges, key resources, capabilities, and constraints, types of governance, networks and actors, and, finally, process dynamics for strongly sustainable social innovation.

However, this heritage has been exposed to several environmental and human-created threats. This paper presents three European coastal regions with relevant CMCH and important tourism destinations: Ria de Aveiro (Portugal), the Small Isles (Scotland, UK) and Marsaxlokk (Malta). The paper draws attention to the challenges to CMCH they face, the dynamics between tourism and CMCH and provides recommendations for sustainable tourism exploitation of CMCH. A comparative case-study approach was undertaken, based on 41 semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders. Findings unveil that, despite the different demographics, socioeconomics and importance of tourism in each location, CMCH is seen as an important element to consider as tourism destination. Stakeholders identified economic, sociocultural and environmental0 dynamics between tourism and CMCH with positive and negative impacts on the regions. This study provides guidelines and recommendations that can be used as a reference to define a joint policy response for sustainable exploitation of CMCH in a tourism context.

C	Ludlow, D; Soukup, T		Ryser, J		Ludlow, David; Soukup, Tomas			URBIS Decision Support for Integrated Urban Governance	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 51ST ISOCARP CONGRESS			English	Proceedings Paper	Proceedings of the 51st ISOCARP Congress	OCT 19-23, 2015	ROTTERDAM, NETHERLANDS			urban sprawl; previously developed land; urban vacant land; EU Land Communication; integrated urban management; planning decision support tools		The challenges for the management of cities and city-regions in addressing the economic and societal dynamics facing Europe and Europe's cities today is evident in the complexity and interconnectedness of the global and pan-European drivers of change and their associated socio-economic, environmental and territorial impacts for urban environments. Integrated urban management processes emphasising horizontal integration across the sectoral agencies at the local level, and vertical integration between government agencies from city to EU level is identified as critical to the management of the city-region in relation to the key political objectives defined at both local and EU levels. The clear need for enhanced intelligence to support inter-agency collaboration and decision-making on territorial development as a central feature of integrated management is identified as a prime opportunity for URBIS solutions. Accordingly this paper presents an overview of the EU funded URBIS project (ICT PSP 2014-17) www.ict-urbis.eu. The project coordinated by GISAT, Prague investigates vacant land potentials in urban areas, and the opportunities for previously developed land or brownfield to support urban regeneration safeguarding greenfield sites. URBIS delivers assessment methodologies and tools to provide accurate up-to-date intelligence on urban vacant land opportunities that is comparable across European cities to support the definition and implementation of sustainable planning and governance strategies in cities and city-regions throughout Europe. The background to this innovative research and city pilot development are growing pan-European concerns with land taken for urban use, which annually converts almost 1000 km(2) of agricultural or natural land into artificial areas, as part of a wider European land degradation process. This land take process is driven by urban sprawl and infrastructure development, for example when new urban industrial or commercial areas are built on highly fertile agricultural land, rather than recycling abandoned or underused artificial sites. Land use efficiency is today a prime political objective at both European as well as city level, and the EU Land Communication aims to establish "zero net land take" across the EU by 2050. Central to the delivery of this policy is accurate intelligence on the availability and supply of previously developed "brownfield" land, as a key component of land-use decision making, maximising the net socio-economic benefits from land-use without degrading natural capital. The core objectives of URBIS presented in this paper aims to deliver this intelligence via urban planning decision support tools methodologies and assessments to realise the development potential of vacant and underused land in urban areas.

J	Wynberg, R; Hauck, M				Wynberg, Rachel; Hauck, Maria			People, Power, and the Coast: a Conceptual Framework for Understanding and Implementing Benefit Sharing	ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY			English	Article						coastal communities; governance; inequality; power	CORPORATE-SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; MARINE PROTECTED AREAS; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; SOUTHEAST-ASIA; FISHERIES; TOURISM; IMPACTS; POVERTY; AFRICA; UGANDA	The concept of benefit sharing has seen growing adoption in recent years by a variety of sectors. However, its conceptual underpinnings, definitions, and framework remain poorly articulated and developed. We aim to help address this gap by presenting a new conceptual approach for enhancing understanding about benefit sharing and its implementation. We use the coast as a lens through which the analysis is framed because of the intricate governance challenges which coastal social-ecological systems present, the increasing development and exploitation pressures on these systems, and the growing need to improve understanding about the way in which greater equity and reduced inequalities could reduce conflicts, protect coastal ecosystems, and ensure greater social justice. Key elements of the framework include the range of actors involved, the natural resources they access and use, the interventions introduced to redistribute benefits, and the benefits and losses that result from these interventions. The framework underscores the importance of process in determining who gets what, as well as the wider institutional, political, social, and economic context. Power relations and imbalances underpin many of these elements and remain the central reason for benefits being distributed in the way that they are. The framework has relevance and application for coastal livelihoods, rural governance, and resource sustainability in a context in which community rights are increasingly undermined through land grabbing, unequal power relations, and externally driven development interventions.

The idea of sustainability results from Schumpeter's analysis of "healthy" economic growth of about 2% per year (according to the analysis between 1890 and 1940, including the unsustainable pre-crisis growth of 3.8% / year between 1890 and 1929). Basically, the relationship between government action and corporate governance can be likened to the relationship between urban management and business management (the ultimate goal is to attract investors / stakeholders to the city / corporation by offering advantages over other areas with similar characteristics but keeping the sense of economic logic). to maintain a competitive environment over the local government apparatus and an effective relationship with the inhabitants of that city, respectively, to maintain an organizational culture that resonates with the employees and with the initial purpose of the business), thus this research work having a character of rationalization of the economic environment of an emerging state through an integrated corporate governance approach to the issue.

We highlight the extent to which problem and solution definitions were shared among participants, in relation to three specific issues on the agenda at Rio+20: conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction, small- scale fisheries, and ocean acidification. We find that discussions about each of these issues reflect three challenges recognized as complicating oceans management: mismatches between ecological and governance scale, homogeneity among interest groups advocating for ocean conservation, and increased interest in both protection and exploitation of ocean resources. Overall, we found little evidence of constructive dialogue at Rio+20, where participants focused on advancing predefined positions, and we consider the implications of our analysis for ultimately addressing our three focal issues and for oceans management more generally.

J	Olanya, DR				Olanya, David Ross			Land-Water-Security Nexus: Changing Geopolitics in the Nile Basin Cooperative Framework Agreement	MIDDLE EAST LAW AND GOVERNANCE			English	Article						climate variability; governance; land; water security; food; Nile Basin Cooperative Framework Agreement (CFA)	MANAGEMENT	This article extends the debate on the shift in water security governance in the Nile Basin countries. Water as an object of analysis was previously embedded in a depoliticized governance framework now faces politicization in the context of food, energy and climate change. In considering land-water-security nexus, population and climate variations drive Middle East and North Africa (MENA) policies for the return of the state primacy in water governance. As Egypt and Sudan maintain their dynamics of hegemony in Nile Basin countries, Gulf States however are deploying proxy water diplomacy through investment in agricultural farmlands in Nile Basin countries. Increasing number of actors alter water access and security across formal and informal domains. The Nile Basin Cooperative Agreement (CFA) remains contested between upstream and downstream riparian states as being uncoordinated water management and development policies. Incorporating market and local users beyond the state gets politicized in securing water security. In view of this, this article hence suggests that power relations are not static, but subject to the changing circumstances. Egypt's water security would be more sustainable when it engages CFA countries in a joint coordination and development projects.

J	Llano-Arias, V				Llano-Arias, Valeria			Community Knowledge Sharing and Co-Production of Water Services: Two Cases of Community Aqueduct Associations in Colombia	WATER ALTERNATIVES-AN INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL ON WATER POLITICS AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Community aqueducts; participatory communication; water governance; Colombia		Local-level participatory communication practices have enabled the opening of new democratic spaces in which decisions on water policies are taken. Through their resistance to water privatisation policies, many Colombian community aqueducts have made use of a transformed political and social role. Citizens from community aqueduct associations are generating new forms of political participation and citizenship, capable of challenging the widespread political apathy in the country. This article presents two case studies of community aqueduct associations in Colombia; exploring the scope of their communication and mobilisation actions in challenging power relations concerning water governance and in enhancing citizen participation in democratic actions. The article also explores how local water governance initiatives such as the development of a water management computer software with particular communitarian characteristics, can support local initiatives for political transformation and more sustainable water governance. These new forms of citizenship based on claims of sovereignty over natural, common goods are gradually transforming Colombian democratic space. The article draws on debates around active citizenship, deepening democracy, and participatory communication approaches to explain the aims of community organisations and the mechanisms by which they are self-organising and managing water at the local level.

J	Schutter, MS; Hicks, CC; Phelps, J; Waterton, C				Schutter, Marleen S.; Hicks, Christina C.; Phelps, Jacob; Waterton, Claire			The blue economy as a boundary object for hegemony across scales	MARINE POLICY			English	Article						Blue growth; Ocean economy; Ocean governance; Sustainable development; Small island developing states	FISHERIES; POLITICS; OCEAN; ECOLOGY; GRAMSCI; POLICY; POWER	The blue economy has become an influential concept in international and national marine governance discourse. Various contested interpretations exist, and different actors choose to emphasise different aspects of the triple goal of environmental, economic, and social improvements. However, despite disagreement over its interpretations, the blue economy finds support in many different arenas. This paper explores the position of dominance that the blue economy has reached, and examines how supporters of the concept maintain and employ power to keep it relevant. The paper applies a mixed-methods approach: 29 semi-structured interviews with people in roles of formal decision-making across the fisheries sector, economic development and tourism sector, conservation and environment sector, and specific blue economy-institutions are supplemented by observations from the wider landscape during 4 months of fieldwork in Seychelles. Findings show that in international discourse, the blue economy obtains and maintains its influence through persuasion and through the construction of a 'common sense' and productive way forward, capable of achieving triple wins. Within this narrative, oceans are undergoing a reconfiguration as economic frontiers, and the blue economy places economic growth from oceans centrally within contemporary environmental governance. Maintaining the blue economy as a powerful concept on the ground is done through social power relations: the blue economy functions as a boundary object, contributing to depoliticisation of discussions about a shared vision. Depoliticisation allows Seychelles to continue using the concept despite simmering dissent among policy makers, practitioners, and resource users. Dominance of the blue economy on the international stage means that associating with it brings Seychelles visibility and influence. The usefulness of the concept in eliding tensions makes it difficult for counterhegemony to arise, although alternatives are emerging elsewhere, such as blue justice. However, fundamental change is needed to re-politicise environmental decision-making and explicitly discuss values and images attached to the blue economy.

Although ocean policies in the South Pacific are well developed, there is negligible knowledge of the overall portfolio of initiatives and investment, especially in relation to Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG14; "life under water"). To assess past and future ocean-related activities in the Pacific region for refining future priorities, data for 14 Pacific island countries and territories was collated on (i) development-financed ocean-related projects active from 1997 to 2017, and (ii) Voluntary Commitments from the United Nations Oceans Conference of 2017. Across the 14 studied countries, there was a disjuncture between development-financed regional projects led by Intergovernmental Organisations and the predominantly government-led and single-country Voluntary Commitments. Projects supported by development finance in the Pacific region had a very narrow range of SDG14 targets, while the SDG14 targets of the Voluntary Commitments were much more widely spread over these targets. With well-developed Pacific Ocean policies, the role of SDG14 in the Pacific is specifically as a catalyst for transformative change. This requires shifting narrow development partner interests towards more innovative, self-sustainable and paradigm-changing investments. The opportunities afforded by SDG14 will be different in other oceans, however, effective global delivery requires clearer articulation of the role of SDG14 as the "game changer".

As these city populations expand, urban governance is even more of a daunting challenge in many countries. China is not an exception. It is at once a transitional state still undergoing urbanization and economic development; it is also currently experiencing a slowing economy. China's cities must simultaneously continue to improve the quality of urban life while maintaining social stability. Using the city of Guangzhou as an example of China's mega-cities, this study explores the financing strategies used by Chinese cities to manage urban growth. While economic growth has always been the main priority, Guangzhou's strategy has not followed China's traditional approach of growth for growth's sake; instead, it is relying on investment in innovation and transportation to promote the local economy. Education is also being stressed as a means of fostering human resources. However, undisciplined infrastructure financing and ineffective intergovernmental fiscal relations are jeopardizing the city's fiscal sustainability. To correct this will require further reforms of China's fiscal system and a careful sequencing of reforms to maintain a sustainable growth in the urban area.

THE ROLE OF PUBLIC COMPANIES IN CREATING A PLATFORM FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH IN SAINT PETERSBURG	BALTIC REGION			English	Article						economic growth; strategy for regional socioeconomic development; investment resources; public joint-stock companies; corporate governance	RETURN	Saint Petersburg has a special mission in delivering national development priorities, ensuring sustainable economic growth, and commercializing R&D. This necessitates research on the situation in the corporate sector, including investment potential and propensity to invest. The authors estimate the readiness of Saint Petersburg public companies to employ investment tools in delivering development strategies, which determine to a large extent the competitiveness of the city's economy. This article presents a study into the response of twenty local public companies to changes in the economy and their ability to stay efficient and preserve investment potential in volatile economic conditions. The measures taken by the companies are considered as inert and inefficient. The authors surveyed managers from 70 Russian non-public companies, who confirmed the hypothesis that businesses are interested in investing in the earning assets (securities) of other companies to receive interest (dividends). The respondents tend to associate the risk of such investments with the issuer's corporate control and corporate governance, which often fall short of best practices. The authors conclude that there is a need to improve knowledge of corporate relations, which affect competitiveness and the raising of funds necessary for sustainable economic growth in Saint Petersburg.

A CASE STUDY OF SINO-NIGERIAN ECONOMIC RELATIONS	ASIAN AFFAIRS			English	Article						Africa; Nigeria; Rentier State; China; Political Economy	INVESTMENT	This paper seeks to explore the political implications of China's economic relationship with Africa using the case study of Sino-Nigerian economic relations. China - perhaps the most prominent rising economy of the contemporary era - and Nigeria - one of the Africa's largest economies with a fast-growing consumer population - provide an ideal context to study the economic significance of bilateral ties for the 'Global South.' Nigeria's prospects of sustained economic growth, through Sino diplomatic relations, could appear relatively bleak considering issues involving its growing debt burden, unequal trade composition and deteriorating governance standards, some of which are attributable to China. This paper explores both sides of the argument before concluding that certain political aspects of Sino-Nigerian bilateral relations do indeed undermine sustainable economic development in the long run. It is argued that unequal economic practices, lack of transparency, disregard for environmental concerns, exclusion of civil society and absence of serious engagement with wider social actors and other checks and balances could indeed nurture elements of rentierism across Africa - particularly in resource-rich countries like Nigeria leaving significant detrimental effects that could well outweigh short-term gains.

J	Khan, SA				Khan, Sabaa Ahmad			Aligning Transnational Climate Action with International Climate Governance: The Road fromParis	REVIEW OF EUROPEAN COMPARATIVE & INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW			English	Article							PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY; ELECTRONIC WASTE; CHAINS; FLOWS	Electronic waste is recognized as the fastest growing hazardous waste stream of the twenty-first century. Because e-waste streams contain highly valuable precious metals and other secondary resources as well as hazardous toxic substances, the issue of their regulation lies at a liminal space between products and wastes. This complex legal interface engages the distinct and sometimes contradictory international regimes of liberalized trade and environmental protection. With most global flows of e-waste being treated by informal recycling industries in developing countries, and given the continued structural exclusion of these marginalized e-waste recycling sectors from official waste governance paradigms, the globalization of e-waste raises important environmental justice and North-South development issues. The present article examines the discussion of e-waste within international environmental law. In particular, it assesses new guideline developments under the Basel Convention on Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Waste and their Disposal. It is argued that despite its overarching objectives in relation to human health and environmental protection, the Basel Convention and the newly adopted Technical Guidelines on E-waste primarily ensure the continued circulation of obsolete electronic commodities in conditions that reproduce international externalities. The impossibility of this international environmental regime to foster any meaningful and authoritative notion of accountability over hazardous wastes that are generated through transboundary flows of 'products' inevitably limits its potential to curb the externalization of hazardous waste pollution to vulnerable populations who suffer the most acute health risks of global hi-tech production, consumption and reproduction. In essence, the success of this international regime over 'wastes' depends very critically on its coupling with national legislative controls over 'products' and more importantly, necessitates serious reflection on the legal dimensions of the notion of sustainable consumption.

The sample consists of 79 Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) partner countries, as these countries are entering a new age of integration, foreign trade, and mutual development. The empirical findings of conventional and robust estimators show that the financial development of BRI host countries significantly attracts FDI, while the institutional quality plays a significant moderating role in this relation. The in-depth analysis offers the insight that financial markets are less attractive to FDI relative to financial institutions. Thus, policymakers are advised to uphold sound financial institutions to make the country more attractive to overseas investors, while concentration on financial markets may multiply the benefits of FDI. The results are robust to alternative proxies of the key variables and alternative methodologies.

PLOS ONE			English	Article							PROTECTED AREAS; LAND-USE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DEFORESTATION; AMAZON; FORESTS; CONSERVATION; VARIABILITY; PREVENTION; CARBON	Tropical forests are experiencing a growing fire problem driven by climatic change, agricultural expansion and forest degradation. Protected areas are an important feature of forest protection strategies, and sustainable use reserves (SURs) may be reducing fire prevalence since they promote sustainable livelihoods and resource management. However, the use of fire in swidden agriculture, and other forms of land management, may be undermining the effectiveness of SURs in meeting their conservation and sustainable development goals. We analyse MODIS derived hot pixels, TRMM rainfall data, Terra-Class land cover data, socio-ecological data from the Brazilian agro-census and the spatial extent of rivers and roads to evaluate whether the designation of SURs reduces fire occurrence in the Brazilian Amazon. Specifically, we ask (1) a. Is SUR location (i.e., de facto) or (1) b. designation (i.e. de jure) the driving factor affecting performance in terms of the spatial density of fires?, and (2), Does SUR creation affect fire management (i.e., the timing of fires in relation to previous rainfall)? We demonstrate that pre-protection baselines are crucial for understanding reserve performance. We show that reserve creation had no discernible impact on fire density, and that fires were less prevalent in SURs due to their characteristics of sparser human settlement and remoteness, rather than their status de jure. In addition, the timing of fires in relation to rainfall, indicative of local fire management and adherence to environmental law, did not improve following SUR creation. These results challenge the notion that SURs promote environmentally sensitive fire-management, and suggest that SURs in Amazonia will require special attention if they are to curtail future accidental wildfires, particularly as plans to expand the road infrastructure throughout the region are realised. Greater investment to support improved fire management by farmers living in reserves, in addition to other fire users, will be necessary to help ameliorate these threats.

In this paper, a case study for the so-called new type of urbanization of Huaming Town in the third largest city of Tianjin, China will be discussed. Compared with the conventional policy and practice, Tianjin's innovative land and housing policy of rural homestead replacement, the key to Huaming's urbanization, has numerous distinctive advantages. With a holistic approach, the description and analysis of Huaming's transformation from a suburban town into an integrated part of Tianjin metropolis illuminate the logic behind China's concurrent practices for urban development. Moreover, it focuses on Huaming's growth agenda by paying attention to its competitiveness of local economic activity, diversification of income generation and employment policy, as well as social inclusion process including neighborhood development and harmonious relations within the communities.

J	Kidd, S; Calado, H; Gee, K; Gilek, M; Saunders, F				Kidd, Sue; Calado, Helena; Gee, Kira; Gilek, Michael; Saunders, Fred			Marine Spatial Planning and sustainability: Examining the roles of integration - Scale, policies, stakeholders and knowledge	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Marine spatial planning; Marine governance; Integrated marine policy		Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) has been heralded as the key means of achieving a more integrated approach to marine use across sectors and spatial scales. Achieving greater integration and coherence in MSP governance arrangements is seen as a way to resolve current problems of marine governance (such as fragmentation) and address future resource demands in a sustainable way. However, there is a lack of clarity and consensus in practice regarding sustainability in MSP, both in terms of MSP governance practices and sustainable resource use. For example, how are we to treat the environment in MSP? Should we conceive the environment as just another sector with interests to be negotiated, or as the very boundary condition that limits possibilities for maritime activities and developments? How do we integrate diverse views on this in MSP decision-making? This is but one example of an integration challenge in MSP important for sustainability. There are numerous others. Integration is intimately connected to the ability of MSP to deliver sustainable marine resource use at various levels and scales. The roles of integration are diverse and interconnected, including those that affect social-ecological integration or land-sea interaction, but also aspects of good governance and social sustainability. The latter include inter-sectoral decisionmaking, stakeholder engagement, cross-border interaction and knowledge pluralism. How integration is exercised in these procedural aspects of MSP is likely to substantively affect outcomes both in terms of sustainable blue growth or the ability to deliver an ecosystem-based approach. Integration as a policy and analytical problem to be addressed has also been discussed elsewhere - most saliently in the fields of sustainable development, ICZM, environmental policy integration, planning theory and socio-ecological systems. While there has been some work on integration in MSP, additional insight is needed: to better empirically ground the roles of integration in MSP, to understand the multidimensionality and interdependencies of integration dimensions and to unpack what 'balance' might mean for understanding and pursuing sustainability in different MSP contexts. In response, this special issue aims to explore the roles, problems and opportunities of various types of integration in relation to MSP's sustainability ambitions.

We examine the need to explain how to utilise the SDGs in strategic, tactical and operative urban development. We find that there are knowledge and practise gaps in how to localise SDGs in the urban context. This need and the lack of existing tools has led to the development of a strategic sensemaking process, which has been tested and developed with municipal and other practitioners, locally and globally. The paper presents findings from this process of development and from implementation pilots, including an SDG Sensemaking Tool (SST), a step by step iterative procedure to address these gaps. The main focus of this paper is the SDG Sensemaking process, which relies on analysing SDGs in relation to any given phenomena or project within or outside a city. The first results in this work-in-progress show that it contributes to an understanding on the complexity of how SDGs are related to the analysed phenomena, and catalyses the SDG localisation process, which helps make sense of how to navigate and measure progress in such complex environments. More research and applications are, however, needed, so as to further understand how urban governance can meet holistic, sustainable-development needs. Future work will, firstly, comprise further integrating SDGs into city-level strategies with a focus on the local, regional, national, and global impact on sustainable development and the actualisation of SDGs, and secondly, on further developing SST so that it can serve these purposes.

Using a mixed-methods approach and a gender-sensitive collective action analytical framework, this article quantifies the role of women in drinking-water governance and identifies barriers to women's participation. The findings show that women not only are more willing to contribute but have also stated higher actual contribution than their male counterparts. The article outlines the institutional and individual attributes constraining women's effective participation in water management and suggests how to enhance women's participation in water governance. We argue that a strategy built on water users' collective action in Uganda has to be built on women's participation through effective rules and monitoring mechanisms, as well as on long-term sensitization and awareness creation on gender stereotypes that hitherto hinder women's participation.

In this paper, we investigate the construction of the 2 A degrees C climate target, one of the best known targets in global environmental governance. Our paper examines this target through a historical reconstruction that identifies four different phases: framing, consolidation and diffusion, adoption, and disembeddedness. Our analysis shows that, initially, the target was science-driven and predominantly EU-based; it then became progressively accepted at the international level, despite a lack of broader debate among governments on the policy implications and required measures for implementation. Once the 2 A degrees C target was endorsed at the level of the United Nations, the nature of the target changed from being policy-prescriptive to being largely symbolic. In this phase, the target became a disembedded object in global governance not linked to a shared agenda nor to coordinated and mutually binding mitigation efforts. The 2015 Paris Agreement marks the last stage in this development and may have further solidified the target as a disembedded object. In the final part of the paper, we suggest ways to overcome the current situation and to develop the 2 A degrees C target into a fully fledged global environmental governance target.

UN Stabilisation Operations and the Problem of Non-Linear Change: A Relational Approach to Intervening in Governance Ecosystems	STABILITY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SECURITY AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							POLITICAL ORDERS; NON-STATE	In recent years, the United Nations (UN) has increasingly turned towards stabilisation logics in its peace operations, focusing on the extension of state authority in fragile, conflict-prone areas. However, this concept of stabilisation relies upon a series of binaries - formal/informal actors, licit/illicit activities, governed/ungoverned space - which often distort the far more complex power relations in-conflict settings. As a result, UN peace operations tend to direct resources towards state institutions and ignore a wide range of non-state entities, many of which are-crucial sources of governance and exist at the local and national level. In response, this article places the UN's stabilisation approach within a recent trend in peace research focused on the hybrid nature of socio-political order in conflict-affected regions, where non-state forms of governance often have significant and legitimate roles. Rather than replicate misleading state/non-state binaries, the article proposes a relational approach and develops a novel analytical framework for analysing a wide range of governance actors in terms of different forms of symbiotic relationships. It then applies this approach to specific examples in Mali and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), demonstrating the highly networked power arrangements present in conflict settings. The article posits that a relational approach would avoid many of the false assumptions at the heart of today's stabilisation interventions and would instead allow the UN to design more effective, realistic strategies for pursuing sustainable peace in modern conflict settings. It concludes that relationality could be used more generally, including to explain the waning potency of the so-called 'third wave' of democratisation.

THE FORMATION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL AGENDA OF THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY (1946-2016)	MGIMO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS			English	Article						International agenda; United Nations General Assembly; environment; resources; desertification; sovereignty; sustainable development; environmental problems; nuclear weapon		The history of an environment as an issue of the international politics pays remarkably little attention to the circumstances in which the environmental agenda develops and to its constitutive issues. The Stockholm Conference on the human environment is one of the important milestones that made the environment as an issue of international concern. However, its success would be impossible without the immense experience in addressing environmental issues gathered at the multilateral level. A review of the literature on the research topic shows that the term "environmental agenda" is not always used properly, there is a lack of empirical data to explain the "greening" of international relations. Indeed, given the fragmented nature of international environmental governance, specifically within the framework of the United Nations, it is difficult to trace the evolution of the environmental agenda from the first days of Organization to the present. For identification and definition of the content of the environmental agenda, the authors used the content analysis of the title of the resolutions of the UN General Assembly adopted in the period from 1946 to 2016. The research identified environmental issues of high priority: sovereignty over resources, environment, sustainable development, desertification, climate, natural disasters. The analysis made it possible to track their appearance on the agenda in chronological order, Also, we identified the issues underlying the formation of the environmental agenda of the General Assembly, namely international security issues related to nuclear weapons and economic development. In addition, we examined some voting patterns on environmental issues, the dynamics of changes in the attention of UN member states to key issues such as sustainable development, desertification, climate, sovereignty over natural resources.

We adapted and applied a model for evaluating sustainability transition experiments to visualize what ought to be the ingredients of an experimental agenda focused in advancing the country's marine spatial planning (MSP) as a fundamental instrument for achieving a shared Vision of blue economy for Brazil. Our results point that such a vision does not currently exist to guide the ocean governance system, raising attention for potential gaps in the consideration of environmental sustainability and social equity that needs to be addressed when shaping one. We discuss what ought to be the core ingredients of a national-level transition experiment for advancing MSP in Brazil (inputs, processes, outcomes and results). The adoption of a network-based MSP transition experiment in Brazil, from an initial technically-oriented to a subsequent process-oriented approach, may improve the sociopolitical arena's functional ocean governability, by (1) promoting a process-framework for improving the overall presence and quality of area-based governance-related knowledge-exchange; (2) supporting the policy-innovators quest for integrated governance through imagination and rationalization of appropriate institutional changes; (3) providing space for streamlining disparate governance responses into co-evolutionary pathways; (4) measuring improvements in the performance of innovative governance attempts; and (5) allowing for involved parties to confront asymmetric power relations in the shaping of a more environmentally sustainable and socially equitable ocean economy.

The concept provides important opportunities to help examine how rapid and fundamental change to address contemporary global challenges can be facilitated. This paper contributes to discussions about transformation by providing a social science, arts and humanities perspective to open up discussion and set out a research agenda about what it means to transform and the dimensions, limitations and possibilities for transformation. Key focal areas include: (1) change theories; (2) knowing whether transformation has occurred or is occurring; (3) knowledge production and use; (4) governance; (5) how dimensions of social justice inform transformation; (6) the limits of human nature; (7) the role of the utopian impulse; (8) working with the present to create new futures; and (9) human consciousness. In addition to presenting a set of research questions around these themes the paper highlights that much deeper engagement with complex social processes is required; that there are vast opportunities for social science, humanities and the arts to engage more directly with the climate challenge; that there is a need for a massive upscaling of efforts to understand and shape desired forms of change; and that, in addition to helping answer important questions about how to facilitate change, a key role of the social sciences, humanities and the arts in addressing climate change is to critique current societal patterns and to open up new thinking. Through such critique and by being more explicit about what is meant by transformation, greater opportunities will be provided for opening up a dialogue about change, possible futures and about what it means to re-shape the way in which people live.

What restrains Ethiopian NGOs to participate in the development of policies for natural resource management?	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Proclamation; Governance; Network; Land policy; Land use change; Oromia; Sustainable land management	CENTRAL RIFT-VALLEY; LAND-USE; NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS; CIVIL-SOCIETY; GOVERNANCE; CONSERVATION; ACCOUNTABILITY; POLITICS; CAMEROON	By law, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Ethiopia are severely restricted in their activities towards policy development. In this study we explore to what extent these restrictions have affected NGOs in Natural Resource Management in the Oromia regional state of Ethiopia. We quantitatively analyzed 106 semi-structured questionnaires, in order to assess 1) the general characteristics of these NGO, 2) the role of NGOs in natural resource management, 3) the factors that constrain their activities, especially in relation to the proclamation, and 4) the cooperation between NGOs as well as other stakeholders. Results indicate that NGOs are mainly involved in policy implementation, including afforestation, forest management, and soil and water conservation. We find that a more active role in agenda setting and policy formulation is hampered by the 2009 proclamation, which explicitly restricts the role of Ethiopian Residence Charities/Societies (ERCS) and Foreign Charities (FC). Consistently, NGOs, as well as their donors, often avoid involvement in policy development, in fear of potential collusion with the government. In addition, NGOs listed legal and administrative barriers, poor networking and cooperation among NGOs, lack of capacity, lack of information, and a lack of clear role on policy issues as constraints for influencing policies for natural resource management. The extent to which these factors affect NGOs is dependent on their type and the source of their funding.

The Brazilian organic food sector: Prospects and constraints of facilitating the inclusion of smallholders	JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES			English	Article						Organics; Smallholders; Brazil; Food systems; Farmers' organizations; Development policies; Economic development; Social relations	CERTIFICATION; FARMERS; MARKET	The Brazilian organic food sector has experienced important growth during the last two decades. Brazilian smallholders, however, are facing huge challenges to enter and benefit from this growth in a sustainable way. Combining the lens of New Institutional Economics and socio-anthropology, we analyze six experiences of Brazilian smallholders who converted to organics in the 1990s'. Three different food systems are featured in this analysis: an alternative food system, which is strongly interwoven with the Brazilian Agro-ecological movement and two commercial food procurement systems oriented towards domestic and an export markets driven mainly by supermarket chains. The analytical focus was on 1) the governance of these food systems, 2) the constraints farmers are facing within these food systems and, 3) the benefits that they can expect from market inclusion. We highlighted the roles that NGOs, Faith-based organizations and public-related agencies play in supporting the inclusion of smallholders into all three food systems. We confirmed the arguments in support of pursuing the agro-ecological development based model in Brazil, but underlined that there is a critical lack of support for farmers included in the commercial market-oriented food systems. Such a lack is even more critical as the food systems driven by expanding supermarket chains are characterized by strong asymmetric power relations at the expense of smallholders. Considering the reluctance of NGOs and Faith-based organizations to support these farmers, we call for efforts to be made to provide a policy framework to enable public-related entities to secure sustainable inclusion into these systems and exit strategies for those experiencing exclusion from these highly competitive food systems.

J	Krauss, J				Krauss, Judith			Representing environment and development - tracing links between drivers, representations and power dynamics in cocoa sustainability and beyond	JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Representations; cocoa; sustainability; ethical consumption; environment; global South; development; political ecology	GLOBAL PRODUCTION NETWORKS; FAIR-TRADE; POLITICAL ECOLOGY; NARRATIVES; CERTIFICATION; CONSUMPTION; WILDERNESS; GOVERNANCE	How much do misleading representations matter? This article examines carefully constructed narratives of engagement in 'sustainable' cocoa production initiatives, which fail to mention one of the actual key drivers: the need to shore up production in the long term in an embattled sector. Consequently, representations also downplay the need for systemic change, reproducing the power asymmetries they claim to change. The research seeks to establish to what degree public-facing communication differs from underlying priorities in terms of forefronting altruism over necessity, and whether this is problematic for the initiatives' overall outcome. Through semi-structured interviews, focus-group discussions, documentary analysis and participant observation in Latin America and Europe, it reviews relations in two cocoa sustainability initiatives with environmental foci. Crucially, the research establishes a link between representations, underlying priorities and the degree to which they (re)produce pre-existing power asymmetries between global North and global South, private sector and other stakeholders in the industry, speaking to a variety of political ecology questions. It argues that public-facing, altruism-focused communication distracts from the sector's underlying systemic issues: the emphasis on altruism works to reduce pressure to transform power asymmetries and omnipresent inequalities.

J	Koralagama, D; Gupta, J; Pouw, N				Koralagama, Dilanthi; Gupta, Joyeeta; Pouw, Nicky			Inclusive development from a gender perspective in small scale fisheries	CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article							LAKE VICTORIA; WOMEN; ISLAND; CONSERVATION; LIVELIHOODS; GOVERNANCE; STRATEGIES; ACCESS; POOR	Gender inequality and discrimination challenges the social economic and environmental sustainability of the global small-scale fisheries sector critically in achieving inclusive development. The absence of a gender-aware perspective in fisheries research is often justified from the premise that fisheries are a male-dominated sector. Although, millions of women are engaged in small-scale fisheries their work has been systematically discounted and devalued. This paper reviews the gender literature on small-scale fisheries to elaborate on the gender discrimination on; labor division, accessibility, and power relations, which hinder the sustainability and development process in marginalized communities. Ironically, women often contribute to such discriminatory processes in access and control of resources and decision making thus directly affecting on household and community wellbeing. The paper concludes that gender sensitive research can help to ensure that the conditions for achieving the sustainable development goals are met especially in the context of expected global stress on fisheries from climate change and development processes.

The research question underpinning the analyses presented in this paper is: are the indicators in the SDGs sufficient and fit for purpose to assess the trajectory of natural resources towards sustainability? We extracted the SDG indicators that monitor the state of natural resources, or alternately support policy or governance for their protection, and determined whether these are adequate to provide the essential data on natural resources to achieve the aims of the SDGs. The indicators are clustered into four natural resource categories-land, water (both marine and freshwater), air and biodiversity. Indicators for monitoring land resources show that the most comprehensive land resource indicator for degraded land is not fully implemented and that missing from land monitoring is an evaluation of vegetation health outside of forests and mountains, the condition of soils, and most importantly the overall health of terrestrial ecosystems. Indicators for monitoring water resources have substantial gaps, unable to properly monitor water quality, water stress, many aspects of marine resources and, most significantly, the health of fresh and salt water ecosystems. Indicators for monitoring of air have recently become more comprehensive, but linkage to IPCC results would benefit both programs. Monitoring of biodiversity is perhaps the greatest weakness of the SDG Agenda, having no comprehensive assessment even though narrow aspects are monitored. Again, deliberate linkages to other global biodiversity programs (e.g., CBD and the Post-2020 Biodiversity Framework, IPBES, and Living Planet) are recommended on condition that data can be defined at a country level. While the SDG list of indicators in support of natural resource is moderately comprehensive, it lacks holistic monitoring in relation to evaluation of ecosystems and biodiversity to the extent that these missing but vital measures of sustainability threaten the entire SDG Agenda. In addition, an emerging issue is that even where there are appropriate indicators, the amount of country-level data remains inadequate to fully evaluate sustainability. This signals the delicate balance between the extent and complexity of the SDG Agenda and uptake at a country level.

The main objective of the paper is to identify and evaluate how innovations and networking contribute to tourist destination development in Slovakia. The implementation of institutional innovation resulted in the establishment of formal and informal networks. The developed networks consist of representatives of all sectors co-ordinating all relevant stakeholders. Formal and informal networks and the collaboration among stakeholders have launched other types of innovations in the tourism sector. The interactions and intensity of relations among stakeholders are analysed by network analysis. Destinations are compared with the network of the same size and density through quantitative network characteristics. Based on empirical research we investigate the impact of networks and innovations on tourist destination development. Due to the synergy effect of networking and implementation of multiple innovations, tourist destination development is observed.

S	Georgiadou, MC		Bishop, J		Georgiadou, Maria Christina			Future-Proofed Design of Low-Energy Housing Developments: Case Studies from the UK and Sweden	BUILDING SUSTAINABLE CITIES OF THE FUTURE	Green Energy and Technology		English	Article; Book Chapter						Energy; Future-proofing; Housing developments; Lifecycle; Uncertainty	HOMES	This study examines the concept of 'future-proofing' the energy design of housing developments so as to achieve low levels of energy consumption and carbon emissions over their lifecycle. This refers particularly to the selection of fabric energy efficiency measures and onsite low-or zero-carbon technologies (microgeneration or local energy networks) at an early design stage. The research adopts a multiple case study method with data gathered from two 'best-practice' housing developments in the UK and Sweden, namely North West Cambridge (Cambridgeshire) and Valle Broar (Vaxjo). The research explores the future-proofed approaches used in the two cases in relation to a pre-established conceptual framework, which involves two aspects, namely adopting lifecycle thinking and accommodating risks and uncertainties. The cross-case analysis reveals that there is widespread experimentation, which demonstrates that future-proofing is still in its infancy. Drivers for future-proofing mostly prompt strategies to accommodate risks and uncertainties in the UK, whereas in Sweden, they lead to the adoption of lifecycle thinking.

The chapter concludes with the need to transfer knowledge to mainstream housing construction and inform policy-making in relation to long-term performance over a project's full lifecycle.

J	Mazur, K; Tomashuk, I				Mazur, Kateryna; Tomashuk, Inna			GOVERNANCE AND REGULATION AS AN INDISPENSABLE CONDITION FOR DEVELOPING THE POTENTIAL OF RURAL AREAS	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES			English	Article						rural areas; development management; reform; state support; decentralization; modernization		The subject of the study is the rural territories and settlements of the country, which are influenced by the conflicting processes of reforming the economic basis of their development, which increases the uncertainty and causes the emergence of social risks in terms of organization of economic activity and obtaining the required level of labor income and, accordingly, the level and quality of life. The current transformational changes in rural areas, amid the processes of decentralization of the current management system, create new conditions that are more or less conducive to the successful organization of rural residents' livelihoods. The urgent task of today is to study the practical problem of the effective development of rural territories, the insufficiency of its development and the complex tasks of revitalization of rural territories of their resource potential in the context of intra-regional features of rural development, which is the basis for carrying out scientific research in accordance with these topics. The purpose of the study is to explore ways to solve problems of regional development, especially rural development, which has never been neglected by economic science, since sustainable development of the country and its regions is impossible without the social revival of the village. Also, a comprehensive theoretical and practical study of issues of management and state regulation of rural development, in particular, the substantiation of socio-economic and environmental problems of the development of the Ukrainian village, the isolation of rural areas, the formation of organizational and economic mechanism of state support for their development and implementation of modern state agricultural policy. Methodology. The problematic of the development of the potential of rural territories is based on the use of multifaceted scientific methods of knowledge of phenomena and processes. Application of statistical methodology in the process of analyzing the dynamics and tendencies of rural development, the effective functioning of agriculture, which is the basis for the study of problems of rural development in general. Economic and statistical research is based on specific techniques, their totality forms the methodology of statistics (methods of mass observations, groupings, generalizations, time series, index method, etc.). Results. In the conditions of formation of market relations in rural areas, especially in the period of economic instability in the country, the study of preconditions for ensuring balanced potential of rural development on the basis of internally oriented motivational factors, justification of priority types of economic activity of rural territories of the region with observance of ecological requirements becomes extremely relevant. One of the main areas to reform the regional development management mechanism is the development of local initiative. The practical implementation is to use the method of delegation of authority as one way of establishing the competence of local public authorities, which is an important part of the decentralization of the executive power, and is of great importance for all processes of the rule of law and, in particular, for improving the efficiency of the local government system. public authority. The Institute of Delegation of Authority in the current context is important for the functioning of public authority in rural areas. In addition, the introduction of a programmatic targeting method in the budgetary process of rural development will help to ensure transparency of the budgetary process, which will clearly define the goals and objectives for which the budgetary resources of the region are spent, which in turn will increase the level of control over the results of implementation of budgetary programs. This approach will improve the quality of fiscal policy-making, the efficiency of distribution and the use of budgetary resources in rural areas. Value/originality. State policy in Ukraine on regulating the potential of land relations should be aimed at solving the organizational and legal problems that have accumulated in recent years and to address the social negatives of land transformation in the countryside.

However, the benefits of these kinds of spaces are unevenly distributed within cities in relation to the location or income level. In this article, it is evident that the use and quality of public green spaces are often neglected in deprived neighborhoods. This article analyses the structure, the use and perception, and the governance of public parks in La Pradera, a deprived peripheral neighborhood of the Metropolitan Zone of Queretaro, Mexico. The results show that the design and quality of these public green spaces are not a priority in peripheral settlements. Moreover, the case demonstrates that negative perceptions, such as those of danger and discomfort within public parks, discourage utilization by inhabitants. Finally, the design, construction, and maintenance of these spaces are in the hands of real estate companies versus the State that neglects public services, which results in segregation of those individuals who are unable to pay for private goods and services. The development of parks should respond to deliberate planning processes involving citizens as powerful agents.	[Ribeiro-Palacios, Monica; Gomez, Claudia A.

J	Buser, M				Buser, Michael			The production of space in metropolitan regions: A Lefebvrian analysis of governance and spatial change	PLANNING THEORY			English	Article						city-region; metropolitan; Lefebvre; spatial theory; post-political	CITY-REGIONS; UNEVEN DEVELOPMENT; POLITICS; PLACE; CONSTRUCTION; GEOGRAPHIES; DEMOCRACY; POLICY; STATE	The language of relational geography now permeates the field and literature of planning, with phrases such as 'fuzzy boundaries' and 'flows and networks' being commonly used to express the complexity of socio-economic and governance relations. However, recent research suggests the so-called 'relational turn' is not only far from complete, but is unable to account for the bounded reality of urban processes. Following from these debates, this article seeks to redirect the study of urban change away from relational and absolute interpretations of space in favour of a more robust consideration and critical reflection on the social production of city-regions. Towards this objective, the author introduces an approach situated within Lefebvre's The Production of Space to examine strategies of metropolitan regionalism in the Capital District, New York (United States). Interpreting the city-region as a social product reflecting the co-constitutive relationship of conceived, perceived and lived space spatial elements, the paper argues that the silences of lived space within metropolitan regionalism are indicative of a post-political condition where hegemonic vision, discourse and ideology deny a robust urban democracy. It is this ability to engage with the dynamism of social change and the relationships between spaces which makes Lefebvre's spatial theory immensely valuable for the study of emerging and shifting structures of governance.

A body of research has cast doubt on the normative European representation of the multi-centre PUR as a balanced, sustainable spatial development model. Yet, the model has continued to be propagated in European territorial strategy and has been influential internationally. Academic perspectives and qualitative evidence reviewed in the paper shed a light on mutual dependencies and recursive relations between network economy global structural processes, international office real estate investment practices mediated by city governments, and the spatial configuration of density. Commercial investment and city planning actor practices chime with urban agglomeration, spatial concentration and density. Quantitative evidence of associations between urban density and office real estate investment returns and capital flows is found. It is concluded that network economy topology, politics and the city are in a dialectical relationship with the PUR territorial governance agenda for spatially balanced regional development.

In order to explore the complexities of this governmental problem, we will propose the concept of postcolonial Islamic governmentality. Drawing on Foucault's work on the arts of government, with Dean's (2010) writing on illiberal governmentalities, and the work of Salehin (2016) on pious governmentality in Bangladesh, we will suggest that postcolonial Islamic governmentalities emerge at the intersections of the legacies of British colonialism in Pakistan's post-colonial governance; the influence of processes of neo-liberal globalisation in the policies of developing countries by donor countries, development NGOs and the SDGs; and the forms of Islamic governance embedded in the juridical, cultural, social and gender relations of Pakistan as a postcolonial, Islamic state.

Recently, the idea of digital sovereignty has started to increasingly gain more supporters among nation states. This article is a case study on the Russian concept of a "sovereign internet." In 2019, the so-called law on sustainable internet marked a new milestone in the development of RuNet. Drawing on document analysis and expert interviews, I reconstruct Russia's strategic narrative on internet sovereignty and its evolution over time. I identify the main factors that have shaped the Russian concept of sovereignty, including domestic politics, the economy, international relations, and the historical trajectory of the Russian segment of the internet. The article places the Russian case in a global context and discusses the importance of strategic narratives of digital sovereignty for the future of internet governance.

J	Sgroi, F				Sgroi, Filippo			Evaluating of the sustainability of complex rural ecosystems during the transition from agricultural villages to tourist destinations and modern agri-food systems	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND FOOD RESEARCH			English	Article						Rural development; Rural villages; Rural tourism; Gastronomic tourism; Territorial development		Many agricultural villages have transformed from traditional agricultural communities into tourist destinations to eliminate the progressive degradation, abandonment, ecological and social crises that threaten sustainable development. Today rural villages are complex ecosystems that represent the result of the historical relationship between man and nature in the socio-economic dimension. A tool for assessing the sustainability of rural villages is the analysis of the interaction between man and the environment. Preserving healthy rural ecosystems, in dynamic balance with the interrelation between social development and the functioning of the natural ecosystem is an indispensable goal of sustainable development. All this leads to what the current traditional economic studies have ignored namely the study of the reasons of the economic reference indicators to suggest technical solutions, change strategies and sustainability for rural governance systems within of social development. This article proposes an economic study approach that integrates social and economic evaluation to research sustainable development models and socio-economic factors to achieve the well-being of the rural system. Considering Borgo Parrini, located in Sicily, the historical analysis has been combined with the social-economic one and linked to models of social development (traditional agriculture, industrialized agriculture and commercial tourism). Based on the methodology, economic indicators of the crops implemented in the countryside surrounding the rural village under examination were obtained and the corresponding socio-economic factors that have characterized the village from its birth to the present day were also reconstructed. The results show that the Borgo was born with the aim of being at the service of the agricultural activity of the neighboring countryside. The evolution of historical facts and the changes induced by the economic development models adopted in Italy have led to a transformation from a neighborhood agriculture to an industrialized agriculture. This model of agriculture adapted to the studied area had a negative impact and led to the impoverishment of the countryside and the removal of man from the territory. The potential impacts were explored with the evolution of the agricultural landscape and with the analysis of the economic activities in the area. The changes in the use of resources on the welfare of the system and their results indicate that technical solutions must be integrated with a governance system based on the relations of production, community and culture. To adopt a sustainable development model, it is recommended to use environmentally friendly agricultural techniques, methods of ecotourism and participatory governance between agriculture and tourism. The method proposed here for integrated governance provides a new perspective for the implementation of technical solutions in human society and the formation of sustainable development models that are positive for the rural, social and economic environment.

J	Vogelpohl, T				Vogelpohl, Thomas			Transnational sustainability certification for the bioeconomy? Patterns and discourse coalitions of resistance and alternatives in biomass exporting regions	ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIETY			English	Review						Bioeconomy; Sustainability certification; Transnational hybrid governance; Territorialized resistance; Discourse coalitions	PRIVATE GOVERNANCE; PALM OIL; ROUND-TABLE; STANDARDS; POLITICS; VISIONS; SOVEREIGNTY; BUSINESS; BIOFUELS; POLICIES	The bioeconomy is nowadays widely proclaimed by governments and corporations around the world as a new paradigm for a sustainable economy. Essentially, it broadly denotes the promotion, development and establishment of the use of biogenic resources in diverse kinds of industrial technologies, production processes and products. Yet, in order for the bioeconomy to be sustainable, it has to be assured that these biogenic resources are sourced sustainably. In the last 30 years, transnational sustainability certification (TSC) has established itself as a popular instrument in this context, for example in the case of European biofuels sustainability regulation. In the last decade or so, however, TSC initiatives in several biomass production sectors like palm oil, soy, fruits, aquaculture or fisheries-mostly initiated by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and corporations from the Global North-are increasingly met with resistance from actors from the resource-producing countries, mostly located in the Global South. Issues brought up in this context concern their lack of legitimacy and respect for national regulatory sovereignty and conflicting priorities in terms of sustainable development. Consequently, governmental and corporate actors from the resource-producing countries have developed sustainability standards that now at least partly compete with TSC. Against this background, this contribution investigates this apparent dilemma of biomass certification by taking stock of existing TSC initiatives and territorial responses to them in several sectors of the bioeconomy in order to discover general patterns and dynamics of transnational biomass sustainability certification. This analysis is based on a review of existing empirical studies on these issues as well as on conceptual literature on discourse coalitions and transnational hybrid governance for the classification of the different aspects and developments in the individual sectors. Results show that TSC is indeed challenged in all sectors around story lines of sovereignty and sustainability, employed by closely associated state and industry actors in the specific context of the prevalent state-industry relations and the practices and institutions of the respective international political economies. Beyond this general pattern, these alternative systems take on different shapes and complex relations between transnational and territorial sustainability governance emerge that are not always antagonistic, but also exist in parallel or even complementarily and involve various hybrid configurations of public and private actors. Overall, this casts some doubt on the potential of TSC as an instrument to safeguard the sustainability of the bioeconomy and shows one of its potential pitfalls, which is reflected upon in the conclusion.

The Vi Agroforestry Program aims to implement agroforestry as a means to alleviate poverty and increase resilience among the poorest smallholders. After seven years, the Vi Agroforestry Project in the Mara Region of Tanzania had an inter-village variation in the proportion of households with tangible surviving agroforestry trees ranging from 10%-90%. Using a multiple methods approach, this variation was analysed in relation to changes and differences among administrative districts and project zones regarding perceived barriers to agroforestry adoption, project interventions, governance and the chronology of the process. In districts and zones where collaboration among the project staff, government counterparts and other stakeholders had been established at multiple levels, more agroforestry trees survived and a larger proportion of households practiced agroforestry. The established collaboration made it possible to discover and consider opportunities and barriers to agroforestry development such as diverse stakeholder interests and perceptions. As a result, potential conflicts could be avoided and socially robust solutions developed, adapted and integrated into the local subsistence systems.

It aims to assess the validity and reliability of a stakeholder framework appearing in previous studies. Design/methodology/approach The study uses a questionnaire survey and a cross-industry sample consisting of the largest firms in corporate Sweden. Multivariate analysis tests the stakeholder framework. Each of the 294 key informants was initially identified and contacted by telephone, generating a response rate of 36.5 per cent. Findings The tested stakeholder framework appears valid and reliable across countries to assess the internal stakeholders of focal firms, as well as their up- and downstream, market and societal stakeholders. This study provides additional empirical support to categorize firms' stakeholder considerations in sustainable business practices. Research limitations/implications This study validates previous findings in terms of Swedish firms' considerations of internal and external stakeholders in sustainable business practices in relation to one similar country (Norway) and one different country (Spain). The study also shows how the three countries perceive the focal company and societal stakeholders differently. Practical implications The tested framework sheds light on focal firms' stakeholder considerations in sustainable business practices and elucidates the extent to which firms' account for their internal and external stakeholders in sustainable business practices. Originality/value This study contributes to the development of valid and reliable stakeholder theory across contexts and through time. In particular, it contributes to the development of a valid and reliable framework to categorize firms' stakeholder considerations in sustainable business practices.	[Karlsson, Niklas P.

J	Tricallotis, M; Gunningham, N; Kanowski, P				Tricallotis, Marcos; Gunningham, Neil; Kanowski, Peter			The impacts of forest certification for Chilean forestry businesses	FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Certification impacts; CERTFOR; Chile; Forest governance; FSC	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; GOVERNANCE; FSC	Forest certification, under both the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and the PEFC-endorsed Chilean CERTFOR schemes, has been widely adopted in both the native and plantation forestry sectors in Chile. This study of the impacts of forest certification on Chilean forestry businesses is based in-depth interviews with 72 actors representing a diversity of roles and perspectives in the Chilean forestry sector. The impacts of certification have been greatest in the plantation forestry sector, and for larger businesses. These impacts include the cessation of deforestation for plantation establishment, rehabilitation of natural ecosystems, greater benefits to local communities, and the development of a positive dialogue between forestry businesses and their stakeholders. However, certification has not resolved some long-standing conflicts between forestry businesses and other actors, notably in relation to Indigenous peoples' land claims and workers' rights. Both certification schemes in Chile have promoted legal compliance; FSC certification is encouraging improvements beyond legal compliance, and deepening the changes initiated by CERTFOR. The results illustrate how certification can contribute to effective hybrid governance regimes, but also of the limits of certification in addressing deeply-entrenched social conflicts. Nevertheless, the impacts of certification for Chilean forestry businesses and their stakeholders have largely been positive.

Design/methodology/approach Using a panel of 408 Indian publicly listed companies for the period during 2010-2018, a fixed-effect panel threshold regression model is adapted to study the threshold effects between foreign ownership and firm value. Tobin's Q is used as a proxy for firm value. Findings The study identifies three threshold levels, that is, four threshold regions in which foreign ownership changes its slope considerably. Various firm characteristics impact firm value differently in these four regions. Research limitations/implications The study employs observations of the past nine years on variables identified as firm characteristics impacting firm value. Some variables are dropped due to the problem of multicollinearity. The employed variables may not be exhaustive in nature. Practical implications The present study implies that there exists no impact of foreign ownership on the value of the firm. Foreign investors invest for financial considerations and not with the objective of governing the firms. The governance effect of foreign investments is negligible, so their activism in the firms needs to be encouraged. Originality/value The study employs a novel approach to study the impact of foreign ownership on firm value applying fixed effect panel data threshold regression, considering foreign ownership as a proxy of corporate governance.

This paper explores the policy and practice of partnership working in a case study Category V area Northumberland National Park, England. Qualitative research was conducted through documentary analysis and semi-structured interviews with a sample of 23 stakeholders involved in the management of this protected area. It was found that a convoluted institutional history has shaped the present day approach to its management. The processes driving partnership working were understood in terms of governance factors with a relatively high degree of control and behavioural factors with a relatively low degree of control. There was a tacit acceptance among actors that success was dependent upon uncontrollable factors and in particular inter-personal relations between representatives of stakeholder bodies. These findings are important for all IUCN Category V protected areas reliant upon working within stakeholder partnerships to achieve sustainable development objectives. Management bodies can benefit from examining the history of these often complex webs of relationships and the implications for communications between organisations if they are to understand the processes that underpin this form of governance.

J	Bowen, KJ; Alexander, D; Miller, F; Dany, V				Bowen, Kathryn J.; Alexander, Damon; Miller, Fiona; Dany, Va			Using Social Network Analysis to Evaluate Health-Related Adaptation Decision-Making in Cambodia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						governance; climate change adaptation; global health; Cambodia; social network analysis	CLIMATE-CHANGE; GOVERNANCE; FRAMEWORK; BARRIERS; IMPACTS; SPREAD	Climate change adaptation in the health sector requires decisions across sectors, levels of government, and organisations. The networks that link these different institutions, and the relationships among people within these networks, are therefore critical influences on the nature of adaptive responses to climate change in the health sector. This study uses social network research to identify key organisational players engaged in developing health-related adaptation activities in Cambodia. It finds that strong partnerships are reported as developing across sectors and different types of organisations in relation to the health risks from climate change. Government ministries are influential organisations, whereas donors, development banks and non-government organisations do not appear to be as influential in the development of adaptation policy in the health sector. Finally, the study highlights the importance of informal partnerships (or 'shadow networks') in the context of climate change adaptation policy and activities. The health governance 'map' in relation to health and climate change adaptation that is developed in this paper is a novel way of identifying organisations that are perceived as key agents in the decision-making process, and it holds substantial benefits for both understanding and intervening in a broad range of climate change-related policy problems where collaboration is paramount for successful outcomes.

Through a comparative approach, some wineries from the Italian regions of Abruzzo and Tuscany have been surveyed and in-depth-interviews to key local stakeholders have been conducted. The aim of the survey is to investigate the companies' perception about wine tourists' characteristics and wine route management. Through a multivariate analysis, the reasons behind wineries' satisfaction/discontent have been analyzed. The findings identify a close relation between the complexity of the services offered, the companies' involvement in the wine routes management and their satisfaction about the results obtained. The more complex the services are, the more satisfied the companies. The comparative analysis of the strengths and weaknesses pointed out by the wineries' keepers has allowed some general considerations about the tools to use for the improvement of wine routes management. In a broader sense, the wineries' direct involvement both in investment and in governance appears to be key in the success of the routes as a model for local tourism development.

J	Siyambalapitiya, J; Zhang, X; Liu, XB				Siyambalapitiya, Janaka; Zhang, Xu; Liu, Xiaobing			Is Governmentality the Missing Link for Greening the Economic Growth?	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Review						green growth; circular economy; governmentality; environmental management; sustainable management; economic growth model; environmental sustainability	ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; CO2 EMISSIONS; GOVERNANCE	The new concept of "green growth" appears to be an economic growth model, which balances environment sustainability and fostering of economic growth. Yet, much of the green growth research has failed to address the real extent of interconnections and complexity of the relationship between governance and economic, social, and environmental structures. Furthermore, current green growth research tends to focus on the country level, such as the Millennium Development Goals and sustainable development indices, which risks ignoring the additional impacts on micro industrial economies. The lack of connection between green growth and good governanceknown as environmental governanceis a crucial gap in practical adoption. Therefore, this study uses Foucault's governmentality lens to view green growth as a technique of government, seeking an environmentally focused eco-governmentality. We examine the transformation, differential definitions, and critical dimensions of green growth in relation to particular case studies taken from China and South Korea and frame them for future sustainable studies. The findings of this study highlight the significant role of interdisciplinary research, as well both bottom-up and top-down initiatives, on enabling the transition to green growth. The proposed research framework and implementation strategy also identifies new avenues for future research and practices in the field of sustainable development, making it one of the study's key contributions to the literature.

J	Bailey, I; Caprotti, F				Bailey, Ian; Caprotti, Federico			The green economy: functional domains and theoretical directions of enquiry	ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE			English	Article						green economy; transition; sustainable development; ecological modernisation; postpolitical	EMERGING MARKETS; CARBON; SUSTAINABILITY; GEOGRAPHIES; TRANSITION; POLITICS; MATERIALITY; CIRCULATION; ENVIRONMENT; MANAGEMENT	The green economy is a highly complex construct in terms of its attempts to integrate economic, environmental, and social concerns, the wide range of actors involved, its material outcomes, and the forms of governance needed to regulate processes of economic greening. As such, it poses new empirical and theoretical challenges for social science research on socioenvironmental futures. This paper has two main aims. The first is to survey the emergent features and functional domains of the green economy. The second is to consider theoretical tools that might be used to analyse the drivers and processes shaping the green economy. Focusing on literature on sociotechnical transitions, ecological modernisation, the 'green' cultural economy, and postpolitical governance, we argue that understanding the functional and spatial heterogeneity of the green economy necessitates a multitheoretical approach. We then explore how combining branches of research on socioenvironmental governance can lead to theoretically and ontologically richer insights into the drivers, practices, and power relations within the green economy. In so doing, we respond to calls for socioeconomic research on environmental change which is neither just empirical nor bound to one theoretical outlook to the detriment of understanding the complexity of socioenvironmental governance and human-nature relations.

Western Experience in Strategic Planning for National Security	MGIMO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS			Russian	Article						strategic planning; goal setting; sustainable development; governance; modeling and forecasting; strategic priorities		The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the best Western practices in strategic planning with the view to improve the effectiveness of the Russian Federation national security policy in the face of new challenges and threats. Having analyzed Western approaches to ensuring national security, the article concludes that the political and governance practice needs to include more of strategic planning elements, such as strategic forecasting, monitoring, and national security assessment. Based on applicability to the Russian environment, the article particularly focuses on the American experience in strategic planning and discusses the origins and nature of the ideologeme of Americentrism that has dominated the American politics since 1990s. The author reveals how important role the use of soft power in specific national interests plays in the government policy for national security purposes and concludes that interrelation and mutual influence between planning and governance are indispensable.

Moreover the existence of interest approach would lead for international environmental collaborations by promoting the precautionary principle, subsequently influence in the early negotiations of creating MEAs, which include the Montreal Protocol. The Montreal Protocol has managed to seek international environmental collaboration among almost all of the nations in the world, which made the Montreal Protocol become a successful one. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study was to explain the influence of interest approach that promotes the precautionary principle in the international environmental governance and law on regards of the Montreal Protocol's early negotiations and the relations of the interstates participation response. Meanwhile, the methods of this study are based on qualitative set up, which is based on the meetings' proceeding reports of the Montreal Protocol. Finally, the results potentially provide with better understanding of the influence of interest approach in promoting the precautionary principle in order to lead for further development and expansion of the rules on international environmental governance and law for achieving the global environmental protection goals.

J	Jacob, C; Dupras, J				Jacob, Celine; Dupras, Jerome			Institutional bricolage and the application of the No Net Loss policy in Quebec: can we really engender 'social fit' for more sustainable land use planning?	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY & PLANNING			English	Article						Biodiversity offset; water resource management; land use planning; institutions	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE; BIODIVERSITY; KNOWLEDGE; RESOURCE; SCIENCE	Offsetting and, more broadly speaking, the mitigation hierarchy have been widely studied in terms of decreasing the impacts of economic activities on biodiversity. There has been considerable tendency to anchor these mechanisms in science, promoting the idea that they are scientifically constructed. Building on Quebec's recent regulatory changes concerning the introduction of offsetting and the mitigation hierarchy for wetlands and streams, we argue that their implementation relies strongly on political and social constructs. Using institutional bricolage, we highlight the implication of power relations, dominant views and path dependency in this new institutional setting. Indeed, the No Net Loss principle seems to raise historical tensions in water management policies, especially those between strong centralized governance and fragmented territorial management. But No Net Loss application also confronts powerful traditional land use planning with a long history of promoting development interests. To overcome these tensions, No Net Loss can be viewed as an opportunity for innovation towards more sustainable land use planning that acknowledges collective values. To investigate the potential for a novel social fit for wetland offsetting, we call upon Actor-Network Theory to rethink land use planning for a collective vision of the territory.

J	De Martino, P				De Martino, Paolo			Defending the past by challenging the future: spatial and institutional path dependencies in the Naples port-city region	REGIONAL STUDIES REGIONAL SCIENCE			English	Article						port cities; path dependence; historical institutionalism; institutional inertia; regionalisation; European Commission; Naples; governance	GOVERNANCE REFORMS; MANAGEMENT; ECONOMICS; POLICY	Historical paths matter in port-city regions. Here, spatial patterns and governance arrangements are path dependent to the point that once certain paths have been established, these become hard to change. This defines a condition of institutional inertia that plays a significant role in preventing any form of spatial change. Naples is an exemplar of how different actors have historically developed their own routines and planning tools, resulting in the spatial and governance separation still visible today. How do path dependencies influence the port-city (and regional) relationship we are experiencing today? Nowadays, ports operate in an increasingly changing environment where spatial and economic developments can be better understood as the results of actors' interactions across different scales. In order to cope with global urgencies, such as energy, economic and societal transition, European infrastructure policies are driving many port authorities towards infrastructural integration and governance cooperation. This offers significant opportunities to improve relations among ports, but it mostly leaves out the interconnections with cities and larger regions. Moreover, it also challenges consolidated beliefs and planning cultures which have planned ports and cities as disconnected entities, at least since industrialization. In Naples, local and national authorities find it difficult to define a sustainable consistency of interests. Today, the Central Tyrrhenian seaport system is the new institutional umbrella overseeing the three main ports of the region: Naples, Castellammare di Stabia and Salerno. This paper investigates whether this new governance entity results in either an opportunity for change or a reinforcement of existing path dependencies.

The alpine pasture was pronounced an area of shared challenges in terms of climate change, involving the co-responsibility of livestock farmers and the Park. It was also seen as an ideal area for observation and intervention based on cooperation. The ideas put forward led to the creation of the Sentinel Alpine Pastures programme. The ultimate aim of this programme is to anticipate the impact of climate events in order to ensure sustainable alpine pasture management. Studying modes of adaptation to events is part of a long-term approach to address the complex dynamics of climate change. We show how this approach, the information collection protocols and the data capitalization methods implemented aim to meet the requirements stemming from this current issue: involvement of all actors (livestock farmers and herdsmen, farming technicians, pastoral systems specialists, researchers and managers of protected areas), collective learning based on shared observations, and integration of an alpine pasture farms system. The programme works as a tool providing help with analysis and decision-making in relation to processes involving the climate, the environment, pastoral practices and livestock farming systems. The work collectives implementing it are also paving the way for new forms of governance in terms of the relations between pastoralism and local area stakeholders.

J	Siri, M; Zhu, SS				Siri, Michele; Zhu, Shanshan			Will the EU Commission Successfully Integrate Sustainability Risks and Factors in the Investor Protection Regime? A Research Agenda	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						sustainable finance; investor protection regulation; ESG investing; EU law; non-financial reporting	CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; BEHAVIOR; GENDER	Building a common EU framework for sustainable finance undoubtedly implies the integration of sound and sustainable processes and skills across the whole structure and governance of financial institutions. Consequently, a new financial paradigm is going to be needed, which will require the strengthening of investor care and protection, so contributing to the restoration of trust in the financial sector. In particular, on 18 December 2018, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) launched two public consultations on draft technical advice for the integration of sustainability risks and factors into the Directive on Markets in Financial Instruments (MiFID), the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD), and the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive (UCITS) regimes, with the aim to clarify the so-called fiduciary duties and to increase transparency in the financial services industry. However, the success of the EU initiatives on investor protection regulation may be seriously endangered by the existence of many challenges, weaknesses, and contradictions raised by economists and stakeholders in relation to the definition of sustainability, ESG data availability and reliability, the development of an EU taxonomy, conflicts of interest, product governance, and suitability assessment. This paper starts by briefly analyzing the recent developments of the regulation of sustainable finance at the global level, then offers a more detailed view on the establishment of a common regime on sustainable finance in the EU, with particular reference to the action plan 'Financing Sustainable Growth'. Then, it examines the recent proposals for regulation on sustainable finance, specifically considering the barriers to the integration of sustainability risks and factors in the EU investor protection regulation-with particular reference to investment services-with respect to its four main dimensions: (1) disclosure of product information, (2) conduct of business (COB) rules, (3) product governance and intervention, and (4) financial education. The paper concludes that the EU reforming proposals, though admirable, risk oversimplifying a complex issue that cannot be easily solved without considering its practical implications on each category of financial operators in the performance of different financial services.

We conducted long-term action research in the Virola-Jatoba ' Sustainable Development Project (PDS), where peasant farmers who were the early settlers of the area, and more recent occupants allied to illegal loggers, land grabbers and speculators adopt antagonistic positions and challenge respective entitlements towards land and forest. In this research we highlight issues of power asymmetry and social injustice when assessing how social relations and environmental conditions in the study area are affected by land use and forest conservation policies since year 2000, when the scheme was established. The PDS situation approached a collapse in late 2017 when the integrity of its forests and the beliefs and practices of vulnerable local residents were damaged. This case study empirically demonstrates that Amazon forest frontier systems have a limited capacity to endure extreme perturbations in the social and ecological interconnected domains. We argue that when a threshold is reached in systems featuring heavily institutionalized social asymmetries that constrain the action of vulnerable resource users, few conditions remain to reorganize the constituent setup through adaptive changes in the same regime or state. Reaching this stage will likely result in drastic changes that will lock the system into a pathway that compromises human wellbeing and the provision of ecosystem services. The fundamental nature of a tenurial scheme that combines social justice and environmental conservation tends thus to be lost for good, to enter a new regime with fewer options and novelties in social ecological advances, reflecting the overall setbacks currently experienced in Brazilian policy.

We report the findings of a preliminary desktop review of environmental, social and governance reporting by 35 of the most prominent RI funds managers in Australia. Only one RI fund had a comprehensive policy in relation to food system themes and 16 did not specifically mention the environmental, social and governance issues raised by food systems at all. Some addressed labour rights and intensive animal agriculture issues in the food system, and a few mentioned the climate change, biodiversity loss and water impacts of food. We conclude that a more comprehensive and holistic approach to consideration of sustainable food systems in RI is required to meet the goals set by the Paris Agreement, Sustainable Development Goals and other environmental and human rights frameworks.

Existing transboundary mechanism such as the Mekong River Commission (MRC) is challenged to facilitate the cooperation between riparian states. An epistemic community (EC) is considered to effectively influence international governance and is studied as part of transboundary river regimes. The existence of an MRC EC is part of that regime but understanding about its characteristics is yet limited. This research aims to fill in the gap by unraveling the main features of the EC in relation to hydropower development. We analyze shared causal beliefs and policy goals that developed in the EC framework of Haas applying literature review and semi-structured interviews of experts. Results show that the community experts share causal beliefs and policy goals only to a limited extent while disagreeing on many aspects. It resembles a "disciplined" or "professional" group rather than an EC. This suggests that the knowledge factor has not gained proper influence and attention in the region, resulting in incoherent policy advice leading to policymakers developing policies based on incomplete and fragmented knowledge. The role of the MRC in the decision-making process could become more relevant if it would facilitate the development of an EC. Bringing key stakeholders including policymakers and experts into a platform where policy goals and causal beliefs are facilitated to reach possible consensus is recommended. Narrowing the science-policy gap while acknowledging differences in interests and policy objectives is crucial to reach a sustainable transboundary management of the Mekong River given its rapid development, especially on hydropower.

J	Stephen, K				Stephen, Kathrin			Societal Impacts of a Rapidly Changing Arctic	CURRENT CLIMATE CHANGE REPORTS			English	Article						Arctic; Impacts; Society; Climate change; Globalisation; Oil and gas; Shipping; Fisheries; Tourism; Agriculture; Tourism; Community viability; Power relations; Indigenous peoples; Sustainable development; Sustainability; Global Arctic	SOCIAL LICENSE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INDIGENOUS PEOPLES; SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE; CRUISE TOURISM; OIL; URBANIZATION; GOVERNANCE; OPERATE; NORTH	This review article makes six observations about the current body of research on the societal impacts of a changing Arctic. First, climate change and globalisation are the dominant drivers of societal impacts in the Arctic. Second, many contributions focus on the impacts in concrete sectors of society, often from an opportunities-and-risks perspective, which tends to blur the boundary to more policy-oriented work. Third, the mantra of the sustainable development of the Arctic or Arctic sustainability pervades considerations ofArctic societal impacts. Fourth, societal and environment change in the Arctic is increasingly analysed using the image of the Global Arctic, highlighting the inextricable linkages between Arctic and global processes and systems and thus the entangled fate of the North and the entire globe. Fifth, an increasing number of actors is seen as being involved in societal and environmental transformations in the Arctic, often conveyed through the (often ill-defined) stakeholder concept. Sixth, Arctic indigenous peoples are depicted as the group most vulnerable to the societal impacts of a changing Arctic, but are increasingly the subject of research in the form of rights-holders and active participants in governance, law, politics, and research. Challenges for future research include achieving greater clarity and reflexivity around key concepts, and de-essentialising the Arctic via the use of comparative methods on cases both within and beyond the Arctic.

Therefore, this article provides an overview on the challenges and perspectives of food systems in the Mediterranean. In particular, the paper addresses the main challenges (environmental, economic, socio-cultural and nutrition-health) facing Mediterranean food systems; analyses the multifaceted relations between sustainable food systems (SFS) and sustainable diets by exploring the example of the Mediterranean diet; and briefly presents the relevance of the innovation for Mediterranean food systems. The paper highlights the urgency of action to move towards sustainable and resilient food systems in the Mediterranean area. This is particularly relevant in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. For that, there is a need for shared policy, governance, practice and research agenda. In this respect, the contribution of CIHEAM results fundamental. The paper concludes by highlighting the disruptive potential of the SFS-Med Platform - under co-development by CIHEAM, FAO and the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) - to foster food systems transformation towards sustainability and accelerate the achievement of SDGs in the region.

This study is the first analysis of Latvian experience of public spending reviews in 2016 2019, characterises present patterns and proposes changes for future spending reviews. In general, the Ministry of Finance is conducting public spending review as quite technocratic exercises - an opportunity to make sure that existing public institutions' budgets are being spent as efficiently as possible and conduct decision making on the civil service level. However, involvement of political level is a possibility to ensure that public spending objectives are met and the allocation of public resources reflects policy goals. The main task of the paper is to analyse the Latvian experience of regular public spending reviews and generalize recommendations for other countries and future development of the spending reviews. It can be concluded that increasing prioritisation of budgetary spending and its relation with economic development can be supported by spending reviews as a mechanism to increase government spending in priority policy areas and to ensure reallocation of resources for underfinanced budget programmes through improvement of the efficiency of expenditures. Recommendations on improvement of the spending review process and possible changes to the budget law legislation are worked out.

In this chapter, we demonstrate how the principles of citizen science-the intrinsic involvement of nonscientist local stakeholders throughout the entire life cycle of a project-have the potential to complement and benefit those of IWRM; in particular, in relation to creating scientific evidence that underpins the governance of water resources. The rapid, recent development of information and communication technologies such as the Internet, smartphones, and social media has already demonstrated their capacity to make knowledge creation and governance more multidirectional, decentralized, diverse, and inclusive. We show how such new technologies can be harnessed with a citizen science approach to interrogate different aspects of the water cycle. One particularly promising development is to support citizen science with robust and low-cost sensor and networking technology. Such networks offer not only improved data coverage (especially in remote or data-scarce regions) but also enhanced sustainability at a time when monitoring networks are in decline globally. We argue that, in certain cases, citizen science and polycentric governance approaches can enrich and complement IWRM and merit greater attention.

J	Petersson, MT; Dellmuth, LM; Merrie, A; Osterblom, H				Petersson, Matilda Tove; Dellmuth, Lisa Maria; Merrie, Andrew; Osterblom, Henrik			Patterns and trends in non-state actor participation in regional fisheries management organizations	MARINE POLICY			English	Article						Global fisheries governance; Non-state actors; Population ecology; Tuna regional fisheries management organizations	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE; RIGHTS-BASED MANAGEMENT; OCEAN TUNA FISHERY; ADVOCACY; POLITICS; ECOLOGY; WESTERN; NGOS	Non-state actors (NSAs) have proliferated in number and are increasingly acknowledged to matter for global governance of natural resources. This has generated considerable scholarly interest, but there is surprisingly little systematic knowledge about patterns and trends of NSA participation in global fisheries institutions. This article addresses this gap by studying NSA populations, considering more than 500 actors attending commission meetings, in the five tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (tuna RFMOs) between 2004 and 2011. It constructs a theoretical framework drawing on previous insights from population ecology and global governance literature. The articles finds that multiple NSAs participate in tuna RFMOs, but there is no general trend towards increasing proportions of NSAs compared to state participants. Representational diversity was found to be relatively limited, as NSA participants were predominately representing industry interests and from high income countries. Volatility of NSAs varied across RFMOs, but it was clear that industry representatives were frequently repeat participants, while civil society organizations (CSOs) participated only in occasional meetings. Finally, industry representatives were found to participate as part of member state delegations, while CSOs generally participated as observers. The article discusses the implications of the variation in NSA populations across RFMOs, and over time, and in relation to important concerns in the broader scholarly debates on access, influence, representation, and effectiveness in global environmental governance.

Employing a green governmentality lens, we analyze the debate surrounding one controversial dam in Laos, the Xayaburi. In the realm of hydropower development in the Mekong, a green governmentality approach allows for both an investigation of the macro-political influences on hydropower development, including trade liberalization and regional economic development, and the micro-political disciplining of state and non-state actors who, through legitimizing particular discourses and practices, reinforce global power relations. Our findings suggest that World Bank-style sustainable development discourses continue to shape ideas and practices relating to hydropower and sustainable development in Laos. However, we conclude that green neoliberalization does not fully explain how the Lao state is operating and that more attention to its practices as an authoritarian state is needed. This case moves the study of green governmentality forward by examining how green neoliberalization operates in a variegated, late-neoliberal world.

Data from China's Huainan mining area were collected through a questionnaire survey and statistically analyzed through a structural equation model and a resistance diagnosis. Results showed that the relative importance of behavior perception (0.457), behavior attitude (0.332), and behavior norms (0.231) to the mining area ecological protection decreases successively for mining area residents. Further, the dominant influencing factors of economic benefits and neighborhood ethic pressure are identical, except for the observed variables of behavior perception, and there is a difference between the second and the third observed variables in relation to behavior attitude. Finally, it was also found that the causal chain path coefficient of groups with no willingness to pay was greater than that of the others. The findings of this study can help understand the impacts between the behavior cognition of mining area ecological protection and ecological protection, as well as the impact of mining area resident behavior willingness on the causal chain. Further, ecological protection knowledge production based on these are beneficial to achieve ecological security and sustainable development of mining areas. To improve knowledge productions, it is recommended to introduce the concept of 'co-construction, co-governance, and sharing' into the production system, devising new means of precise data gathering interventions, and optimizing a new path of value realization.

J	Schmidt, JJ				Schmidt, Jeremy J.			Of kin and system: Rights of nature and the UN search for Earth jurisprudence	TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF BRITISH GEOGRAPHERS			English	Article						Earth jurisprudence; governance; kin; rights of nature; system	LAW; POLITICS; SCIENCE; ONTOLOGIES	Since 2009, the United Nations programme on Harmony with Nature has sought a new philosophy of global environmental governance known as Earth jurisprudence. This paper examines how Harmony with Nature has advanced Earth jurisprudence to unite Indigenous legal traditions, rights of nature, and mounting evidence from Earth system science regarding anthropogenic forcing on the planet. It does so through a policy analysis of annual UN reports, resolutions, and dialogues with international experts. Situating Harmony with Nature in the broader intellectual heritage of Earth jurisprudence and contemporary efforts to address anthropogenic forcing on the Earth system in the Anthropocene, I argue that Harmony with Nature operates at the juncture of two powerful ways of ordering relations, knowledge, and obligation: kin and system. The critical analysis shows how a new geography of global environmental governance has been produced within the constraints of the UN precisely by scaling Indigenous kinship to the planetary diagnoses made by system-based planetary sciences. The resulting form of Earth jurisprudence in Harmony with Nature holds important, cautionary lessons both for understanding how Indigenous legal traditions are made to comport with UN sustainable development programmes and for contemporary efforts to transform governance to meet the pressing demands of global environmental change.

Design/methodology/approach A data driven approach has been conducted. The collection of the peoples' opinions has been realized on two specific social network communities as follows: Twitter and Instagram. The text mining processes carried out a sentiment and a cluster analysis. Findings The sentiment analysis of the most frequent words has been shown. The following four main homogeneous categories of words are emerged in relation to the decommissioning of offshore platforms: technological areas, green governance (GG), circular economy and socio-economic sphere. Research limitations/implications The alternative use of the offshore platforms, including tourism initiatives, aquaculture, alternative energy generation, hydrogen storage and environmental research, could improve the resilience of communities by offering the development of new jobs and the growth of local and innovative green businesses. Practical implications The adoption of a circular model and GG initiatives aims to limit the input of resources and energy, minimize waste and losses, adopt a sustainable approach and realize new social and territorial value. Originality/value The analysis underlines the importance to adopt a systems perspective, which takes into account the social, economic and environmental system as a whole, the different phenomena that occur and the variety of categories of stakeholders, from users to local governments that participate in the territorial development.

The chapter highlights three dimensions which characterize the paradigm shift; namely, discourse on norms, diversifying actors, and the changed mode of communication and participation in the global consultation processes. The existing formal structure of the EFA global governance is based on multilateralism which recognizes sovereign nation-states, representing national interests, as the participants. However, such an assumption is eroding, given that there is a growing number of state and nonstate actors who influence decision-making not only through conventional formal channels, but also informally. Urging the revision of theories of multilateralism, the chapter introduces the attention given to nontraditional donors and horizontal networks of civil society actors in this volume. The introduction also shows that that the widening basis of participation in the global consultation processes on post-EFA and advanced communication technology have changed the ways in which discourse is formulated. While the amount and the speed of exchanging information have been enhanced and different types of actors have been encouraged to take part, it also obliges scholars to adopt innovative methods of analyzing discourse formation. The chapter also demonstrates the importance of the focus on the Asia-Pacific region, which is composed of diverse actors who often underscore Asian cultural roots in contrast to Western hegemony. By focusing on the discourse, actors, and the structure through which the consensus views on the post-EFA agenda were built, the volume attempts to untangle the nature of the post-EFA paradigm shift, at the global, Asia-Pacific regional, and national levels.

Fisheries co-management in a new era of marine policy in the UK: A preliminary assessment of stakeholder perceptions	MARINE POLICY			English	Article						Inshore Fisheries and Conservation; Authorities; Sustainable development	MANAGEMENT; PRINCIPLES; RESILIENCE; GOVERNANCE	Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authorities (IFCAs) were established in England after the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 became operational in April 2011. The IFCAs represent a co-management system which prioritises both conservation and fisheries objectives and broadens the interest groups involved in regulatory decision-making in inshore fisheries. The establishment of the IFCAs is intended to facilitate a true ecosystem approach to marine management, contribute to a more contemporary, open and inclusive governance model and move towards the ultimate goal of sustainable fisheries. The aim of this paper is to give a preliminary assessment of the perceptions of IFCA members of their role in relation to a number of IFCA criteria. Forty IFCA members responded to an online questionnaire. Four IFCA Chief Officers then commented on members' views in a second questionnaire. Findings suggest that despite the diversity of views of members the IFCA goals are commonly agreed. 'Conservation of marine ecosystems for (direct) economic purposes' and 'Sustaining and improving fisheries productivity' are given as the top two priorities receiving 77.5% and 67.5% of the possible vote respectively. 'Ensuring effective fisheries enforcement' and 'conservation of marine ecosystems for non-economic purposes' followed jointly receiving 47.5% of possible vote. There is a wide concern amongst members, however, that the resources of the IFCA are inadequate to meet all goals. Managing members' expectations will be essential in early years of the IFCAs in order that realistic management objectives can be met. Members identified a need for improved communication and education regarding both fisheries and environmental issues to ensure better informed decision making. IFCAs appear to have many of the attributes needed for successful co-management though continued monitoring of IFCA performance is required. The paper reflects on the wider global context, noting that improving fisheries sustainability to any significant degree requires concerted effort in regional policy making. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

No work has yet undertaken how this development led to novel, not experienced before, systems structure in marine SES. Here, we quantify socio-economic novelty as the degree of dissimilarity relative to a specific spatiotemporal baseline in the Baltic Sea fisheries SES between 1975 and 2015. We used catch by "gears," catch by "commercial groups" and trade ("import" and "export") as respective indicators of novelty at national, regional and international governance levels. We found that socio-economic novelty increased over time nonlinearly in relation to the 1975-1979 baseline. The contribution to total novelty shifted from the dominance of "gears" and "commercial groups" in the late 1990s and early 2000s to "import" and "export" after the mid-2000s, i.e. from national and regional levels to the international level. The fastest increase in novelty occurred with the trade dominance shift, primarily related to monetary value rather than quantity. Spatially, novelty emerged with a large difference across countries, and a major contribution by Sweden, Denmark and Poland. We identified the influence of different management interventions and governance actions on the emergence of novelty in the Baltic SES. The decreasing socio-economic novelty at national and regional levels could indicate reduced variability due to management intervention in recent years which might decrease SES resilience to shocks. Calculating socio-economic novelty and studying its drivers at different scales could provide a better understanding of SES complexity and inform urgently needed adaptation and transformation towards sustainable future pathways.

However, in 2020, only 70 percent of this area remained forested. The government has consistently undertaken corrective actions to achieve Sustainable Development Goal targets, with a special focus on Goals #1 (no poverty), #2 (zero hunger), #3 (good health and well-being), #7 (affordable and clean energy), #8 (decent work and economic growth), #13 (climate action), and #15 (life on land). Good environmental governance is a core concept in Indonesia's forest management and includes mainstreaming ecosystem services as a framework for sustainable forest management. This paper analyzes efforts to mainstream Indonesia's remaining forest ecosystem services. We review the state of Indonesia's forests in relation to deforestation dynamics, climate change, and ecosystem service potential and options and provide recommendations for mainstreaming strategies regarding aspects of policy, planning, and implementation, as well as the process of the articulation of ecosystem services and their alternative funding.

Land-sea systems are examples of complex systems including interfaces that can be perceived as boundaries, overlooking connections of the whole system. We explored the occurrence of several features of scientific knowledge building and governance of these systems that can hinder the recognition of connectivity, challenging an ES approach. We analyzed online survey responses from academics representing 22 research institutions and 13 case studies, all from Latin America. Results showed that the generation of scientific knowledge is not integrally approached and there are deficiencies in researchers' communication with stakeholders across the land-sea interface. These drawbacks in scientific knowledge building could be one of the reasons why an ES approach is rarely applied on governance of land-sea systems. The cases showed segmented governance schemes and that conflict situations enhance the visibility of ecosystem relations. The establishment of long-lasting institutional instruments and the involvement of intermediaries connecting sectors are complementary paths to improve integrated governance. Using ES as a boundary concept could improve integration between sectors and ES trade-off analysis can help to introduce ecosystem relations to stakeholders related to their own interests.

J	Liu, L				Liu, Lee			Sustainability efforts in China: Reflections on the environmental Kuznets curve through a locational evaluation of "Eco-Communities"	ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS			English	Review						environment-development; environmental Kuznets curve (EKC); nature-society; sustainability science; sustainable development	ECONOMIC-GROWTH; ECOLOGICAL AGRICULTURE; TRANSITION; SCIENCE; TRENDS; DEFORESTATION; GLOBALIZATION; VULNERABILITY; CONSERVATION; GEOGRAPHIES	In contrast to the common dismal view of China's environment, this article highlights local and national sustainability efforts in China and examines the location characteristics of China's Eco-Communities (Shengtai Qu), communities that achieved significant sustainability per the evaluation of the Chinese government. It explores what the Chinese experience implies to the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) concept in the context of nature-society relations and sustainability studies. The research was based on field research in eight Chinese provinces in 2001, 2004, and 2006, in addition to Chinese governmental and academic sources. At the national level, there appeared to be a positive environment-development relationship: The Eco-Communities tended to concentrate in more developed eastern China. The Eco-Communities displayed unique spatial patterns that are strikingly at odds with conventional wisdom, however. They were often found in the periphery of their provinces away from the wealthiest areas, poorer and smaller in economy and population compared to other communities in the provinces. Contrary to the EKC, the findings illustrate that communities can achieve environmental improvement along with economic growth, thus a win-win, nature-society relationship, at early stages of development. Natural resource endowments and environmental governance appear to be more important than development level in determining an area's sustainabitity. Environment-development research should move beyond the traditional EKC debate to better understand nature-society relations and sustainability.

Fossil fuels, particularly crude oil, are confined to a few regions of the world while the continuity of supply is governed by dynamic political, economic, and ecological factors. Cities and urban systems are largely dependent on local and imported resources in support of both quantitative and qualitative growth. However, modern cities are experiencing shortages of energy, water, clean air, social relations and cohesion, social inclusion, and ultimately lack of participatory governance of city complexity. At present about 50% of the world population (i.e., about 3.5 billion people) live in cities. The resource basis seems to be insufficient and unfairly distributed to support an acceptable standard of living for a large fraction of urban and rural population. In addition, the concentration of resources required to support cities places a huge load on surrounding environment. For these reasons, cities must face the challenge of reorganizing their infrastructures and lifestyles to cope with the decreasing availability of resources. The priority in policy making is to identify suitable policies to reorganize urban life in the presence of a shrinking resource basis. Such reorganization will have to make cities less energy and material demanding, although still providing high quality standards of life. This cannot occur without investments, research, and important and shared choices about lifestyles. 2016 L&H Scientific Publishing, LLC. All rights reserved.

Organising for mutual advantage: Municipal associations in Bulgaria	PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Local Government Support Organisations - What have We Learned	SEP   22, 2004	Sofia, BULGARIA			local government; municipal associations; institutional development; Bulgaria; Eastern Europe		Networks of local government support organisations (LGSOs) are critical to successful intergovernmental relations and effective local governance in democratic societies. Bulgaria had no such network of municipal associations when it began the transition from communist rule in the early 1990s. Using US and other external technical assistance, Bulgaria over the next decade overcame the impediments to collective action and established what appears to be an effective and sustainable system to back up its cities and towns. Important factors in mobilising support included a long-term focus on institutional development, non-partisanship, flexibility in implementation and a pragmatic orientation that focused on learning by doing.

It is linked to the fact that decentralization leads to optimization of public functions and facilitates a more rational model of inter-budget relations that ensure the sustainable operation on all levels of state institutions. We should admit that in Kazakhstan movement towards decentralization goes by leaps and bounds. The objective necessity of deep analysis of the processes currently taking place in the Kazakhstan public administration system is determined, in the first place, by consideration of possible implications. The significance of this issue rises from the key provisions of "The Strategy "Kazakhstan -2050" The new political course of the newly established state" which underline the need to thoroughly realize the policy of decentralization of the state governance. Along with this, it emphasizes that "the essence of the idea of decentralization lays in providing rights and required resources in order to shift the responsibility of decision-making from the center to regional authority bodies". Besides the major goal - to attract the population to solving issues around public governance - decentralization pursues as well the goal of increasing the living standards and enhancing potential development of some components of public community systems, particularly, on the scale of regions. We need to note that in the period of purposeful work by the Kazakhstan government on development of the territory, residents of peripheral regions distanced from the capital obtain tangible results from such a work. Current economic successes of Kazakhstan induce the importance of decentralization. This process is carried out together with other transformations, such as social, institutional, political, public ones. However, M.Kenzheguzin, a Kazakhstan expert, warns that "decentralization of the state governance is a complex and therefore lengthy and permanent process the deadlines of which cannot be clearly defined and arranged ". It is obvious that the modern world cannot produce one single model of state power decentralization as well as single forms and methods of its realization. The system of political decisions can be considered decentralized if a local unit "can impose its taxes and provide a set of services in accordance with preferences of its residents". At the moment, Kazakhstan has not reached this stage yet, however a number of measures done in this direction are worth mentioning. For instance, "The Concept of Local Self-Governance Development in Kazakhstan" was adopted in 2012 which will contribute to strengthening local public administration and streamlining administrative reforms in the regions. Another major political event concerning the issue under consideration was the election of 92 per cents of regional Akims which took place in 2013.											5	2	2	0	2	STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD	SOFIA	1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA	2367-5659		978-619-7105-25-4	INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI			2014							89	96						8	Law; Political Science	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)	Government & Law	BD3FS					2022-12-14	WOS:000359614500013

Delivering sustainable urban water management: a review of the hurdles we face	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						barrier typology; capacity building; institutional change; socio-institutional impediments	RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; IMPLEMENTATION; ARRANGEMENTS; IMPEDIMENTS; BARRIERS; DRAINAGE; NEED	Sustainable urban water management (SUWM) requires an integrated, adaptive, coordinated and participatory approach. Current urban water policies are beginning to reflect this understanding yet the rhetoric is often not translated to implementation. Despite the 'new' philosophy, urban water management remains a complex and fragmented area relying on traditional, technical, linear management approaches. Despite widespread acknowledgement of the barriers to change, there has been little systematic review of what constitutes the scope of such barriers and how these should be addressed to advance SUWM. To better understand why implementation fails to occur beyond ad hoc project interventions, an extensive literature review of observed and studied barriers was conducted. Drawing on local, national and international literature from the field of integrated urban water management and other similar fields, 53 studies were assessed, resulting in a typology of 12 barrier types. The analysis revealed the barriers are largely socio-institutional rather than technical, reflecting issues related to community, resources, responsibility, knowledge, vision, commitment and coordination. Furthermore, the meta-analysis demonstrated a paucity of targeted strategies for overcoming the stated institutional barriers. Evaluation of the typology in relation to capacity building suggests that these systemic issues require a sophisticated programme of change that focuses on fostering social capital, intersectoral professional development, and inter-organisational coordination.

Addressing these challenges requires innovative landscape scale farming systems that account for changing economic and environmental targets. These novel agricultural systems need to be recognized, accepted and promoted by all stakeholders, including local residents, and supported by public policies. Agroecosystems should be considered as socio-ecological systems and alternative farming systems should be based on ecological principles while taking societal needs into account. This requires an in-depth knowledge of the multiple interactions between sociological and ecological dynamics. Long Term Socio-Ecological Research platforms (LTSER) are ideal for acquiring this knowledge as they (i) are not constrained by traditional disciplinary boundaries, (ii) operate at a large spatial scale involving all stakeholders, and (iii) use systemic approaches to investigate biodiversity and ecosystem services. This study presents the socio-ecological research strategy from the LTSER "Zone Atelier Plaine & Val de Sevre" (ZA PVS), a large study area where data has been sampled since 1994. Its global aim is to identify effective solutions for agricultural development and the conservation of biodiversity in farmlands. Three main objectives are targeted by the ZAPVS. The first objective is intensive monitoring of landscape features, the main taxa present and agricultural practices. The second objective is the experimental investigation, in real fields with local farmers, of important ecosystem functions and services, in relation to pesticide use, crop production and farming socio-economic value. The third aimis to involve stakeholders through participatory research, citizen science and the dissemination of scientific results. This paper underlines the relevance of LTSERs for addressing agricultural challenges, while acknowledging that there are some yet unsolved key challenges. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

If, on the one hand, the specialization of science has produced higher levels of knowledge, on the other hand, the whole picture of the complex interactions between systems has suffered. Economic and natural sciences are, on matters of sustainable development, strongly divergent, and the interface informing decision-making is weak. This downplays uncertainty and creates room for entrenched political positions, compromising evidence-based decision-making and putting the urgent need to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of Agenda 2030 at risk. This article presents the heterodox Eco-GAME framework for interconnecting science through trans-disciplinary social-learning and meta-evaluation of scientific knowledge in pursuit of SDGs. The framework is tested and refined in the BONUS MARES project by systematic literature analysis, participatory workshops, and semi-structured interviews, in relation to the specific habitats of Baltic Sea mussel reefs, seagrass beds and macroalgae ecosystem services produced and methods applied. The results, acknowledging the urgency of interfacing science, policy and society, validate the Eco-GAME as a framework for this purpose and present a multi-dimensional system of indicators as a further development.

J	Momen, MS				Momen, Md Saiful			Synergistic rural-urban development The experience of the Rural-Urban Partnership Programme (RUPP) in Nepal	INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLANNING REVIEW			English	Article							HOUSEHOLD INCOME DIVERSIFICATION; SMALL-TOWN; MARKET; POLICY	The discovery and greater understanding of what have come to be known as 'rural-urban linkages' calls for a more radical change in development planning than policies inspired by the sustainable livelihoods approach or by the uncritical desire of 'strengthening' linkages allow. The rebirth of interest in rural development in the late 1990s offers an opportunity to bring to prominence more comprehensive frameworks for such planning. This article starts from the position that rural development needs to be regionalised, and that poverty alleviation is dependent on the retention of the multiplier effect in the local economy, and the redressing of exploitative socio-spatial relations. The overarching model and the experience of the Rural-Urban Partnership Programme in a Nepalese municipality are recounted here, with special focus on the micro-enterprise component. Major lessons include the importance of getting the nuts and bolts of practice right even when the underlying model appears coherent. RUPP experience also appears to highlight the importance of localising much of the value-added chain of local resource-based commodities in the rural region. The coordinated governance of villages and towns appears to be essential too.

J	Owen, JR; Kemp, D				Owen, John R.; Kemp, Deanna			Social licence and mining: A critical perspective	RESOURCES POLICY			English	Article						Social licence; Mining; Sustainable development; Corporate social responsibility; Stakeholder; Engagement	COMMUNITY-RELATIONS; RESOURCE; COMPANY; ACCOUNTABILITY; GOVERNANCE; AGREEMENTS; AUSTRALIA; COUNTRIES; BUSINESS; INDUSTRY	In 2002 the International Institute of Environment and Development published the landmark report Breaking New Ground: Mining, Minerals and Sustainable Development (MMSD). The report portrayed an industry distrusted by stakeholders and under threat from opposition groups. When read closely, the MMSD report reveals an inextricable link between industry's 'survival' instincts and the notion of a social licence. Within the context of a growing divergence around the expectations of minerals-led development, social licence has emerged as an industry response to opposition and a mechanism to ensure the viability of the sector. The objective of this article is to reinvigorate discussion and debate over how best to frame the industry's social and environmental obligations and how these obligations can be met by the sector. Where social licence has contributed to raising the profile of social issues within a predominantly industrial discourse, a primary failure is its inability to articulate a collaborative developmental agenda for the sector or a pathway forward in restoring the lost confidence of impacted communities, stakeholders, and pressure groups. We argue that a necessary first step in this process is for industry to reconcile its internal risk-orientation with external expectations which requires a less defensive and more constructive approach to stakeholder engagement and collaboration.

The Latvian sample consisted of 1005 inhabitants of Latvia aged from 18 to 74 (M = 44.77, SD = 14.58), 47.8% males and 52.2% females. The Lithuanian sample consisted of 1005 inhabitants of Lithuania aged from 18 to 91 (M= 52.15, SD = 17.75), 42.2% males and 52.8% females. Four questions from Omnibus survey were used - three questions measured dimensions of anomia (normiessness, social isolation, and meaninglessness), and one question measured subjective well-being. It was found that both in Latvian and Lithuanian samples normlessness, social isolation, and meaninglessness are negatively related to subjective well-being, and all three dimensions of anomia are significant predictors for subjective well-being explaining 9% of variance in total. Psychological help in decreasing of anomia can be important for improvement of subjective well-being.

J	Nitlarp, T; Kiattisin, S				Nitlarp, Theerasak; Kiattisin, Supaporn			The Impact Factors of Industry 4.0 on ESG in the Energy Sector	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Industry 4; 0; ESG; energy sector; digital transformation; sustainable development	DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION; RESEARCH AGENDA; PLS-SEM; LEXIMANCER; FUTURE; PERSPECTIVE; FRAMEWORK; TOOL; IOT	Digital transformation refers to highly thought-out social, manufacturing, and organizational transitions driven by digital revolutions and emerging technologies. On the other hand, energy is a critical pillar of the economic growth of the country. Meanwhile, global interest in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investment is growing. The conventional investment paradigm is being phased out in favor of investments that prioritize environmental, social, and corporate responsibility. The energy sector is one of the most significantly affected. Presently, the field of digital transformation is limited in its analysis about the sustainability factors and is still controversial, especially in the energy business. This paper identifies an in-corporation factor in Industry 4.0, taking into account the effect on ESG. The research papers and the World Economic Forum reports were investigated and identified the correlation factor using machine learning to analyze their contents. We spotlighted the documents relevant to the energy industry and sustainable development. To quantify the model, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is proposed to generate a valid model, followed by path analysis with latent variables to evaluate the structural equation modeling (SEM).

Using an exploratory qualitative case study, it investigates why and how a corporation translates its sustainability strategy (value proposition) into corporate foundations that generate social capital (value creation and delivery), and sustainability performance (value capture) from 1980 to 2011. Two corporate foundations dealing with small enterprise and skilled labour development within one of Indonesia's largest public listed companies were chosen for cross-case analysis. Primary and secondary data from company documents, archival records, interviews and observations were analysed to develop a theoretical model. The study finds the importance for companies to play 'hybrid' roles as profit and non-profit institution in building sustainable business model. The corporate foundations, which are the non-profit arm of the corporations, deal with social issues that intersect with business needs. Stakeholder relations and resource allocations through the foundations have developed social capital, which enable the company and its stakeholders to co-create value to achieve triple bottom line performance for both. This research contributes to the management literature as it integrates the concept of social capital, and clarifies the actual linkages between value proposition, value creation and delivery, and value capture in a sustainable business model. The theoretical model from the research can be replicated by other companies, especially for the ones operating in emerging economies. However, further research is needed to test its applications to other context.

It asks how a community's first reactions to a crisis can indicate the possible future development of a destination's sustainability, and examines the resilience properties of elasticity, hysteresis and malleability in relation to single- and multiple-loop learning. Empirically, this study explores public discussions about tourism in northern Norway immediately before, and during the first months of, the COVID-19 crisis. Such discussions are investigated through a qualitative content analysis of articles from the regional newspaper. The findings identify a variety of perspectives among the participants to the discussions reported in the newspaper, including the coexistence of different views on tourism and sustainability and on responses to a crisis. This study frames the discussions in terms of elastic, hysteretic and malleable reactions, and illustrates three learning paths towards alternative weak and strong sustainable futures in a conceptual model. The originality of this study concerns a conceptualisation of the resilience - sustainability relationship as a set of learning paths that emphasises the dynamic and non-deterministic aspects of tourism development, aiming to evoke a sense of both responsibility and empowerment.

Collaboration between companies can assist them to become more sustainable. Even though collaboration can be seen as instrumental in developing more sustainable companies, the rise of e-business has changed the game in terms of attaining high performance. Thus, this study investigates the relations among supplier collaboration, sustainability, and market performance in the context of e-business. Specifically, the aim of this study is to determine how supplier collaboration leads small e-businesses to develop e-business sustainability and, in turn, deliver enhanced market performance. The data were collected with a cross-sectional random sampling of small online store operators in Finland. Supplier collaboration was found to influence market performance via e-business sustainability. The results offer implications for firms operating in e-business by supporting collaboration with suppliers and sustainability values while maintaining high market performance.

Particularly: the ports could capture a greater share of added value by favoring the development of their surrounding in order to accommodate not only the full complement of services required for the maintenance and repair, but also the assembly units and freight distribution hubs. Thus, the subject of this paper deals with the topic of harbors and their intersection with the urban core of the city they territorially belong. in a narrow sense, this paper aims at evaluatina current conditions for integrated spatial and transport development: considenng the ports and the inland railway connection. The case study for this research is the port of Piraeus and its relation to the surrounding Lirban pattern. The main reason behind choosing Piraeus is the integral connection of the cart or to the Greek capital, as well as recent transformation of the harbor in the international context. Considering the external interferences to induce the mass-transit freight and passenger transportation, neither the port city of Piraeus nor Athens is prepared for the urban transformation according to the principles of transport oriented development (TOD). Hence, the central focus of the paper deals with the thorough analysis of the present spatial problems, possibilities and values in the Piraeus port and its direct surrounding: which further supports intervention on the nodal level. Research methodology consists of several steps. Firstly, since this paper is part if an extensive research project investigating the potentials of Athens agglomeration in terms of future spatial and infrastructural development, the data based on the field research will be analyzed. Secondly, the overview of existing documents (primary and secondary sources) on both spatial and transport development in the city of Athens will be critically analyzed. The paper concludes with the critical overview of Pie present state regarding TOD in the port of Piraeus (i.e Rotterdam of the south), as well as basic recommendations for ills future development. mainly aiming to respond to a dynamic of self-organizing governance in forging a new conceptual basis for long-term strategic partnership.

J	Wen, SG; Zhao, JC				Wen, Shuangge; Zhao, Jingchen			The Commons, the Common Good and Extraterritoriality: Seeking Sustainable Global Justice through Corporate Responsibility	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						the commons; the common good; multinational enterprises; extraterritoriality; corporate responsibility; extraterritorial commons	SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; BUSINESS; CSR; DISCLOSURE; RIGHTS; UK; ACCOUNTABILITY; SUBSIDIARIES; GOVERNANCE; FRAMEWORK	Despite their laudable intent, extraterritorial legal initiatives to promote corporate sustainability development have not been well received in practice, and are often seen as a window-dressing exercise. This article aims to conduct a conceptual and doctrinal analysis, offering a theoretical foundation that interprets corporate extraterritorial legislative attempts as legitimate in the context of globalisation, using the lens of "the commons" and "the common good". We try to link the values and dimensions of "the commons" to the goals of corporate extraterritorial legislation, so that lawmaking attempts with extraterritorial reach will gain additional foundational support and achieve more effective and better controlled compliance. In particular, the article makes an original attempt to justify and develop a new notion, namely "the extraterritorial commons". This notion is in harmony with, rather than contradicting, progressive legal attempts to address the mismatching and conflicting nature of the relationship between the traditional voluntarism of corporate extraterritorial responsibilities, particularly in relation to sustainability issues, and global trends towards more regulation in this area.

J	Asmal, K				Asmal, K			Water as a metaphor for governance: issues in water resources management in Africa	NATURE & RESOURCES			English	Article								As we approach a new century and a new millennium, much attention is being given to water and our management of it, reflected in 1997 in the diffusion of a comprehensive assessment of the freshwater resources of the world and in the convening in Morocco of the First World Water Forum. Events such as these have served to bring new perspectives to bear on the management of water resources. An example is in South Africa, where water and its management is being viewed at the highest levels of government as a metaphor for development and people's relations with one another. Here, the old heroic concept of water resource development, which challenged engineers to make water available to those who needed it, has been replaced by a more modest vision - that of managing the quantity, quality and reliability of the nation's water resources to achieve optimum long-term, environmentally sustainable, social and economic development for society from their use.

It explores the role of the ICC in relation to the domestic, regional, and international political events taking place during its fort-native years in order to provide the basis through which the ICC came to be a political authority in the Arctic. While the main coalescence of events was around the theme of Arctic resource development, each event significantly helped lay the foundation for, and structures under which, Arctic policy would proceed into the future. This includes a changing Arctic narrative that has transformed the Arctic from a being a region concentrated on resource extraction and Cold War security into a region serving as a symbolic pinnacle for global sustainable development. Through the expanded political agency of the ICC and an international focus on the Arctic, a vision of the Arctic has emerged under which it is defined by its natural environment and by the indigenous peoples who inhabit this space.

However, the prevalence of physical inactivity in Germany is high and most people do not reach the amount of physical activity that is recommended by the World Health Organization. To support targeted measures of physical activity promotion, it is necessary to gain knowledge of relevant actors, professionals groups and multiplicators as well as their structural connection. In an explorative study, 2 goals were addressed: (1) the identification of relevant actors, professional groups and multiplicators of physical activity promotion in Germany, and (2) the analysis of structural relations among these actors as well as the formulation of recommendations for the sustainable development of a national network of physical activity promotion. For that purpose, qualitative expert interviews, a subsequent network visualization and an analysis for network development were carried out. It became apparent that the field of actors in the area of physical activity promotion is very heterogeneous and extensive with regard to different forms of actors, sectors of society and administrative levels. Overall, 128 actors were identified, of which 22 actors are considered to hold key positions. Concerning the multiplicators, 19 current and 17 potential ones were identified. Structural relations among actors are sparse. For future network development, various prerequisites, benefits, and barriers were revealed. network of physical activity promotion are given.

This claim rests on the assumption that the diversity of resources within rural areas can be a potential source for place-shaping practices and sustainability. Moreover, this shift away from a top-down sectorial toward a more territorial focus has also shed light on the importance of agency, relations, and how people engage. Many rural areas in Europe, and particularly in Portugal, have seen a withdrawal of focus away from agriculture toward more diversified activities, where place-based approaches can untap local potential, stimulate sustainable place-shaping practices, and create significant well-being. However, some rural communities have difficulties in capitalizing on them due to unfavorable demographics such as depopulation and aging, a focus on traditional industries, and a lack of technical knowledge. The aim of the article is to discuss the role of place-based policies for enabling place-shaping practices revolving around traditional resources in rural areas and their contribution to sustainability. The study briefly highlights the recent debate around European rural development policies and illustrates their implementation through place-shaping practices via a case study in a Portuguese rural village-Varzea de Calde. The village revalorized itself and is trying to tackle marginalization processes through its traditional linen, which is a local material and immaterial resource, via collective agency and a strong sense of identity. The case study will provide empirical insights in discussing the effects of sustainable place-shaping practices stimulating by place-based policy instruments. Our conclusions highlight the positive contributions toward sustainability through improvements in social (e.g., identity) and economic well-being.

Leaders, especially logistics leaders, in modern society help to cooperate within private and public sector, educational institutions and state armed components for sustainability. The knowledge base nowadays is oriented on achieving of success usually in the exogenous factors as economical capital. More comprehensive access to success is based on embraces financial, social, and environmental sustainability as the foundation-stone. Learning and especially development of leaders' competencies play a key role in logistic education. Then current education understanding is based on all life process which could develop opportunities for sustainability. The question on attitude between sustainability and business opportunities is also depended on leader's continuing education and educational institution ability to influence leader's leadership processes. This paper presents understanding of success of military logistic leaders, findings of evaluation leadership competences of final year logistic students at University of Defence in Brno (Czech Republic), where the research was conducted in. Methodological approach concerned transformational leadership and transactional leadership and also sustainability. As the research technique was questionnaire. The goal of the empirical work was to identify transformational and transactional leadership in a group of final year students of logistic and such barriers to explain problems of relation to sustainability.

J	Trundle, A; Organo, V				Trundle, Alexei; Organo, Vanessa			Urban adaptation pathways at the edge of the anthropocene: lessons from the Blue Pacific Continent	URBAN GEOGRAPHY			English	Article; Early Access						Urban planning; climate adaptation; informal settlements; Pacific Islands; sustainable development	CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOLOMON-ISLANDS; CYCLONE PAM; PORT VILA; RESILIENCE; LAND; CITIES; URBANIZATION; COLONIALISM; CHALLENGES	Pacific Island cities exhibit high levels of informality. In these spaces, traditional cultural practices and production converge with the periphery of global financial markets and systems of trade and production. These hybrid, nonconforming urban systems fall between regional policy agendas, requiring practitioners to embed urban considerations within broader regional platforms such as climate change. This paper demonstrates how these "covert" processes are used to advance urban justice at a settlement scale, both within and in resistance to city-level resilience frameworks and governance. In addition to a wider review of secondary data and Pacific urban literature the authors - non-Indigenous Pacific urban experts - draw upon empirical evidence from climate resilient development initiatives across the region. This includes case studies from the two Vanuatu municipalities of Luganville and Port Vila, and Honiara, the capital of Solomon Islands. Approaches for negotiating divergences between these functional systems of traditional and state justice within the urban domain are proposed, particularly in relation to disaster response and climate resilient development.

Therefore, facilitation of exports is important, especially in regional level thus ensuring more integrated regional development. As the competition increases globally, identification of export target countries and export market research are becoming increasingly important. The choice of the export target countries is done in several levels government, associations and enterprises. If the same export target countries are chosen at different levels, enterprises can focus more on increasing competitiveness rather than on marketing activities. The aim of the study is to create a tool for determining the export target countries of Latvia. This implies the choice of the most appropriate indicators to characterise selected criteria, which are obtained from several statistical databases and world-wide assessments like Doing Business, Worldwide Governance Indicators and others. The elaborated export target country selection tool comprises data of 2016 for 240 countries. All the initial data are first ranked and then consolidated in 10 criteria, which are used for final ranking of all the countries. The representative of the Ministry of Economics found the tool useful. It is best suited for the initial selection of export target countries, which then can be analysed more thoroughly. The use of the tool by export authorities can ensure more qualitative cooperation, help to avoid duplication of information and plan international relations and export facilitation activities more efficiently thus ensuring more advantages to enterprises. The tool can be extended also for use by enterprises.

The period also comes with far-reaching changes in knowledge-gathering, which has become more compartmentalised, fragmented and specialised. This is reflected in the ways of working of both academic and government institutions, and has led to incomplete knowledge and understanding of human ecology, and the formulation of unwise, strongly sectoral policies, not least in respect to the understanding, planning and managing the dynamics of energy use and land-use change in an era of global climate change. This study contributes to addressing the perceived shortcoming by comparing patterns of energy consumption in two research locations in peri-urban Accra: representing a more urbanised, and a cluster of rural communities, respectively. The study applied an inter-disciplinary approach combining expert interviews, a literature review, and an in-depth change analysis based on remote sensing/geo-information systems. The paper establishes a relationship between land-use change and wood-fuel and LPG usage mediated by geographical and socioeconomic discrepancies. We conclude that different peri-urban patterns are driven by geographic, historical, cultural and economic disparities. Therefore, if energy policies and strategies for sustainable development are to be successfully constructed, there is the need to accommodate and enforce land-use policies by adopting a comprehensive approach to governance(1).

Who should own what? Moreover, when should local ownership be introduced? Using the case of Afghanistan as a fruitful example, this article suggests that ownership is key for understanding the interactions between international and local actors as it highlights the asymmetry of this power relation. In all three types of roles that the international actors can perform-intervenor; mentor, or facilitator such an asymmetric power relation exists. For Afghanistan, the result of the different approaches to local ownership has been a complex form of hybrid peace ownership where the international actors have become intertwined in almost all aspects of Afghan life. As the international actors are decreasing their involvement by moving from the role of intervenor to the role of mentor, the sustainability of development and stability in Afghanistan will undoubtedly be put to the test.

One frame relates to transformation in global environmental governance that promotes goal-oriented agendas. The other frame relates to earth system sciences where sustainability transformation means breaking the devastating trends of the Anthropocene. In this paper, we examine the historical and cultural underpinnings of these two frames, each invoking particular relations and approaches to sustainability transformation. Our contribution is to discuss the role of the past in these frames and to illuminate how current outlooks toward the future still rely on principles that emerged in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Europe and thus hinder alternative approaches to transformation in the present.

As a result, there is a set of rules deriving from complex relational structures competing to define self-organized collective action for sustainability. This paper analyses the structure of relations within FCNs. With this end in view, research on the experience of FCNs has been done, in particular of Solidarity Purchasing Groups (henceforth SPGs) in Sicily (Southern Italy). By applying Social Network Analysis, the article identifies what role each participant in the network plays; that is, who can influence long-term collective action.

Although this tree holds high cultural significance for Dagomba women, it is unfortunately becoming scarcer in our study area near Tamale. We investigate the reasons for this decline in relation to the agricultural, ecological, and cultural landscape and discuss the gendered impacts of these changes. Research in these communities was conducted between 2018 and 2021 as part of a transdisciplinary action research approach to process underutilized species with women's groups. The research started with a survey that included 27 women's groups in 13 communities with 524 women participants. Out of a selected number of groups, our research team has worked more intensively with three women's groups near Nyankpala, which selected for their processing focus the African Locust Bean, locally known as dawadawa. More than 45 group sessions were organized with seven groups in a collaborative learning process in 2019. Additionally, the three groups in Kpachi who chose to process the African Locust Bean sustained facilitation of group activities until the end of 2021. Specifically, on the topic of the decline of this tree, 19 semistructured interviews were conducted in August 2020 with 8 female farmers, 7 male farmers and 4 chiefs in the local governance system. Our results show the cultural significance of the African Locust Bean for women in the Dagomba culture as well as practical uses of all parts of the tree. Specifically, the seeds are used for making a fermented condiment and tea. Although seeds of the African Locust Bean are considered a women's crop, their access to this tree is mediated by the local chiefs and often male land-users. Most farmers interviewed reported a reduction in trees in their fields. The reasons for the decrease can be summarized in six different categories, (1) aging tree populations, (2) challenge caring for saplings until maturity, (3) agricultural changes with increased mechanization and pesticide use, (4) over-use as a firewood resource, (5) usufruct rights between traditional chiefs, male land-owners, and women who should be granted access to the trees according to Dagomba cultural values, and (6) reduced water availability inhibits seed yield. In conclusion, there is an urgent need for action to protect and restore the African Locust Bean within northern Ghana's savannah landscape to ensure continued access and benefits of the tree to women in the region.

J	Paradis, G; Schiehll, E				Paradis, Gabriel; Schiehll, Eduardo			ESG Outcasts: Study of the ESG Performance of Sin Stocks	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						key ESG performance; sin stocks; environmental; social; governance; comparative analysis	FIRMS	Certain economic actors are considered by many as involved in or associated with an activity that is considered unethical or immoral, such as the producers of tobacco, alcohol and firearms (often referred to as sin stocks). In an environment in which stakeholders are increasingly interested in sustainable development and corporate social responsibility, it is important to understand how firms respond to these issues which divide public opinion. Our study compares the environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance for a targeted sample of 79 sin stocks and a control group of comparable firms. We observe that sin stocks have a lower overall ESG performance as well as for each of the three ESG pillars, and that this difference is more significant in relation to governance and some key social and environmental issues for which sin stocks could have compensated risk exposure with responsible management practices. In other words, our results demonstrate that sin stocks are exposed to more severe ESG issues and consistently lack the necessary practices to mitigate these issues. Our study provides relevant insights into the informativeness of ESG scores to distinguish firms (and sectors) investing in management practices that offset ESG risk exposure.

Drawing on critical discourse analysis and corpus linguistics, this study examines how China's flagship English-language newspaper China Daily communicates climate change (2010-2019) to international audiences and how it represents China and the US as well as China-US relations regarding climate issues. Results show that through the use of specific modalities and other collocates of China and the US, the newspaper constructs China as a responsible major country and the US as a capricious and self-centered nation while emphasizing the importance of their cooperation on climate actions. The ways it represents this issue can be interpreted with regard to pragmatism and the China Dream of national rejuvenation endorsed by the Chinese government. To have a stable environment for sustainable development of China and the whole world, China is willing to avoid confrontation and work together with the US and other countries in combating climate change though competition may remain in such related fields as green energy, as indicated by China Daily.

This paper looks at the changes in forest-specific legislation applicable to regular productive forests, across 28 European countries. We compare the legal framework applicable in the mid-1990s with that applicable in 2015, using the Property Rights Index in Forestry (PRIF) to measure changes across time and space. The paper shows that forest owners in most western European countries already had high decision-making power in the mid-1990s, following deregulation trends from the 1980s; and for the next two decades, distribution of rights remained largely stable. For these countries, the content and direction of changes indicate that the main pressure on forest-focused legislation comes from environmental discourses (e.g. biodiversity and climate change policies). In contrast, former socialist countries in the mid-1990s gave lower decision-making powers to forest owners than in any of the Western Europe countries; over the next 20 years these show remarkable changes in management, exclusion and withdrawal rights. As a result of these changes, there is no longer a clear line between western and former socialist countries with respect to the national governance systems used to address private forest ownership. Nevertheless, with the exception of Baltic countries which have moved towards the western forest governance system, most of the former socialist countries still maintain a state-centred approach in private forest management. Overall, most of the changes we identified in the last two decades across Europe were recorded in the categories of management rights and exclusion rights. These changes reflect the general trend in European forest policies to expand and reinforce the landowners' individual rights, while preserving minimal rights for other categories of forest users; and to promote the use of financial instruments when targeting policy goals related to the environmental discourse.

J	Kiessling, C				Kiessling, Christopher			Internalizing flexibility on climate change regulations: An analysis of the Brazilian case	RELACIONES INTERNACIONALES			Spanish	Article						Brazil; climate change; localization; Kyoto Protocol; Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)	FOREIGN-POLICY; POLITICS; REGIMES	Since the institutionalization of sustainable development within the context of global environmental governance, market-based environmental policy instruments began to gain legitimacy and to be perceived as the most efficient mechanisms to achieve compatibility between the promotion of economic growth and environmental protection. In relation to climate governance, this consensus was consolidated with the signing of the Kyoto Protocol and the flexibility mechanisms designed to facilitate compliance with the goals set forth in the agreement. This article describes the localization process of the flexibility mechanisms in the Brazilian public discourse on climate change from 2005 to 2015 from an International Relations constructivist perspective. The work presents three relevant contributions on the literature on the internalization of international environmental and climate norms, to wit: the process of localization of the flexibilization mechanisms in Brazil has not been linear; the context of discursive hegemony of liberal environmentalism was a critical factor in the internalization of flexibilization mechanisms; and civil society actors, as well as other sub-national and non-state actors, have great relevance in the internalization and implementation of these norms.

Participation in decision-making processes of community development agents: a study from Peru	COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT JOURNAL			English	Article							ORGANIZATIONS; DEMOCRACY; MEXICO	This article argues that although Civil Social Organizations aspire towards a culture of participatory process-driven governance and management, the reality seems far from this aspiration. A culture of participatory processes is understood in this study as working and decisional engagement practices which are part of internal decision-making and action-taking processes from Community Development Agents (CDAs). This brings an ethical dilemma, as these organizations claim to operate upon principles of participation, solidarity, democracy, social justice, human dignity and decent work. Through this study, 506 Peruvian CDAs offered their own analyses about the factors that foster and/or inhibit their participation in specific organizational managerial and professional developmental areas, such as: systemic planning, organization, sustainable management and empowerment. A combination of quantitative and qualitative methodologies was used to gain a comprehensive understanding of the field of study. Dialogical focus groups were applied, by which CDAs themselves identified and deconstructed the inhibiting and facilitating factors. The study echoes CDAs' aspiration to engage meaningfully with decision-making and action-taking processes as well as creating the participatory mechanisms and processes themselves. In order to do this, CDAs demand an ethical and democratic competence-based training, to empower them to democratize their organizational structures and to counterbalance their daily power relations and dynamics.

J	Bernstein, S				Bernstein, Steven			The absence of great power responsibility in global environmental politics	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS			English	Article						Climate change; environment; global governance; great powers; norms; responsibility	UNITED-STATES; GOVERNANCE; TRANSITION; PLURALISM; FUTURE; UNION; TRADE	Great powers routinely face demands to take on special responsibilities to address major concerns in global affairs, and often gain special rights for doing so. These areas include peace and security, global economic management, development, and egregious violations of human rights. Despite the rise in the importance and centrality of global environmental concerns, especially climate change and issues covered by the new Sustainable Development Goals, norms or institutions that demand or recognize great power responsibility are notably absent. This absence is puzzling given expectations in several major strands of International Relations theory, including the English School, realism, liberalism, and constructivism. Drawing on the reasoning behind these expectations, the absence of great power responsibility can be explained by a lack of congruence between systemic and environmental "great powers," weak empirical links between action on the environment and the maintenance of international order, and no link to special rights. Instead, the institutionalized distribution of environmental responsibilities arose out of North-South conflict and has eroded over time, becoming more diffuse and decentered from ideas of state responsibility. These findings suggest a need to rethink the relationship among great powers and special rights and responsibilities regarding the environment, as well as other new issues of systemic importance.

Furthermore, the influence of cultural diversity on the board of directors on CO2 emissions is analysed. A sample of companies belonging to the MSCI and MSCI Emerging Market indices in Europe over ten years (2010-2019) was analysed using regression models with panel data. The results demonstrate that in both developed and developing markets, the ratio of women to men on the board of directors is inversely related to the company's CO2 emissions, which support legitimacy theory in two aspects: it fulfils the right to equality and non-discrimination for women, and it also reduces CO2 emissions. In general, cultural diversity had a negative influence on CO2 emissions. This research is relevant for policymakers and managers seeking to improve sustainability and equality policies in companies. If gender equality in corporate monitoring roles is environmentally beneficial for the planet, legislators will support quota policies. In addition, shareholders will have an incentive to implement gender equality policies, as they will legitimise the company in the eyes of society, which has economic benefits. On a practical level, this work will contribute to achieving gender equality in corporate governance and improve the understanding of factors influencing CO2 emissions to the environment. This study contributes to previous research since it is the first time that developed and emerging countries have been analysed with the same methodology in relation to gender and CO2 emissions. Moreover, this research differentiates between emission-sensitive and insensitive sectors, and it is the only study to carry out a sector-by-sector and a country-by-country analysis. Furthermore, cultural diversity on corporate boards has been scarcely studied so far in relation to CO2 emissions.

Yet such a perspective, however consoling, assumes a teleology that is far from guaranteed. What will happen is far from easy to predict; nevertheless, this paper pinpoints several key issues that impact on the future of journalism. It also advances some general propositions and a broad periodisation around UNESCO's historical role in relation to these issues. The analysis gives particular attention to political and economic matters, the safety of journalists and internet governance. Each of these dimensions entails existential threats to journalism, but some opportunities are also noted. Four paradoxes are also identified, with tensions that may lead to change in one direction or another.

Impacts of Community-Based Forest Management Policies Implemented by a Local Forest Institution: A Case Study from Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya, Philippines	SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY			English	Article						Common-pool resources; Tenure reform; Collaborative governance; Forest decentralization; LIFE indicators	MULTILEVEL GOVERNANCE; PROPERTY-RIGHTS; RESOURCES; NEPAL; DECENTRALIZATION; REFORMS; INDIA	A number of developing countries have implemented forest tenure reforms, including community forestry, to achieve social justice. While many studies have assessed the impact of community forestry, few have examined how interventions of local forest institutions influence the conditions of forests and forest dwellers. This study addresses this gap by examining the impacts of forest management policies implemented by the Federation of Vista Hills, Kalongkong and Kakilingan Upland Farmers, Inc. (Federation) in Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya, Philippines. Specifically, the study aimed to: (1) examine these interventions in relation to livelihood, income, forest condition, and equity (LIFE) indicators; (2) measure the impacts of these interventions on LIFE indicators; (3) analyze relations between the interventions and LIFE indicators; and (4) identify policy implications to promote sustainable and equitable benefits from local forest governance. Data were compiled from a household-level survey, interviews, satellite image analysis, and a secondary data review. Correlation analysis was performed on the survey results. The Federation's interventions were found to have improved forest condition and equity. However, they had limited impact on livelihoods and no significant effect on household incomes. Hence, the Federation needs to undertake household-level initiatives to improve the financial capital of forest-dependent populations. Moreover, policy-makers should devolve the issuance of resource use permits to local Department of Environment and Natural Resources offices. Central forest policies, particularly those on forest resource utilization, require adaptation to local situations as incentives for forest-dependent populations to sustainably manage forest resources.

Accordingly, considering the national environmental performance among the EU countries in 2006-2019 period, we grouped them and concentrated on the clusters registering the highest and lowest levels, analyzing how the components of the human and economic dimensions influence it. Applying panel data models, our main results emphasized that, firstly, for the countries with a better environmental performance, sufficient drinking water, safe sanitation, education, gender equality, and good governance were significant; in the countries with the lowest levels of environmental wellbeing, sufficient food, sufficient to drink, education, and income distribution were insignificant, while the remaining components were relevant. Secondly, in both groups of countries, organic farming and public debt were significant; nevertheless, differences were observed for genuine savings and employment, for which the peculiarities of economic activities seemed to be materialized as different influences upon environmental wellbeing. Our study draws alarm signals regarding the development patterns applied in the EU, seeming to have results that strengthen the sustainable goals, but not sufficient for exceeding the traditional growth-oriented model.

J	Sanderink, L; Nasiritousi, N				Sanderink, Lisa; Nasiritousi, Naghmeh			How institutional interactions can strengthen effectiveness: The case of multi-stakeholder partnerships for renewable energy	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Effectiveness; Global governance; Institutional interactions; Multi-stakeholder partnerships; Renewable energy	PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS; GLOBAL ENERGY; CLIMATE GOVERNANCE; PERFORMANCE; POLITICS; ORGANIZATIONS; REGIME	Sustainable Development Goal 7 and the Paris Agreement reiterate the importance of a worldwide uptake of renewable energy. However, the present growth rate of renewables in the global energy mix is too slow to meet international targets. There exists at present a wide range of institutions with different characteristics that work internationally to promote a steeper increase. Whereas previous studies have examined the institutional landscape for renewable energy and the considerable interactions occurring across institutions, it remains unclear what the implications of these institutional interactions are for effectiveness. This paper assesses how institutional interactions can strengthen effectiveness, by focusing on three multi-stakeholder partnerships for renewable energy. Based on an expert survey and semi-structured interviews, the study provides both theoretical and empirical contributions to understanding institutional interactions in relation to effectiveness. Moreover, it provides insights on how to strengthen the effectiveness of multi-stakeholder partnerships for renewable energy. Results show that different levels and types of institutional interactions may influence effectiveness differently, with the sharing of procedural information and coordination mechanisms being considered most fruitful to increase effectiveness. Importantly, however, such interactions should not harm the autonomy, nor the efficiency of multi-stakeholder partnerships.

J	Fedotov, D				Fedotov, Dmitriy			What has been done and what has not - the government of Canada's economic policy response to the coronavirus pandemic	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL ANALYSIS			English	Article; Early Access						Governance; Crisis management; Federalism; Economic policy response to COVID-19; Intergovernmental relations (IGR)	DEMOCRATIC DEFICIT; PREFERENCES; DYNAMICS; POLITICS; POWER	Purpose This paper aims to examine Canadian government measures to support country's economic recovery and sustainable development. The goal is to examine whether all orders of government are working well to deliver the required help to Canadians. Design/methodology/approach The theoretical foundations for this article are drawn from liberal and institutionalist approaches to comparative politics. Specifically, the proposed study draws on political tensions that occur because of actions of self-centered regional (provincial) governments who legitimize individual policies based on their self-centered economic and political objectives. Findings Nowadays, we can observe the primary role of the state in supporting and regulating the health governance systems, the economy and social life. Many informal groups have unstructured approach, which does not require them to follow existing strategies. The challenges caused by COVID-19 have led to the resurgence of collective, state-based approaches to the recovery. The key findings illuminate the importance of crisis communication activities which should be implemented properly. This implies that all disclosures must be timely and truthful. Practical implications The study helps to better understand the events that disrupt parts of the Canadian economy during pandemic. It reviews the essential functions that are critical for reliable operation of infrastructure services to ensure safety and well-being of the population. During the COVID-19, federal-provincial-territorial collaboration runs into resistance because of competing interests, resource constraints, legacies from past conflicts and lack of coordination. In contrast to managers, who often focus on tangible short-term results, today's leadership more often seeks intangible long-term results. This means that the central-local government relations tend to be more informal. Originality/value In the face of external shock, such as COVID-19, it did not take much time for Canadian provincial governments to realize that they cannot cope with a wide range of challenges alone. In these circumstances, the narratives of how governments work together during the challenging time to impact their desired outcomes are of crucial importance.

This article considers the dual challenges of energy and fuel poverty in Malaysia, a middle-income country boasting high levels of grid penetration, suggesting that there are limitations to this approach in relation to articulating the relationship between energy and poverty, specifying the dynamics of energy poverty, and informing policies to address this. Locating energy deprivation in the context of multidimensional poverty offers a basis for addressing energy poverty in a wider range of spatial and temporal contexts.

J	O'Manique, C; Fourie, P				O'Manique, Colleen; Fourie, Pieter			Gender justice and the Millennium Development Goals: Canada and South Africa considered	POLITIKON			English	Article							HUMAN-RIGHTS; REFLECTIONS; ECONOMICS; EDUCATION; VIOLENCE	The expiration of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2015 means that the global development industry has been working towards crafting an MDG 2.0, for the post-2015 context: the Sustainable Development Goals. There is both an explicit and an implicit gender focus in both the MDGs and SDGs. Three of the eight MDGs were directly targeted at women and girls, while there was a stated understanding that all eight goals apply equally to men and women. Despite robust PR, the 2010 and 2012 United Nations (UN) Reports on the MDGs cited persistent violence against women, and continued discrimination in access to education, work, and participation in governance. In other words, the MDGs and their metrics appear to have reaffirmed existing gender norms and relations rather than challenging the status quo. We survey critical explanations of this failure, in the Canadian and South African contexts, and apply a critical feminist lens to suggest an alternative framing of gender justice. We suggest that one cannot understand the limitations of the MDG model of empowerment for women without considering the broader socio-political and ideological contexts that shape developmental interventions: an understanding that is critical to the design of the SDGs if they are to transcend the shortcomings of the MDGs.

However, the key question, whether and how chief executive officers' (CEO) psychological characteristics exert its influence on corporate marketing activities with relation to environmental conservation, is still unsolved. The current study aimed at examining how the personality traits of CEOs affect corporate green marketing program (GMP), with primary regard to CEO narcissism. On the basis of a moderated mediation analysis on a batch of survey data from a sample of manufacturing firms in China, the findings showed that narcissistic CEOs are often associated with the higher level of the corporate green marketing program. Besides, corporate environmental strategy (ES) plays a role of mediator in the relationship between CEO narcissism and the implementation of green marketing. Furthermore, regulatory pressure not only significantly drives corporate environmental strategy and green marketing program but also moderates the relationships among CEO narcissism, corporate environmental strategy, and green marketing program. This study shines light on the establishment of management mode, which could illuminate both business practitioners and policymakers on the governance of sustainability.

J	Kurowski, M; Huk, K				Kurowski, Mateusz; Huk, Katarzyna			Selected Aspects of Corporate Social Responsibility in the Industry Related to the Production and Supply of Energy	ENERGIES			English	Article						CSR; environmental impact; social impact; corporate governance; energy industry; mining industry	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; MINING-INDUSTRY; ISSUES	The development of the economy is related not only to its benefits, but also its negative aspects. One of the negative impacts is the impact on the environment and society. Many types of industry and, in a narrower sense, of enterprises, adversely affect their surroundings. It is one of the many factors that has contributed to the growing popularity of the concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR). It is important to balance business and industry with the environment and community impacts. This study presents selected aspects of corporate social responsibility, such as society, the environment, and corporate governance in relation to the industry responsible for energy production and distribution. This group includes the energy sector (mining oil, gas, consumer fuels, and energy equipment and services), the materials sector (metallurgy and mining), as well as distribution (gas, electricity supply, independent energy producers, and renewable energy). The aim of the article was to present the level of implementation of the concept of corporate social responsibility in enterprises responsible for the production and supply of energy. The article uses the analysis of the literature and the statistical analysis showing the level of use of the described concept in the analysed entities. It was based on an analysis of 1904 companies from 41 countries around the world. The article presents the level of implementation of the concept of corporate social responsibility in selected sectors, divided into three areas: social, environmental, and corporate governance. In each of them, the analysis was performed with regard to the selected, most important factors. In addition, an analysis of the described industry, in relation to the others, is presented, which shows the level of use of individual CSR aspects. Thus, it shows which criteria are followed by enterprises in their activities and indicates the real areas of CSR impact on companies.

J	Rasmussen, LM				Rasmussen, Louise Mubanda			In the Name of Sustainability: Contradictory Effects of NGO-Driven Development in Malawi	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH			English	Article						sustainability; NGOs; community; ethnography of aid; governmentality; orphans and vulnerable children	AIDS; PARTICIPATION; GOVERNANCE; POWER; ETHNOGRAPHY; EMPOWERMENT; POLITICS; POLICY	It is a core principle in non-governmental organisation (NGO)-driven development that interventions must be 'sustainable'. Individuals and communities are to be 'empowered' to take responsibility for their own development in ways that will eventually make donor funding redundant. On the basis of ethnographic fieldwork with NGOs supporting 'orphans and vulnerable children' in Malawi, this article explores the practices, social relations and contradictory effects that the vision of sustainability engenders. The article illustrates how the commitment to sustainability paradoxically produces practices that can only be sustained through continuous flows of donor funding. It argues that the persistence of sustainability as an organising principle is connected both to its self-confirming logic and to the ways in which practices of 'sustainability' shape the subjectivities of local brokers and come to constitute a central avenue for pursuing personal projects of development.

J	Isleyen, B				Isleyen, Beste			The European Union and neoliberal governmentality: Twinning in Tunisia and Egypt	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS			English	Article						Arab uprisings; development support; European Union; Michel Foucault; neoliberal governmentality; North Africa	EU DEMOCRACY PROMOTION; POLITICS; STATES; GOVERNANCE; LIMITS	As a response to the Arab uprisings that started in 2010, the European Union has emphasised, more determinated than ever, the urgency of inclusive and sustainable socio-economic development in the Arab region. The central objective of this article is to understand the nature and operation of European Union support for development following Arab mass movements. More specifically, it examines the European Union's Twinning instrument in Egypt and Tunisia through a neoliberal governmentality framework, with a major focus on visualisations, technologies and subject formation. This approach enables us to observe the application of an agenda through which Twinning intervenes into non-economic domains of governance in the target countries and aims at shaping these spheres by economic rationalities and techniques. By constructing change around local governance capabilities, the Twinning programme acts upon individual skills, institutional arrangements and relationships, deploys benchmarking techniques, and empowers subjects and government behaviour in order to bring conduct to certain economic logics and exercises. The outcome is the rendering of Tunisian and Egyptian socio-economic development open to enterprise-based, calculative and professionalised operations that make local conditions serviceable to neoliberal governing patterns, linkages and practices of business, capital production and investment.

INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS-POLITICS LAW AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Orchestration; Governance; Climate change adaptation; UNFCCC; Non-state actors	NON-STATE; GOVERNANCE; INITIATIVES; UNFCCC	Climate change adaptation is increasingly seen as a question that involves globally connected vulnerabilities and impacts which necessitate transboundary action by non-state and subnational (transnational) actors. Traditional actors such as governments and international organizations leave deficits in norm development, enforcement, capacity building, and financing. Orchestration has been suggested under the functionalist assumption that transnational actors can make up for these deficits, through optimizing complementarity between the realms of international and transnational governance and through eliciting more action toward the achievement of globally agreed climate goals. In the context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), orchestration has taken the form of an evolving Global Climate Action Agenda (GCAA). Few studies have examined the role of orchestration in bolstering transnational adaptation. This article therefore asks: Has the GCAA effectively mobilized and prioritized transnational adaptation action? Further, has it effectively addressed functional, participatory, and geographic deficits? Analyzing a unique dataset of a hundred cooperative climate actions, this study finds that current patterns are incongruent with some functionalist expectations. GCAA orchestration has featured a political prioritization of both adaptation and mitigation and a focus on building a positive narrative of climate action. This combination of priorities has led to neglect of underperforming actions-many of them adaptation actions in developing countries. Subsequent iterations of the GCAA failed to recognize these actions and did not identify support needed for them. This has strengthened the bias toward mitigation aspects of climate change and exacerbated imbalances in the geography of transnational action under the GCAA.

Stakeholders' perceptions of social and environmental changes affecting Everglades National Park in South Florida	ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Everglades National Park; Stakeholders' perceptions; Relationships; Social and environmental changes; Participatory engagement; Sustainable management	RESTORATION; MANAGEMENT; COMMUNICATION; ECOSYSTEM; POLITICS; FUTURE; AREAS	Urban sprawl and population growth have altered the landscape in the U.S in recent decades. Protected areas and development are compatible lenses, yet stakeholders' involvement in decision-making is often missing from environmental governance. Knowing how managers and stakeholders work together is also necessary to capture the meanings and feelings that local communities and various groups might have about a park and its ecosystem. The purpose of this study was to examine how stakeholders living and working in proximity to Everglades National Park (EVER) perceive environmental and social changes to the park and community relations. Data collection involved 41 interviews with stakeholders who have interacted with EVER, e.g., consumers, NGOs, federal agencies, state/local governments, businesses, and scientists. The in person, semi-structured interviews were conducted using snowball sampling. These data were generated using three methods: field notes, audio recordings, and transcripts. An analysis of the interview data generated six research themes: loss of native species, urban development, a shortage and contamination of water, hurricanes, climate change, and increased recreation use. The results of this study add to the literature by providing a better understanding of the relationships stakeholders have with national parks. The results will provide useable knowledge that may help stakeholders and public land managers design strategies for sustainable plans for the park and its surrounding communities.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE-AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW			English	Article						corporate social responsibility; corporate governance; sustainability index; market value; Tobin's q; panel data	MARKET VALUE; PERFORMANCE; GOVERNANCE; ETHICS; COMPENSATION; INVESTMENT; OWNERSHIP; VALUATION	A new movement reconciling corporate sustainability and investment is gaining world-wide attention. Whether corporate sustainability has an impact on market value is examined using large US non-financial firms from 1999 to 2002 in this paper. Taking Tobin's q as the proxy for firm value, a significantly positive relation between corporate sustainability and its market value is found. We also find a strong interaction effect between corporate sustainability and sales growth on firm value. Moreover, there is evidence to support that being sustainable causes a firm to increase its value. This indicates that companies with remarkable sustainable development strategies are more likely to be rewarded by investors with a higher valuation in the financial markets.

J	Enengel, B; Penker, M; Muhar, A; Williams, R				Enengel, Barbara; Penker, Marianne; Muhar, Andreas; Williams, Rachael			Benefits, efforts and risks of participants in landscape co-management: An analytical framework and results from two case studies in Austria	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Co-management; Cultural landscape; Landscape governance; Transaction costs; Local participation; Time effort	TRANSACTION COSTS; ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE; CITIZEN PARTICIPATION; PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT; MANAGEMENT; POLICIES; LEVEL; PARTNERSHIPS	Participatory processes in general and also in relation to managing landscape issues are gathering importance mostly due to arguments surrounding legitimacy and effectiveness in decision-making. The main aim of this research, based on a transaction costs perspective, is to present an integrated analytical framework in order to determine individual efforts (time, money), benefits and risks of participants in landscape co-management processes. Furthermore a reflection on the analytical approach developed and arising lessons to be learned for landscape co-management are presented. In the analytical framework benefit-components comprise of factors such as 'contributing to landscape maintenance/development and nature protection', 'representing one's interest group', 'co-deciding on relevant topics', 'providing and broadening one's knowledge' and 'building networks'. The risks of participation are related to a lack of information and agreements, missing support and actual decision-making power. The analytical framework is applied to two case studies in Austria: an EU LIFE-Nature project and a Cultural Landscape Project of the Provincial Government of Lower Austria. Analysis of the effort-benefit-relations provides an indication for a more effective design of co-management. Although the processes are rated as quite adequate, there is a low willingness of participants to commit additional time to co-management processes. In contrast to the Cultural Landscape Project, in the LIFE-Nature project, professionally involved persons participate next to partly and full volunteers. These uneven conditions of participation and an unfair distribution of transaction costs, jeopardize the promising chances co-management bears for landscape governance. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Panatsa, VM; Malandrakis, G				Panatsa, Vasiliki Maria; Malandrakis, Georgios			Student teachers' perceptions about the social pillar of urban sustainability: Attached importance and believed effectiveness of education	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Education for sustainable development; Effectiveness of education; Importance of social aspects; Social pillar; Student-teachers' views; Urban sustainable development; sustainability	GENDER-DIFFERENCES; INDICATORS; VULNERABILITY; COMPETENCES; ATTITUDES; HAZARDS	Purpose This study aims to detect preschool and primary school student-teachers' (STs) views about the social pillar of urban sustainability and particularly about the importance they attach to various social aspects of urban sustainability, and the perceived effectiveness of education in influencing these aspects. Design/methodology/approach A custom-designed questionnaire comprising eight literature-based social aspects of urban sustainability was developed and administered to 207 STs during the spring semester of 2015-2016, in the school of education, of a university located in northern Greece. Findings The highest levels of importance were attached to the aspect of Health, whereas aspects related to Policy and Governance were considered as the least important of all social aspects of urban sustainability. The aspect considered most easily influenced through education was that of Human Relations, in contrast to the aspect of Housing in which education was considered as the least effective. Also, STs considered every aspect of social urban sustainability to be more important than able to be influenced by education, revealing that they are somewhat sceptical of the effectiveness of education in this field. Research limitations/implications The participation of only student-teachers and the use of quantitative research tools are among the main limitation of the study. Future research should include teachers, both in-service and pre-service, from various disciplines and educational levels, and should employ a combination of quantitative with qualitative methods of analysis. Practical implications Insight into STs' views can serve as a useful guidance for teacher education programs, providing information about necessary actions that have to be taken for the improvement of both pre- and in-service teacher educations. Originality/value There is a great lack of research around pre- and in-service teachers' views about the importance of sustainability and the role of education in influencing it. Existing research is further scarcer when it comes to the investigation of the social pillar of urban sustainability, as literature usually focuses either on the environmental pillar of sustainability or on the concept of sustainable development in general.

Socio-technical regimes and sustainability transitions: Insights from political ecology	PROGRESS IN HUMAN GEOGRAPHY			English	Article						environmental governance; political ecology; socio-technical transition theory; sustainability	REGIONAL-DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION; BACK AGAIN; FOOD AID; LAND; GOVERNANCE; KNOWLEDGE; SCIENCE; POST; DEGRADATION	Sustainability is increasingly becoming a core focus of geography, linking subfields such as urban, economic, and political ecology, yet strategies for achieving this goal remain illusive. Socio-technical transition theorists have made important contributions to our knowledge of the challenges and possibilities for achieving more sustainable societies, but this body of work generally lacks consideration of the influences of geography and power relations as forces shaping sustainability initiatives in practice. This paper assesses the significance for geographers interested in understanding the space, time, and scalar characteristics of sustainable development of one major strand of socio-technical transition theory, the multi-level perspective on socio-technical regime transitions. We describe the socio-technical transition approach, identify four major limitations facing it, show how insights from geographers - particularly political ecologists - can help address these challenges, and briefly examine a case study (GMO and food production) showing how a refined transition framework can improve our understanding of the social, political, and spatial dynamics that shape the prospects for more just and environmentally sustainable forms of development.

J	Warbroek, B; Hoppe, T				Warbroek, Beau; Hoppe, Thomas			Modes of Governing and Policy of Local and Regional Governments Supporting Local Low-Carbon Energy Initiatives; Exploring the Cases of the Dutch Regions of Overijssel and Fryslan	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						local low-carbon energy initiatives; low-carbon policy; policy innovation; institutional adaptation; governance; energy transition; subnational governments	GRASS-ROOTS INNOVATIONS; COMMUNITY RENEWABLE ENERGY; DISTRIBUTED GENERATION; SUSTAINABLE ENERGY; SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WIND ENERGY; URBAN-DEVELOPMENT; GOVERNANCE; POWER	Recent scholarly attention shows increasing involvement of local low-carbon energy initiatives (LLCEIs) in governance and policy, in particular in relation to innovations regarding low-carbon energy and energy efficiency. The future perspective of active citizenship in the production of locally generated low-carbon energy is largely dependent on the existing institutional and policy frameworks and settings. Subnational governments, in particular, can have a prominent role in this process by engaging in institutional adaptation and policy innovation. The central research question of this paper is: In what ways do local and regional governments innovate in governing to respond to the emergence of LLCEIs? The research question is answered by comparing two case studies: the Dutch regions of Overijssel and Fryslan. We have conceptualized a meta-governing approach of experimentation, characterizing the innovations in governing that emerge when governments respond to the emergence of LLCEIs. We specifically focus on two capacities that subnational governments can use to enhance their governing capacity vis-a-vis LLCEIs and which substantiate the experimental meta-governance mode: institutional adaptation and policy innovation. We then formulated hypotheses that specify the expected policy innovations and institutional adaptations employed vis-a-vis LLCEIs. Data collection involved in-depth interviews and use of secondary data. The results show that a balancing process of authoritative and enabling modes of governing particularly characterized the type of policy innovations that were developed and the institutional adaptations that took place. Both provinces govern LLCEIs at arm's length and issue significant capacity-building strategies that vary in terms of their conditions. Municipalities, however, incline towards impromptu and opportunistic responses, some of them having lasting effects by patching up existing institutional settings, others having more of an episodic character. The results will further the understanding of subnational low-carbon policy and governance innovation processes vis-a-vis the role of LLCEIs.

A spatialised governmentality perspective	MARITIME STUDIES			English	Review						Blue Economy; Governmentality; Material; Spatial; Place; Space-times	DEGROWTH; GROWTH; FISHERIES; DISCOURSE; SPACES; SUSTAINABILITY; ONTOLOGIES; KNOWLEDGE; INSIGHTS; PLACE	The Blue Economy is a recent economic development paradigm, being promoted worldwide as a way to deliver sustainable ocean development in the context of the sustainable development goals. Research has drawn attention to its contested nature and the propensity of sectoral interests to co-opt it to their own ends. An emerging body of critical studies of the Blue Economy, as practiced, provides an opportunity to address the question "What is the blue economy?" in new ways. This review of published empirical case studies initiates a conversation between governmentality concepts and place-space-time theory, aiming to open new lines of enquiry regarding the influence of spatiality on the nature of governance. This approach has allowed the elucidation of a complex and nuanced understanding of the Blue Economy, complementing earlier discourse and content analyses. In relation to Blue Economy governance, I pose the specific question, "Does place matter?", leading to an interrogation of material and spatial relations in Blue Economy governance. I describe a complex spatialised governmentality, dominated by growth-based imaginaries and market-led practices. I draw attention to the production of ocean space through socio-material Blue Economy relations and the material and spatial contingency of its governance. Finally, I draw a distinction between "place" and "location" which has important consequences for Blue Economy governance.

This study takes stock of the state of energy in urban policy and planning and reveals potentials of and constraints to energy-efficient urban development. The relationship between energy and urban structure provides a framework for discussing the role of urban planning to increase energy efficiency in cities by means of three in-depth case studies of medium-sized cities in Northern Europe: Eskilstuna in Sweden, Turku in Finland and Tartu in Estonia. In some ways these cities go ahead when it comes to their national climate and energy policies and aim to establish urban planning as an instrument to regulate and influence the city's transition in a sustainable way. At the same time, the cities are constantly facing goal conflicts and limitations to their scope of action, which creates dilemmas in their strategic orientation and planning activities (e.g. regional enlargement and increased commuting vs. compact urban development). Finally, considering urban form and spatial structure along with the policy context as well as regional drivers and functional relations is suggested as a suitable approach for addressing the challenges of energy-efficient urban development.

J	Fudge, S; Peters, M				Fudge, Shane; Peters, Michael			Motivating carbon reduction in the UK: the role of local government as an agent of social change	JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES			English	Article						local agenda 21; climate change; governance; local authorities; community engagement		In UK policy circles, there is a growing recognition that mediating the interface between policy making and the public through local government led initiatives is one way through which to provide a practicable means to deliver carbon reduction at an individual, household, and community level. Following on from the aims of Local Agenda 21 in creating the space for a more bottom-up policy infrastructure, the 2007 UK Energy White Paper is one of the latest political statements to highlight the way in which reaching UK targets on CO2 emissions will continue to involve a greater local response to climate change. This emphasis was given further weight through the introduction of a new local performance framework in April 2008. This new set of 198 national performance indicators (PIs) for local government and other local bodies are now the only PIs which Central Government will use to assess local government performance. Importantly, they include three PIs that specifically cover the issue of climate change and carbon reduction (CLG 2007a). For many years, local authorities in the UK have played a role in encouraging more community led sustainable development objectives. However, what Giddens (2000) describes as the 'modernization' of local governance, has often proved to be inherently problematic, not least in developing the 'civic engagement' aspect of this model of governance. The article traces these problems in relation to the increasing responsibilities of local government in developing local community led responses to climate change. Although the UK Government continue to highlight the opportunities for this type of political framework in addressing the bottom-up complexities of climate change, we consider why some of the issues raised in three case study examples are indicative of wider problems in expanding this form of governance in the UK. The article concludes that difficulties encountered with regard to the implementation of LA 21's central objectives have extended through to the more recent focus for action in combating the specific challenge of climate change. More broadly, innovation in the sense of fostering an effective level of civic engagement in sustainable development objectives, continues to remain problematic.

Labor productivity in Russian companies: How to foster sustainable growth	ZHURNAL NOVAYA EKONOMICHESKAYA ASSOTSIATSIYA-JOURNAL OF THE NEW ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION			Russian	Article						labor productivity; basic non-resource industries; factors of productivity growth; investments in fixed assets; innovation; R&D; digital technology; human capital	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; FIRMS	In this paper, we study the factors, motivations and barriers for productivity growth in Russia. The data is based on a survey of 700 companies of Russian basic non-resource industries. We find inter- and intra-industry divergence of companies by labor productivity level and discuss the evidence for further divergence. Revealed are the factors of high labor productivity level, among which are scale of business, investments into fixed assets and human capital, application of modern digital technologies, export activity and training of employees. The growth of labor productivity is positively associated with firm size, investment activity, digitalization and R&D spending. There is no positive and significant impact of innovation activities on productivity level and its dynamics, which may be a result of low innovation intensity and time lags in effects of innovation activities on revenue. The evidence suggests that innovative firms with positive dynamics of innovation performance are followers of foreign competitors. We find that firms with the leading and lagging levels of labor productivity have different strategies for human capital accumulation. Leading firms combine significant staff turnover with intensive professional development of existing staff, while lagging in productivity firms are not involved in staff turnover and investment in training. While leading in productivity firms compete for the best personnel, lagging firms compete for financial resources. In addition, leading companies find among the highest the risks that qualified personnel would be diverted, while the lagging companies find among the highest the risks of employees' low motivation. Most of the leading in productivity firms are interested in continuous improvements of labor productivity, while among lagging in productivity firms this problem is important only for one fourth of them. Lack of internal motivation to improve their productivity may reflect failures in the corporate governance system. At the same time, the established model of relations with the state has a significant impact on the respective motivations of companies.	[Simachev, Yu, V; Kuzyk, M. G.; Fedyunina, A. A.; Yurevich, M.

A new concept, that of a sustainable Smart City, is already under discussion. This article aims at analyzing the Smart City concept in Romania. The resulting advantages, but also the difficulties and obstacles that need to be confronted, are considered when becoming a Smart City. When a city wants to become smart, it must consider both the advantages and the difficulties it will face in this endeavor. This paper has been able to take into account and group the four key features of a sustainable Smart City. The authors conducted research in two parts. The first consisted of conducting a comparative analysis of the most important results of Smart City projects implemented in the four reference cities in Romania compared to London. The second, a quantitative analysis, aimed to analyze the opinions and attitudes of Romanians regarding the Smart City concept in relation to sustainability. An important finding of the study shows that over half of the respondents are familiar with the Smart City concept and 41.9% consider health as a priority for investment in technology. The authors of the article propose clearer highlighting and division of cities from the point of view of creating a Smart City.

King Bhumibol: The Symbolic "Father of Water Resources Management" and Hydraulic Development Discourse in Thailand	ASIAN STUDIES REVIEW			English	Article						Thailand; King Bhumibol; water resources control; hydraulic development; symbolism; kingship; state-making	MONARCHY	The present Thai monarch's reputation in matters hydrological is an integral element of the mythology and symbolism that have characterised his reign. Royalists have carefully constructed the king as a semi-deified Father of Thai Water Management, Royal Rainmaker, wise inventor of hydraulic technology and planner of royal initiatives over a period of six decades. Yet, despite the links that are often drawn between water resources control, spiritual cosmology and political governance surrounding pre-modern Southeast Asian rulers, there has been surprisingly little critical scholarship undertaken on this contemporary aspect of kingship and state-making in Thailand. This paper examines the evolving discourse surrounding the monarchy and hydraulic development as a response to a perceived neglect regarding the central role of water in cementing the king's power and legitimacy. It argues that King Bhumibol's apparent hegemony in the national water resources governance paradigm has been an essential element underpinning the longevity and authority of his reign, partly facilitated through the workings of a network of allied strategic interests. Drawing from a range of sources, this paper makes a cautious start in addressing the subject and attempts to open up a space for further critical reflection and discussion regarding the significance of water resources control to Thailand's royal statecraft.				djhblake@yahoo.co.uk			Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of East Anglia	Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of East Anglia	The author gratefully acknowledges the intellectual guidance provided by his two PhD supervisors (Bruce Lankford and Thomas Sikor) at the School of International Development (DEV), University of East Anglia, in helping to develop a sound conceptual understanding of the complexities of societal power relations and the hydraulic control paradigm, from which this paper has drawn inspiration.

This paper presents the results of a study that evaluates capacity in relation to the health and water sectors in Vietnam. The study presents informants' views on the adequacy of financial resources, understanding of vulnerability and adaptation, training needs, information requirements and levels of cooperation as well as their priorities to address adaptation. The perceptions of respondents on challenges and obstacles faced in developing adaptation strategies are also examined. Training on vulnerability and increasing funds for adaptation were reported as the top priorities, indicating that the inadequacy of human and financial resources is the most significant challenge to effective adaptation in the study context. Difficult and weak cooperation was also widely considered to be a barrier. The paper concludes that there are significant interconnected constraints on adaptive capacity in Vietnam that are further exacerbated by governance issues, such as inadequate cooperation and transparency in sharing information and data. This paper identifies priorities for action to address the challenge of climate change adaptation.

In this paper, we contribute to this movement regarding the conception of stakeholder agency within social-ecological systems. We examine primary evidence from the governance of post-disaster recovery and disaster risk reduction efforts in Thailand's coastal tourism-dependent communities following the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. Through an emerging storyline from stakeholders, we construct a new framework for conceptualising stakeholder agency in social-ecological systems, which positions the notion of resilience within a conception of governance as a negotiated normative process. We conclude that if resilience theory is proposed as the preferred approach by which disaster risk reduction is framed and implemented, it needs to acknowledge much more explicitly the role of stakeholder agency and the processes through which legitimate visions of resilience are generated.

We argue that this focus can be usefully extended to agricultural production and to wider territorial processes occurring in rural areas. In this study, we examine the development of a grassroots movement demanding stricter municipal regulation of agricultural pesticide use and support for a more sustainable and localised agri-food system. The study site, located in the north-eastern Italian Alps, has in recent years been characterized by the spread of intensive agriculture, particularly due to the expansion of vineyards. Our conceptual framework brings together the literature on food democracy and just sustainability transitions, seen from a territorial perspective. We use this framework to examine the role played by civil society organisations and alternative food networks in municipal and territorial agri-food system governance. The results show how the grassroots anti-pesticide mobilisation played a key role in reforming municipal pesticide regulations and in slowing down the spread of intensive agriculture in the province. We also draw attention to the framings used by activists to gain the support of public opinion and local administrators. Finally, we discuss the role played by different forms of food democracy processes in facilitating the emergence of a territorial vision of just sustainability transitions.

Case Study of Selected Cultural Routes in Poland	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						cultural routes; trust; cooperation networks; cultural heritage management	SOCIAL NETWORK; INTERPERSONAL-TRUST; TOURISM; JUSTICE; TRUSTWORTHINESS; PERFORMANCE; GOVERNANCE; SUPPORT; SYSTEM; IMPACT	Currently, the most common way of managing cultural heritage in a sustainable manner takes the form of cultural routes. The phenomenon of cultural routes mainly results from their innovative organisation, different from the previously adopted institutionalised and formalised heritage management structure that did not align with the contemporary discourse around cultural heritage, which currently constitutes one of the bases of sustainable development. The novel idea focuses on the active involvement of many diverse entities in heritage management: not only public sector organisations with their statutory appointment for this purpose, but, first and foremost, entrepreneurs who create heritage products, tourists visiting sites on the route, or people who create this heritage. Thus, the cultural route acquires the characteristics of a network-points (nodes) that are shaped depending on the needs of the region and its inhabitants, their knowledge, experience, current ideas about a given place, and the way in which specific communities would like to be perceived. The undertaken research problem explores what features cultural route networks have and how they are managed, as well as what values, including trust, are manifested in the mutual relations of route-related entities. An original concept of shaping trust within the network of cultural routes has also been proposed based on the research results.

While traditionally these two challenges were addressed separately, recently, papers have begun to specifically address the nexus of food security and biodiversity conservation. We conducted a structured literature review of 91 papers addressing this nexus. To ascertain how a given paper approached the topic, we assessed to what extent it covered 68 potentially relevant issues. The resulting dataset was analyzed using cluster analysis. Two main branches of literature, containing a total of six clusters of papers, were identified. The "biophysical-technical" branch (clusters: "sustainable intensification" and "production focus") was dominated by the natural sciences, focused strongly on the production aspect of food security, and sought general solutions. In contrast, the "social-political" branch (clusters: "social-ecological development"; "empowerment for food security"; "agroecology and food sovereignty"; and "social-ecological systems") often drew on the social sciences and emphasized social relations and governance, alongside broader considerations of sustainability and human well-being. While the biophysical-technical branch was often global in focus, much of the social-political branch focused on specific localities. Two clusters of papers, one from each branch, stood out as being particularly broad in scope-namely the clusters on "sustainable intensification" and "agroecology and food sovereignty." Despite major differences in their conceptual basis, we argue that exchange between these two research clusters could be particularly helpful in generating insights on the food-biodiversity nexus that are both generally applicable and sufficiently nuanced to capture key system-specific variables.

Civil-military relations: a review of major guidelines and their relevance during public health emergencies	BMJ MILITARY HEALTH			English	Review						health services administration & management; clinical governance; health policy; international health services; organisation of health services; protocols & guidelines		The operational and policy complexity of civil-military relations (CMR) during public health emergencies, especially those involving militaries from outside the state concerned, is addressed in several guiding international documents. Generally, these documents reflect humanitarian perspectives and doctrine at the time of their drafting, and primarily address foreign military involvement in natural and humanitarian disasters. However, in the past decade, there have been significant changes in the geopolitical environment and global health landscapes. Foreign militaries have been increasingly deployed to public health emergencies with responses grounded in public health (rather than humanitarian) approaches, while public health issues are of increasing importance in other deployments. This paper reviews key international policy documents that regulate, guide or otherwise inform CMR in the context of recent events involving international CMR during public health emergency responses, grounded in analysis of a March 2017 Chatham House roundtable event on the subject. Major thematic concerns regarding the application of existing CMR guiding documents to public health emergencies became evident. These include a lack of consideration of public health factors as distinct from a humanitarian approach; the assertion of state sovereignty vis-a-vis the deployment of national militaries; the emergence of new armed, military and security groups and a lack of consensus surrounding the 'principle of last resort'. These criticisms and gaps-in particular, a consideration for public health contexts and approaches therein-should form the basis of future CMR drafting or revision processes to ensure effective, safe, and sustainable CMR during public health emergency response.

Dadley			Relationships between Livelihoods, Well-Being, and Marine Protected Areas: Evidence from a Community Survey, Watamu Marine National Park and Reserve, Kenya	COASTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Conservation; governance; protected areas; well-being	MIDA CREEK; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; MANGROVE FORESTS; LOCAL PEOPLE; CONSERVATION; MANAGEMENT; BIODIVERSITY; PERCEPTIONS; GOVERNANCE; BENEFITS	At a time of massive expansion of Marine Protected Areas, there is a need to learn more about their sustainability and success. This study draws on a framework which operationalizes three-dimensions of well-being: material, relational, and subjective, in order to measure the range of benefits and disbenefits experienced by local communities from protected areas. 308 respondents from two coastal Kenyan villages adjacent to the Watamu Marine National Reserve participated in a telephone survey in June and July 2020. The study recorded varying levels of dependency on the marine environment for the livelihoods of residents. A key finding of this study was that benefits reported by participants consistently exceeded disbenefits. A principal components analysis identified that the number of benefits and disbenefits experienced explained the most variance within the dataset. The benefits and disbenefits reported contributed to each dimension of human well-being. The highest ranked benefits reported contributed to subjective well-being ('better health', and 'ability to enjoy a clean and healthy creek and ocean'), and the most frequently reported disbenefits related to relational and material well-being (for instance 'increased conflict and social tension' 'increased poverty', 'fewer supplies of food'). Practical local conservation efforts can address relational disbenefits through better partnership working, and material disbenefits by supporting pro-conservation, alternative livelihoods. The findings demonstrate the relevance of understanding social trends for marine protected area governance and management. The paper offers insights into how fundamental relations between protected marine environments, livelihoods, and well-being may affect the perceptions and success of conservation initiatives amongst local communities.

J	Campbell, H; Rosin, C; Hunt, L; Fairweather, J				Campbell, Hugh; Rosin, Christopher; Hunt, Lesley; Fairweather, John			The social practice of sustainable agriculture under audit discipline: Initial insights from the ARGOS project in New Zealand	JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES			English	Article						Agriculture; Organic; Integrated management; GLOBALGAP; Audit; Sustainability; Social dynamics; Farm households; ARGOS project; Transdisciplinarity; New Zealand	ORGANIC AGRICULTURE; FARMERS; STANDARDS; PARTICIPATION; CERTIFICATION; ORIENTATIONS; CONVENTIONS; GOVERNANCE; TRANSITION; PARADIGMS	One of the most interesting recent developments in global agri-food systems has been the rapid emergence and elaboration of market audit systems claiming environmental qualities or sustainability. In New Zealand, as a strongly export-oriented, high-value food producer, these environmental market audit systems have emerged as an important pathway for producers to potentially move towards more sustainable production. There have, however, been only sporadic and fractured attempts to study the emerging social practice of sustainable agriculture - particularly in terms of the emergence of new audit disciplines in farming. The ARGOS project in New Zealand was established in 2003 as a longitudinal matched panel study of over 100 farms and orchards using different market audit systems (e.g., organic, integrated or GLOBALG.A.P.). This article reports on the results of social research into the social practice of sustainable agriculture in farm households within the ARGOS projects between 2003 and 2009. Results drawn from multiple social research instruments deployed over six years provide an unparalleled level of empirical data on the social practice of sustainable agriculture under audit disciplines. Using 12 criteria identified in prior literature as contributing a significant social dynamic around sustainable agriculture practices in other contexts, the analysis demonstrated that 9 of these 12 dimensions did demonstrate differences in social practices emerging between (or co-constituting) organic. integrated, or conventional audit disciplines. These differences clustered into three main areas: 1) social and learning/knowledge networks and expertise, 2) key elements of farmer subjectivity - particularly in relation to subjective positioning towards the environment and nature, and 3) the role and importance of environmental dynamics within farm management practices and systems. The findings of the project provide a strong challenge to some older framings of the social practice of sustainable agriculture: particularly those that rely on paradigm-driven evaluation of social motivations, strong determinism of sustainable practice driven by coherent farmer identity, or deploying overly categorical interpretations of what it means to be 'organic' or 'conventional'. The complex patterning of the ARGOS data can only be understood if the social practice of organic, integrated or (even more loosely) conventional production is understood as being co-produced by four dynamics: subjectivity/identity, audit disciplines, industry cultures/structure and time. This reframing of how we might research the social practice of sustainable agriculture opens up important new opportunities for understanding the emergence and impact of new audit disciplines in agriculture.

GBD 2015 SDG Collaborators	Measuring the health-related Sustainable Development Goals in 188 countries: a baseline analysis from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015	LANCET			English	Article							SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS; NATIONAL INCIDENCE; MENTAL-HEALTH; MORTALITY; PROGRESS; OFFLINE; MALARIA; MANAGEMENT; HIV; SDG	Background In September, 2015, the UN General Assembly established the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs specify 17 universal goals, 169 targets, and 230 indicators leading up to 2030. We provide an analysis of 33 health-related SDG indicators based on the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015). Methods We applied statistical methods to systematically compiled data to estimate the performance of 33 health-related SDG indicators for 188 countries from 1990 to 2015. We rescaled each indicator on a scale from 0 (worst observed value between 1990 and 2015) to 100 (best observed). Indices representing all 33 health-related SDG indicators (health-related SDG index), health-related SDG indicators included in the Millennium Development Goals (MDG index), and health-related indicators not included in the MDGs (non-MDG index) were computed as the geometric mean of the rescaled indicators by SDG target. We used spline regressions to examine the relations between the Socio-demographic Index (SDI, a summary measure based on average income per person, educational attainment, and total fertility rate) and each of the health-related SDG indicators and indices. Findings In 2015, the median health-related SDG index was 59.3 (95% uncertainty interval 56.8-61.8) and varied widely by country, ranging from 85.5 (84.2-86.5) in Iceland to 20.4 (15.4-24.9) in Central African Republic. SDI was a good predictor of the health-related SDG index (r(2) = 0.88) and the MDG index (r(2) = 0.92), whereas the non-MDG index had a weaker relation with SDI (r(2) = 0.79). Between 2000 and 2015, the health-related SDG index improved by a median of 7.9 (IQR 5.0-10.4), and gains on the MDG index (a median change of 10.0 [6.7-13.1]) exceeded that of the nonMDG index (a median change of 5.5 [2.1-8.9]). Since 2000, pronounced progress occurred for indicators such as met need with modern contraception, under-5 mortality, and neonatal mortality, as well as the indicator for universal health coverage tracer interventions. Moderate improvements were found for indicators such as HIV and tuberculosis incidence, minimal changes for hepatitis B incidence took place, and childhood overweight considerably worsened. Interpretation GBD provides an independent, comparable avenue for monitoring progress towards the health-related SDGs. Our analysis not only highlights the importance of income, education, and fertility as drivers of health improvement but also emphasises that investments in these areas alone will not be sufficient. Although considerable progress on the health-related MDG indicators has been made, these gains will need to be sustained and, in many cases, accelerated to achieve the ambitious SDG targets. The minimal improvement in or worsening of health-related indicators beyond the MDGs highlight the need for additional resources to effectively address the expanded scope of the health-related SDGs.

J	Korosteleva, E				Korosteleva, Elena			Putting the EU Global Security Strategy to test: 'cooperative orders' and othering in EU-Russia relations	INTERNATIONAL POLITICS			English	Article						European Union; Global Security Strategy; Russia; Othering; Governance; Hegemony; Cooperative orders		This paper examines the notion of othering and its role in the development of cooperative regional orders, prioritised by the EU Global Security Strategy. It argues that the conceptual underpinnings of the relationship between the inside and the outside, the established Self and the emergent Other, are too often taken for granted and in a fragmenting global order require urgent re-conceptualisation. Drawing on post-structuralist and Freudian work, the paper contends that while living in an increasingly complex and contested world, it is imperative to develop a more nuanced understanding of a changing global order as relational and interdependent. This would require a new conceptualisation of othering as a reciprocal nexus (rather than an opposition or even juxtaposition) between the Self and the Other, to ensure that cooperative orders would form and become sustainable.

J	Winterford, K				Winterford, Keren			A positive notion of power for citizen voice and state accountability	DEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE			English	Article						Aid - Accountability; Aid effectiveness; Development policies; Civil society - Participation; Governance and public policy		This article explores the notion of power within citizen-state relations. A positive notion of power is presented as an addition to evolving development discourse which has predominantly defined power as a finite resource transferred from state to citizen in a process of "changing the balance of power''. A positive notion of power is concerned with maximising and connecting citizen power and affirming state power, for synergistic change. The article draws on development discourse and practical examples to outline a positive notion of power, prioritising relational dialogue and joint citizen state action for development outcomes.

J	Settle, AC				Settle, Antonia C.			The new development paradigm through the lens of the Aga Khan Rural Support Programme: legitimacy, accountability and the political sphere	COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT JOURNAL			English	Article							AID; GOVERNANCE	This article critically reviews the Aga Khan Rural Support Programme (AKRSP) in light of Joseph Stiglitzs onew development paradigm' (NDP). Based on the analysis of the pioneering participatory development strategies applied by the AKRSP in Gilgit-Baltistan, Northern Pakistan, the NDP is used to highlight a number of issues. I argue that an emphasis on social legitimacy and the political sphere as a realm for political debate and action can clarify relationships between funders, projects and communities, and contribute to the ground assessment of the impacts of the AKRSP on local communities. Raising issues about accountability and transparency, and questioning the robustness of political relations towards which the NDP works, I conclude that the AKRSPs participatory development model may, contrary to the rhetoric of empowerment inherent to the concept of participatory development, in fact lead to the effective weakening of political rights.

As a result, when these institutionally set targets conflict with pre-existing rules and norms in implementing states, implementation difficulties may result, as one can currently observe with regard to IWRM and SDG 6.5. Governance challenges that result from implementation gaps are often filled at the local level, where actors arrange for functional management processes despite institutional insecurity. Applying institutional bricolage theory, we investigate such processes for South Africa, Mongolia and Peru, focusing on how horizontal and vertical coordination, as well as participation, are achieved as key aspects of IWRM. By adopting an analytical frame focusing on institutions, discourses and power relations based on Frances Cleaver's bricolage dimensions, we show how their governance and management arrangements have evolved. In the process of comparing the three cases, we consider what conclusions can be drawn from these arrangements with regard to facilitating institutional transfer processes. Our study shows that informal aspects of governance systems powerfully influence the interpretation of newly introduced policies. We find that efforts to implement international blueprints that neglect institutional legacies, sociocultural dynamics, and pre-existing inequalities are unlikely to result in arrangements that are suited to local realities.

Blueprinting refers to a process that brings together planning experts, local political leaders, and ordinary citizens; arms them with current planning ideas about smart growth and data visualization tools, to develop long-range regional development plans. As such, blueprinting represents a recent manifestation of regionalist approaches to environmental policy and planning. Focusing on the Sacramento region, an early adopter of blueprint planning, we use archival data and media sources to reconstruct the development of blueprinting and then we turn to an analysis of the performance of the blueprinting approach in relation to three successive planning efforts. We find that despite the promise of blueprinting, very little progress has been made toward actually changing the regional transportation system and land use patterns. The net result of this long-term planning effort aimed at achieving sustainable transportation land use is that total CO2 emissions increase over time at historical rates. We close with a discussion of what this means for regional planning and achieving goals set by California's landmark climate change legislation.				rtgrattet@ucdavis.edu							36	12	12	0	24	SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD	LONDON	1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND	0263-774X	1472-3425		ENVIRON PLANN C	Environ.

Challenges in the management of small-scale marine fisheries conflicts in Ghana	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Sustainable fishing; Overfishing; Resource depletion; Conflict; Management; Food security		Marine fisheries play important socio-economic roles in Ghana including the provision of food, livelihoods, employment, income generation and poverty reduction. Small-scale fisheries in Ghana face many management challenges such as overfished stocks, and user conflicts which can threaten resource sustainability and social stability. Previous research on conflict management in Ghanaian fisheries in 2001, gave a view of conflicts at that time. Since then, the institutional arrangements for fisheries management have developed, but there have also been other pressures from overfishing, population growth and the development of a national oil industry. This paper identifies previous studies and conducts participatory research interviews with a range of stakeholders to determine current fishery conflicts, their causes, consequences and their management. Different types of conflicts were identified which include, spatial, fishing gear, resource competition, and a range of governance and interagency conflicts. Conflicts among fishers have negative impacts on economic and social development. Unfortunately, the decline in fish production due to overfishing precipitates some of the conflict issues. It is concluded that fisheries governance of the small-scale fisheries sector can be enhanced, if fish production declines are addressed, open access canoe fisheries are restricted, management of pre-mix fuel administration and distribution improved, with the subsidy on the commodity being gradually removed. Fishery regulations can be enhanced, fisheries arbitration systems strengthened and fishers made more aware of fisheries laws through education via co-management. However, given the extensive changes envisaged and the time required to reduce levels of fishing effort, it is essential that co-management governance structures and relations among small-scale fishers keep improving, so as to contain the level of conflict in Ghana's fisheries in the transition to more sustainable fishing and food security.

J	Jacobsson, D				Jacobsson, Diana			In the Name of (Un) Sustainability: A Critical Analysis of How Neoliberal Ideology Operates Through Discourses About Sustainable Progress and Equality	TRIPLEC-COMMUNICATION CAPITALISM & CRITIQUE			English	Article						sustainability; ideology; neoliberalism; media	SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY; CITY-REGIONS; POLITICS; GOVERNANCE; DEMOCRACY; POWER	This article examines sustainable development discourses while addressing the unsustainable structures within which these discourses take place. The main research question concerns how sustainability is understood in relation to class and capitalism and what ideologies are expressed as neutral in the anodyne context of public information. Critical discourse analysis is applied as a method to examine how sustainable development is shaped through the construction of problems, responsibilities and solutions in a Swedish municipal magazine. The analysis reveals two parallel constructions: hyper-politicised discourses about free enterprise and a trivialisation of discourses about socio-economic challenges. Texts about social care and social responsibility are represented in the form of banal politics, transforming conflict into consensus, while stories about the business sector rely heavily on market rationales stressing the importance of political intervention to increase the attractive power of entrepreneurialism. Taking Critical Theory as its starting point, the analysis discusses the neoliberal paradox, namely that in the neoliberal political regime, despite the rhetoric of individualism and freedom, the role of the state is to support private enterprises. The article argues that the role of communication needs further analytical attention to increase our understanding of how sustainability is shaped and established in mainstream public discourse. It concludes that the specific communication practice examined here promotes neoliberal capitalism by encouraging the continued unsustainable class structuring of our society.

Specifically, 1 question the extent to which TAAFNs are based on (I) objective and effective governance, (2) partnership, and (3) democracy and morality. This article concludes that producers and consumers need to develop closer and more substantial relations, if TAAFNs are to generate meaningful and lasting development. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Gazzola, P; Bonifazi, A; Rinaldi, A				Gazzola, Paola; Bonifazi, Alessandro; Rinaldi, Alessandro			Mapping power relations in SEA - The role of statutory environmental consultees. An Italian case-study	ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW			English	Article						SEA; Legitimacy; Knowledge claims; Power; Relational complexity; Statutory environmental consultees	IMPACT ASSESSMENT; GOVERNANCE; ADVOCACY; SCIENCE; SUSTAINABILITY; LEGITIMATION; REFLECTIONS; SCIENTISTS; NEUTRALITY; APPRAISAL	Since its very inception in the late decades of the twentieth century, environmental assessment (EA) has been imbued with a complex interplay of power, knowledge and values. Despite instrumental rationality seemingly dominating current practices, actors are faced with growing relational complexity and seem to be slowly becoming increasingly mindful of political, social and cultural implications of EA. Within this context, this paper explores the role of statutory environmental consultees in strategic environmental assessment (SEA), by reflecting on issues of power among the different actors involved, the handling of values and the generation, use and exchange of knowledge in SEA processes. The authors adopted a framework for contemporary environmental governance to map actors' strategies onto a conceptual space stretching along two directions: the polarization between confrontational and collaborative attitudes, and the tendency to underpin knowledge claims with factual evidence or subjective considerations. By dwelling on a case study concerning the SEA of a national programme to promote sustainable urban development in metropolitan areas in Italy, the use of objectivity to support either neutrality- or advocacy-oriented approaches is contrasted with the use of strategies where statutory consultees have shown more adaptive and confrontational behaviours - that hinge upon both political and scientific legitimacy - to pursue their particular organizational strategies agendas.

J	Kirat, M				Kirat, Mohamed			Corporate social responsibility in the oil and gas industry in Qatar perceptions and practices	PUBLIC RELATIONS REVIEW			English	Article						Corporate social responsibility; Perceptions and practices; Environment and society; Sustainable development; Stakeholders; Community involvement; Corporate citizenship		In the last few years, the state of Qatar paid a great attention to corporate social responsibility (CSR) to face a score of challenges namely sustainable development, globalization, governance, corporate sector impact, communications, finance, ethics among others. Through in depth interviews and the analysis of companies' websites and annual CSR reports, this study looked at the perceptions and practices of CSR in Qatar. Findings of the study suggest that Qatar oil and gas companies engage in corporate social responsibility activities focusing on health, sports, education and environment, while neglecting other important areas such as human rights, labor rights, work conditions, anti-bribery and anti-corruption measures. They perform no research and assessments before or after they engage in CSR activities. CSR should be enforced by law, and implemented according to international standards in order to improve its performance and to meet local and international challenges. With barely a decade of practice and experience, CSR in Qatar oil and gas industry is developing fast and has to move to the next step where the focus should be given to developing policies and strategies, and through institutionalizing it.

Economics and governance of district cooling	ECOSYSTEMS AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT VI	WIT TRANSACTIONS ON ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT		English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Ecosystems and Sustainable Development	SEP 05-07, 2007	Coimbra, PORTUGAL	Wessex Inst Technol, Univ Coimbra, Univ Siena, WIT Transact Ecol & Environm		district heating; district cooling; energy efficiency; environmental cost-benefit analysis; energy externalities		Energy use outlook in developed countries shows a particularly fast growing component: the demand for cooling. This demand of energy for indoor air conditioning represents a challenge for environmental policies, a potential enemy of energy efficiency and energy saving and, definitely, an issue at stake for global climate policies. The trend of energy demand for cooling purposes also brings many problems for the generation capacity and the management of peak loads. The technologies for centralized trigeneration (electricity, heating, cooling) seem promising but do not always enter the market with convincing commercial strategies. Nevertheless, the presence of district heating from cogeneration plants in large metropolitan areas (like in Turin, Italy) represent the possibility of developing district conditioning. The preliminary conclusions of the research are as follows: 1) given the assumed technology and the trend for indoor air-conditioning demand, district cooling brings net social benefits from both sides of industrial figures (global investments, maintenance and running costs) and environmental externalities; 2) some cautionary remarks are due in relation to the assumptions, sometimes questionable, about emissions rate per kWh, energy efficiency in electricity production, discount rate, market prices of alternative technologies, plumbing and networking costs. The analysis does not encompass the distribution of costs and benefits among stakeholders (among the others: electricity producers, network owners, end users), a question that is more relevant in the political local arena.											7	1	1	1	4	WIT PRESS	SOUTHAMPTON	ASHURST LODGE, SOUTHAMPTON SO40 7AA, ASHURST, ENGLAND	1746-448X		978-1-84564-088-0	WIT TRANS ECOL ENVIR			2007	106						263	272						10	Ecology; Environmental Sciences	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Environmental Sciences & Ecology	BHN35		Bronze			2022-12-14	WOS:000254475600025

This new situation calls for a fundamental shift in perspectives, world views, and institutions. Human development and progress must be reconnected to the capacity of the biosphere and essential ecosystem services to be sustained. Governance challenges include a highly interconnected and faster world, cascading social-ecological interactions and planetary boundaries that create vulnerabilities but also opportunities for social-ecological change and transformation. Tipping points and thresholds highlight the importance of understanding and managing resilience. New modes of flexible governance are emerging. A central challenge is to reconnect these efforts to the changing preconditions for societal development as active stewards of the Earth System. We suggest that the Millennium Development Goals need to be reframed in such a planetary stewardship context combined with a call for a new social contract on global sustainability.

The economic activity of social entrepreneurs is presumed altruistic, their actions intending to primarily benefit others. The theoretical and actual motivations, social networks and values of these actors are compared in this article. A series of semi-structured interviews of prominent social entrepreneurs in the west of England form the basis of analysis. Subjects were selected through a nomination-referral technique that allows targeting for interview those who are considered prominent in the sector within the chosen location. Two types of analysis are attempted: a narrative exploration of their motivations and a semantic networks analysis of their statements. There is evidence of a conceptual association between those actors' success, entrepreneurship, motivation and social relations that indicate profitable avenues for future research. Some policy recommendations are offered in the conclusion. The multiple roles of social entrepreneurs and the multiple audiences they address indicate multidimensional agency. The development of the sector depends on comprehending conflict inherent in their multiple agendas.

National and supranational legislation and policy-making, however, focus on governance frameworks established by State and market actors. Consequently, development planning often ignores farmers' rationality regarding sustainable water control. This paper's literature research examines how the notion of 'hydraulic property creation' in contexts of legal pluralism may support sustainable, self-governed irrigation systems. User-investment in hydraulic infrastructure generates collective water property relations. This socio-natural foundation of farmer-managed systems embeds (materializes) and entwines collective and individual water rights in hydraulic works, triggering collective action. Being fundamental to sustainable management, even well-intended policies and legislation ignoring this practice-based property notion may jeopardize well-functioning systems.

J	Fritz, JS				Fritz, JS			Earthwatch twenty-five years on - Between science and international environmental governance	INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS			English	Article								The United Nations system is complex and its workings often seem muddled to the outside observer. The UN has struggled with this problem from its inception, sometimes successfully but often not Part of the difficulty lies in the increasing complexity of the issues being addressed internationally, including "sustainable development" The expectations raised by such an all-encompassing term are hardly achievable in immediate terms. This lack of clarity in the issues addressed through the UN is also reflected in its institutional structures. The story of Earthwatch is just one example of how the UN has attempted to bring clarity into its system. In this case, the aim was to bring together the most up-to-date scientific knowledge and make it policy-relevant on an ongoing basis. What seemed a relatively straightforward goal has instead been fraught with difficulties. In this article, I analyze these difficulties in terms of the relations between science and policymaking. Three distinct conceptual approaches have been taken to this relationship: the functional approach, the feeder-of-information approach, and the assessments-for-policy approach. Each has had a decisive influence on the practices of Earthwatch. I conclude that the most recent approach offers the best alternative to realizing Earthwatch's goal. However, much work remains to be done. To this end I suggest that further research is needed.

J	Ndaguba, EA; Hanyane, B				Ndaguba, Emeka Austin; Hanyane, Barry			Conceptualizing community economic development strategic framework for poverty alleviation: The case of Raymond Mhlaba Local Municipality	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS			English	Article								Economic regeneration is a segment of neighbourhood renewal that boosts community economics and sustains certain principles of sustainable urbanization. The community economic development framework for poverty reduction, the implementation loop for stakeholder collaboration, and the Neo-Marxist community economic development strategy for local economic freedom are imperative for sustaining and renewing the idealism of shared prosperity, which is the basis of collectivism and community economic development in relation to community development. Because, where there is poor economic vivacity; it is difficult, if not impossible for such community to galvanize towards the realisation of the sustainable development agenda, is tied to economic vivacity of an area. It is on this ground that this paper develops a neighbourhood regeneration model or the community economic development strategic framework for poverty alleviation for the Raymond Mhlaba Local Municipality. Data were sorted from Statistics South Africa, ScienceDirect, EBSCOHost, Proquest, and Scopus among others, and the data were cushioned with substantial qualitative analysis. Triangulation, content, and theme analysis were used to analysis the data and propose the models for the paper. It must be noted that an understanding and appreciation of this paper is dependent on the understanding of the earlier papers advanced in this series. Finding demonstrates the suitability and the need for models in empowering those at the rural areas in South Africa.

Our toolkit allows us to assess the effectiveness of management decisions in the implementation of the "smart city" concept and to carry out continuous public-private monitoring of the effectiveness of innovations in implementing smart PPP projects. To this end, we propose and justify a new indicator of the effectiveness of managerial decision-making, taking into account the quality of the information received during the implementation of innovative PPP projects, which allows calculating the degree of utilization of the potential capabilities of a company participating in a PPP.

The current body of literature usually focuses on food security, especially in relation to production and waste management in the supply chain. The food service sector (FSS), a major consumer-facing component of the food system, has often been overlooked or neglected. There exists, then, an opportunity to better understand the interlinkages between food waste, energy, water, and emissions -the FEWE Nexus -to assist this sector in developing more sustainable operations, such as kitchen equipment management and menu development. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel FEWE Nexus Framework, to understand the flow of nexus components associated with receiving, storing, preparing, cooking, cleaning, and serving menu items. A key aspect of the methodological approach for FEWE evaluation is life cycle assessment (LCA). This is embodied in a comprehensive nexus audit tool comprising several indicators to monitor and quantify energy and water consumption, emissions from cooking, food waste generated, and type and efficiency of equipment used. Further, a stakeholder engagement survey is integrated, allowing for stakeholder feedback on applications of the audit tool, and to assess the impacts and acceptance of potential interventions. Finally, we describe how an iterative nexus approach can enable decision makers in the FSS to robustly estimate nexus components and establish a baseline to track their progress towards minimizing wastages and maximize efficiency.

This article focuses on the evolution of mature tourism destinations, taking the path dependency concept forward from the notion of path creation into the new domain of path plasticity. Drawing on the notion of cultural political economy, we examine how tourism destinations can break with path dependency routines incrementally and move steadily towards different future paths, which may recast tourism in a different light in the overall urban context of the destination. Using a case study of a Mediterranean coastal destination on Catalonia's Costa Daurada, we explore the inter-tangled tourism and urban development processes in relation to the socio-spatial dimensions of urban change. The article argues for a wider range of social and cultural criteria in the analysis of tourism evolution - advocating the use of path plasticity and a cultural political economy approach - to offer an alternative perspective on shifting tourism situations, reflecting the inherently urbanising nature of tourism development in the traditional coastal resort context. It adds to the growing literature on governance and strategy-making in sustainable tourism.

J	Mutabdzija, G				Mutabdzija, Goran			SARAJEVO-ROMANIJA REGION: A FLUID SPACE BETWEEN THE RURAL AND URBAN	EUROPEAN COUNTRYSIDE			English	Article						Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH); Republic of Srpska (RS); East Sarajevo; urbanization; nodality; urban-rural relations		In this paper, emphasis is placed on the complexity of rural-urban relations and their reflection on the important socio-geographical processes, from de-agrarian and migration to the creation of new settlements and strengthening nodality individual centres. A clear polarization in urban and rural areas is more difficult due to the lack of adequate statistical indicators or deployment of institutions with different degree of importance, population density and distance from major city, providing sufficiently clear evidence of the degree of urbanity of local communities. This can be best seen in the Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) which is sparsely populated country with an average of 74 inhabitants/km2. Since there is a clear correlation between this indicator and sustainable development, increasing urbanization rates, which can stimulate economic growth and reduce poverty, is set as the primary social objective. Many developing countries looking for a way better governance of rural-urban relations, as one of the elements of inclusive growth, as a crucial element in the development of any society through innovation (industry) and harmonious territorial relations (urban-rural). Since BiH has a negative historical heritage but also unfavourable indicators of the degree of urbanization (40%), macroeconomic stability (29% of the GDP of the EU average) and the degree of innovation (44% compared to Switzerland) it is clear that should be analyzed and rural-urban relations as one of the signposts along the way of creating a better and healthier society.

The article theoretically analyzes the necessity of making changes in decision-making process on regulating entrepreneurship during the reforms in the state governance model. Directions of relationships between civil servants and entrepreneurs, mechanisms of conflict of interests have been clarified. Various approaches to the degree of involvement of entrepreneurs, civil servants and political leaders in decision making affecting entrepreneurial activity, the stages of sequencing the decision-making process, and the opportunities and freedoms granted to civil servants in the decision-making process has been analyzed. The role of human factor in decision-making process, the requirements of the administrative management apparatus, the existing problems in assessing the implementation of decisions has been explained, the systematic approach and the difficulties encountered in the use of situational analysis methods have been indicated. The complexity of grouping existing attitudes and relationships in various structures of the administrative management system, the effects of decisions and goals of the sub-divisions in public bodies on the decision and purpose of the overall state, and the shortcomings that arise during the execution have been identified. In the research process, attention was paid to the experience of different developed countries, comparative analysis, logical summarization and grouping, synthesis methods have been used. Recommendations on improving effectiveness in public administration were put forward, practical proposals were made regarding the preparation, acceptance, implementation and monitoring of enforcement of decisions within the competence of state bodies belonging to the civil service system.

(REAL CORP 2018)	Proceedings of International Conference on Urban Development Regional Planning and Information Society		English	Proceedings Paper	23rd International Conference on Urban and Regional Development and Spatial Planning in the Information Society (REAL CORP)	APR 04-06, 2018	Vienna Univ Technol, Campus Gusshaus, Vienna, AUSTRIA		Vienna Univ Technol, Campus Gusshaus	makeathon; public space; digitisation; urban planning; co-creation		In the face of the trend towards digitization, the consensus that successful urban solutions shall collectively be conceived and developed as a societal task is becoming increasingly present (Sorensen & Torfing, 2016). As we cannot elude the digitization of our built surroundings and everyday lives, we can make use of technology in a way that cities become more livable for the individual and address overarching goals such as sustainability and resilience. In addition to a variety of conventional and innovative participation methods, digital tools create options for integrating local actors into decision-making and implementation processes relevant to urban development. But what do new integrated approaches look like? How is it ensured that the impulses of a heterogeneous stakeholder landscape are equally respected? And how can cities commit to incorporating the results created in open ideation processes within traditional urban planning? In order to develop new and successful solutions to existing problems, co-creation focuses on the cooperation of transdisciplinary actors who jointly address challenges in a "process of creation" (Dork & Monteye, 2011). In this context, practical experience is considered as equally valuable as expertise knowledge and specialized skills. Thus, regardless of professional backgrounds, in such a co-creation process solutions are developed at eye level, from the initial idea to the (prototype) implementation. In relation to the wide variety of urban challenges we are currently facing, co-creation approaches offer a new format for stakeholder participation in urban development processes. Moreover, they promise the creation of holistic and sustainable (systems') solutions with a great innovative potential (Mulder, 2014). This paper is based on the projetct "City of the Future Ludwigsburg << which is funded by the German Ministry of Research and Education (BMBF) as part of the >> Flagship Initiative City of the Future". Within this initiative, local stakeholders, communities, businesses, the creative industries, civil society representatives and the scientific community cooperate in Ludwigsburg in order to implement processes and recommendations for action in Germany's future cities. As part of the three-phase tendering, in the city of Ludwigsburg the first phase focused on the joint development of a comprehensive concept for the planning and implementation of a sustainable and holistic vision 2030+. Against this background, currently phase two addresses digitization and urban space amongst others by hosting three consecutive events in the so-called "Makeathon" format. They address the future of urban space and urban development with a focus on digital solutions. To carry out these events, a workshop space was implemented which is called "urban laboratory" (Stadtlabor). Within this lab innovative ideas and possible measures for "upgrading" public space are identified and evaluated with regard to their overall benefits and their potential to improve their quality (Stadtverwaltung Ludwigsburg, 2018). The aim of the joint research project between Fraunhofer TAO and the city of Ludwigsburg is to test the structured co-creation process as a new governance format. Thus, impulses with regards to content and processes can be given for the city administration and politics, that flow into strategies as well as plans.

J	Verma, R; Ura, K				Verma, Ritu; Ura, Karma			Gender differences in gross national happiness: Analysis of the first nationwide wellbeing survey in Bhutan	WORLD DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						GNH; Bhutan; Development; Alternatives; Wellbeing; Gender; Equality	FABLES; MYTHS	At a moment when market-oriented, techno-centric and consumption-led approaches prevail in response to otherwise complex socio-cultural and political-economic realities, innovative concepts from Bhutan present an alternative bearing on equitable, sustainable and holistic development. Elaborated in the 1970 s by the 4th King of Bhutan, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, GNH is encoded in Bhutan's constitution, the driving philosophy of its development process, and is gaining momentum as an alternative development approach globally. While GNH has been studied from various angles, the survey findings have not been analyzed from a gender perspective. Recognizing this as a critical gap, this study seeks to better understand gender differences in Bhutan. It does so through the disaggregation and analysis of the first GNH nationwide survey data, domains and indicators by gender, triangulation of the findings against secondary literature, and contextualization within contemporary debates about gender in the context of development. Such an exercise is critical, given the disconnects that exist between perceptions of gender 'neutrality' and 'equality' based on women's relatively strong position in certain areas, and the GNH data, which demonstrates gender differences in wellbeing in Bhutan. Our study finds that overall men are happier than women. Men fair better in GNH domains such as education, psychological wellbeing, time use, governance, community vitality, whereas women do better in the domains of living standards and ecological diversity and resilience. Several gender barriers exists, including social stigmas and attitudes that disadvantage women in terms of political participation, decision-making and status. Such an analysis is timely, given the Royal Government of Bhutan's efforts to pro-actively address gender issues that crosscut the GNH domains and shape gender relations, culture and society. The study reflects on Bhutan as a unique context for the study of gender and development, and highlights novel contributions that advance the field of development by studying GNH from a gender lens, and vice versa.

J	Silva, C; Kastenholz, E; Abrantes, JL				Silva, Carla; Kastenholz, Elisabeth; Abrantes, Jose Luis			LINKING MOUNTAIN IMAGE WITH PLACE-ATTACHMENT	JOURNAL OF SPATIAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL DYNAMICS			English	Article						Mountain Tourism; Destination Image; Place-attachment; Social Representations; Literature Review; Sustainable Development	DESTINATION IMAGE; TOURISM; SATISFACTION; EXPERIENCE; INVOLVEMENT; ATTITUDES; BEHAVIOR; IMPACT; TURKEY; TRAVEL	Mountain tourism represents 15-20% of the tourist industry, corresponding to receipts of around 70-90 billion US$ per year. Mountains are attractive tourism destinations because people view them as natural and sacred places with plenty of social, cultural and symbolic meanings. The present study is a conceptual work that debates the link between mountain destination image with place-attachment by summarizing, systematizing and discussing the distinct, yet connected, image and place-attachment constructs. Based on an extensive literature review focusing on the concepts of place-attachment, destination image and social and cultural meanings of mountains, the study provides a framework which allows the assessment of the emotional and functional bonds that tourists can establish with mountain places. Systematization of the literature review should permit a deeper understanding of the diverse meanings and values associated with mountains, increasing our awareness of their social and cultural value. The model sheds light on the diverse dimensions of mountain destination image and their potential link to tourists' place-attachment, which is most interesting for sustainable mountain tourism development. Although the model's validation would further improve our understanding of the relationships between the constructs, the relations already identified in the literature review justify a consideration of the presented dimensions. This more detailed comprehension may enhance tourist mountain destination planning, as well as marketing and management, thus helping mountain DMOs promote distinct and unique mountain features that attract tourists and involve them emotionally with the mountain areas visited and dreamt of.

J	van den Hove, S				van den Hove, S			Between consensus and compromise: acknowledging the negotiation dimension in participatory approaches	LAND USE POLICY			English	Article						participatory approaches; environmental governance; negotiation; consensus; sustainable development	MULTICRITERIA EVALUATION; SCIENCE	In this paper, we argue that participatory approaches should acknowledged e both the irreducible plurality of standpoints and the necessity of common existence in order to be a valuable answer to decision making challenges created by the ecological and societal complexity of environmental issues. We propose that participatory approaches be thought on a continuum between consensus-oriented processes ill the pursuit of a common interest and compromise-oriented negotiation processes aiming at the adjustment of particular interests. This allows to pinpoint the pitfalls of idealistic conceptions of participators approaches where,here the negotiation dimension tends to be denied and occulted. In particular, we argue that ignoring the negotiation dimension of participatory approaches can impede their legitimacy and effectiveness as learning processes to resolve complex environmental issues beyond the interest of the more powerful actor. As an illustration, we look at the relation between multicriteria decision aid and participators processes. We stress the need to explicitly identify areas of consensus and areas of compromise when applying MCDA. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ozkaynak, B				Ozkaynak, Beguem			Globalisation and local resistance: Alternative city developmental scenarios on capital's global frontier the case of Yalova, Turkey	PROGRESS IN PLANNING			English	Review						Urban studies; Driving forces; Scenarios; Governance; Turkey	SOCIAL MULTICRITERIA EVALUATION; PERSPECTIVE; APPRAISAL; FUTURE; ISSUES	Today, defining objectives and setting priorities at local level becomes more and more difficult as the nature and direction of urbanisation is increasingly influenced by global economic integration and the struggle of countries, and indeed, individual cities, to be competitive in the global marketplace (Cohen, 2004). In general, local strategies have to be formed and reformed, based on the logic of macro-level factors as to what is, or is not, feasible, and actors' responses and political judgments about which values and interests they most wish to promote. Given this point of departure, and our need in the 21st century to focus on multi-faceted urban problems, the aim of this paper is to suggest ways in which scenario building and analysis can contribute to small to medium-sized city planning and governance in a globalising world. Based on a project conducted in the province of Yalova, Turkey, the paper presents four possible futures of the city of Yalova in 2020, as a decision support framework to assess and discuss Yalova's alternative development trajectories from economic, social and environmental perspectives and in relation to their consequences for multiple constituencies, given their preferences, value-orientations and expectations. Yalova's futures are conceived under four trajectories, based a set of structural assumptions associated with two key external uncertainties: globalisation, Europe and the future of social and environmental policies on the one hand, and Turkey's relations with the EU, on the other. The first trajectory represents 'Yalova within free markets', in which Turkey is part of a Europe wherein US-style deregulation and privatisation prevail, with reduced social protection systems and environmental regulations. In the second trajectory, 'Yalova within social Europe', Turkey is part of a Europe wherein social and environmental concerns remain important. 'Business as usual in Yalova' is a trajectory wherein the EU cannot agree on a common stance regarding Turkey's membership. In the fourth trajectory, 'Inward-looking Yalova', the EU rejects Turkey but offers special membership. The empirical study conducted in the province of Yalova is then used to explore the constituency interests, coalition formations and power relations and hence understand the potential role of local agency in shaping these four trajectories. Overall, this is an exercise of the exploration of possible outcome scenarios; a subjective yet systematic mind walk which fosters inquiry, creates awareness and spreads political responsibility, engagement and action at local level. Yalova scenarios 2020, with their socioeconomic and environmental implications and their consequences for different constituencies, provide a rich background against which to explore and formulate the paths that need to be taken within a multi-layered system of governance. Such an analysis give us the opportunity to see which alliances might be built to strengthen the forces that favour a more sustainable development path and the roles that different social actors may play in this process. The general research findings also shed light on the challenges facing Turkey for local governance. Of course, many of the challenges and uncertainties Turkey and Yalova face today are not unique. It is hoped that the Yalova scenarios and their subsequent analysis will be relevant to other regional and local authorities finding themselves increasingly under the influence of the external forces resident in the global economy, and considering new planning practices enabling multi-level and multi-actor governance arrangements.

J	Wang, SX				Wang Shaoxing			Party Politics in Socialist Countries: One Hundred Years of Exploration	SOCIAL SCIENCES IN CHINA			English	Article						Marxism; party politics in socialist countries; world socialist movement; socialism with Chinese characteristics; national governance		Over the long history of political civilization, the 100 years of the party politics of socialist countries has emerged as a new form of politics. Exploration of the last 100 years of the party politics of socialist countries deals with the self-governance and national governance of Marxist ruling parties. It reflects intraparty relationships, interparty relationships, relationships between party and government and relationships between party and society, as well as foreign relations, and spans three historical periods, comprising the first establishment of party politics in Soviet Russia; the adoption of party rule in other countries, with concomitant setbacks; and the achievement by China, Vietnam and other countries of party political innovation and development. A review of the experience of the past hundred years shows that success in making party politics the basic system in socialist countries and in tapping its full potential is attributable to the efforts made by Marxist ruling parties to undertake fruitful theoretical reflection and grasp values, adhere to the truth and correct mistakes on the basis of exceptional strategic confidence and policy commitment, while constantly opening up new stages of theoretical understanding and practical development. The party politics of socialist countries in the 21st century drives their modernization and cultivates and improves their practice. The union of the two in the magnificent historical process of the sustainable development of socialist institutional civilization will have major and far-reaching significance for building a brighter future for humanity.

J	Walsh, C				Walsh, Casey			Beyond rules and norms: Heterogeneity, ubiquity, and visibility of groundwaters	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER			English	Article						development; governance; groundwater; political ecology; water cultures	POLITICAL ECOLOGY; MINERAL WATERS; MORAL ECONOMY; SPECIAL-ISSUE; MEXICO-CITY; GOVERNANCE; MANAGEMENT; CHALLENGES; RESOURCES; EVOLUTION	Over the last 150 years or so engineers, farmers, scientists, and many others around the globe have gained access to the waters that lie underground with drilling technology, pumps and cheap energy. Since the mid-twentieth century, a massive worldwide proliferation of deep wells has redistributed groundwaters away from springs, seeps, wells, and oases, robbing them of the water that supports local sustainable socionatural relations. The idea and social fact of groundwater has emerged in this history, and has three distinguishing features: heterogeneity, ubiquity, and visibility. The failure to halt depletion has prompted a turn to culture in the hope of governing the liquid sustainably. However, rather than grapple with the complexities and contradictions of heterogeneity, ubiquity, and visibility, these efforts take a rather thin view of culture-as rules, norms, and institutions to be studied, codified and deployed to address the crisis. This instrumental understanding of culture as a set of traits to be selectively used for arresting depletion has not proven effective, however, compelling us to rethink our cultural, political, and economic engagements with groundwater.

J	Ng, AW				Ng, Artie W.			From sustainability accounting to a green financing system: Institutional legitimacy and market heterogeneity in a global financial centre	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Green bond; Green financing system; Global finance centre of China; Sustainability accounting; Sustainability control and assurance	MANAGEMENT CONTROL-SYSTEMS; CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY; INTEGRATION; ASSURANCE	This study aims to explore the phenomenon of the adoption of sustainability accounting, sustainable financing and relevant regulatory measures for the development of a green financing system in an emerging global financial centre under the influence of sustainable global development. As Hong Kong, the Global Financial Centre of China (GFCC), emerges as a regional green finance hub, a framework of the circumstantial developments that contribute to the development of a green financing system is illustrated. It suggests a top-down approach of institutional legitimacy for sustainability influenced by a national policy and enhanced through a market-based finance approach in the GFCC. Adopting a multiple-case study approach, this paper reveals three cases of sizable listed enterprises notable for their heterogeneous approaches to embracing risk governance, sustainable accounting and financing in their issuance of green bonds. A theoretical framework is proposed over the mutually reinforcing effects of legitimate policy and market-based finance that engender the convergence of a green financing system. The implications for the integrity of a green financing system in relation to sustainability controls and cleaner production are articulated. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Lin, GCS; Kao, SY				Lin, George C.

This understanding has become increasingly dominated by narratives of the urban sustainability fix, which stresses the logic of capital accumulation. Within the broader structural processes of ecological modernization, such as transitioning to low-carbon growth, consideration of-let alone interest in-the diversity of local politics that shapes the practice and forms of contestation of eco-urbanism has often been relegated to a position of secondary importance. Meanwhile, investigations of the relationship between the growth of climate governance and grassroots environmental activism often ignore space production as an underlying process of political-economic transformation. Drawing on a detailed case study of the prevalence of zero-waste neighborhood experiments in many Chinese cities, which have recently become obsessed with low-carbon growth, this article underscores the potential of grassroots activism to change the nature, dynamics and landscape of eco-urbanism significantly. On the basis of the intriguing evidence presented here, it calls for a new understanding of eco-urbanism: one which is more attentive to the diversity, heterogeneity and contextual sensitivity of urban change at the grassroots level.

To this end, it compares China's development-oriented strategy in Europe with the security-driven Atlanticist model and examines how the new governance framework relates to present-day international relations. It holds that the Eurasia-centered OBOR signifies a paradigm that is fundamentally different from the Atlanticist strategy that has come to define the European geopolitical landscape since the end of World War II. The OBOR aims to de-emphasize security arrangements and ensure sustainable development and prosperity by introducing an omnidirectional connectivity and cooperation agenda in the Eurasian strategic context. It is recognized, however, that although the new Eurasian discourse of inclusive development does not aim to directly challenge the United States' highly-institutionalized security presence in Europe, mindful of its larger paradigmatic implications, the United States is likely to view the OBOR unfavorably and seek to reinforce material and ideational fundamentals of the Atlantic alliance.

This contribution is developed on the basis of the viable systems approach (vSa), which is intended as a theoretical framework for the analysis of social phenomena as well as for orienting government processes. Using this theoretical framework, the proposed approach leads to the representation of the territory as a viable system that is capable of surviving in its own context by creating value for the other entities of the context (public groups of governments, communities, investors, natural environment, future generations, non-human species), thus defining the essential conditions for a sustainable equilibrium. The consideration that social phenomena have to be analyzed by taking into account the different relations and interactions that orient the behavior of individuals and, as a consequence, their main collective manifestations, i.e., organizations, underlines the importance of shifting from a traditional reductionist approach to a systemic approach. In what follows, taking a cue from the definition of sustainability that implies a wider sharing, we provide some initial critical positions, and finally shape the useful elements that can be preparatory to the introduction of a working hypothesis that is capable of delineating a possible itinerary for the development of the territory.

Correspondingly, a by-product of network governance has been the emergence of soft employment regulation in which voluntary codes of conduct supplement hard (enforceable) legal employment standards. This paper explores these developments in the context of temporary migrant workers employed in Australian horticulture. First the paper analyses the growing use of temporary migrant labour in this industry. It then describes how different types of intermediaries interact with this workforce. The paper then outlines both hard and soft employment regulations, and contrasts them with actual employment conditions, questioning how a network governance approach has affected this vulnerable workforce. The paper concludes that changes in network governance of migration and employment relations have emasculated formal legal regulation, leaving market forces to operate without effective or ethical constraints at the expense of the public good.

J	Etiegni, CA; Irvine, K; Kooy, M				Etiegni, Christine Adhiambo; Irvine, Kenneth; Kooy, Michelle			Participatory governance in Lake Victoria (Kenya) fisheries: whose voices are heard?	MARITIME STUDIES			English	Article						BMUs; Co-management; Critical institutionalism; Fisheries; Lake Victoria; Participation	TAM GIANG LAGOON; NILE PERCH; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; COMANAGEMENT; MANAGEMENT; COMMUNITY; RESOURCE; POWER; INSTITUTIONS; LESSONS	Co-management is advocated as a means to improve human equity and the ecological sustainability of common-pool resources. The promotion of co-management of fisheries often assumes the participation of resource users in decision-making ensures more ecologically sustainable outcomes than top-down management approaches while improving livelihoods and food security. However, in fisheries co-management approaches, participation is often poorly defined and measured by co-management proponents. For resource users, it may not be clear what their participation in co-management entails, and what such participation might involve or achieve. For the fisheries of Lake Victoria (Kenya), the introduction of co-management established Beach Management Units (BMUs) on a model of participatory decision-making. Unsurprisingly, given global experiences of institutions for resource users' participation in co-management, the structures established across Lake Victoria (Kenya) have not resulted in effective participation of fisher folk. We examine why this is so. Specifically, we examine the influence of institutions on fisher folks' participation in co-management, using critical institutionalism to explain how participation of resource users is shaped by the relation between formal government institutions and informal social norms. We take four BMUs as case studies to investigate how historical administrative structures shape the development of co-management, how power relationships within co-management are negotiated at the local beach level and the fisher folks' understanding of their participation in co-management. We document how informal institutions undermine and replace formal institutions at the local beach level, while formal institutions suppress and ignore informal ones at the national and regional levels. From this, we argue power sharing between the government and fisher folk is key for fisher folk participation in fisheries co-management, capable of addressing both social and ecological challenges facing fisheries management.

SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						neomedievalism; cities; territorial states; circular economy; neoliberalism; competitiveness; modernity; metropolitan regions; sustainability; Middle Ages	GOVERNANCE; REGIONS; CITIES	The role of cities in the transformation of society is discussed. The growing importance of cities and their global networks undermine the nation state. This is a reversal of the development of the modern state which, over several centuries, increased its control over its territory and cities. Such changes have generated renewed interest in the Middle Ages. The relations between Medieval cities and territorial states were part of complex and shifting political arrangements, involving urban networks and overlapping claims to authority over territories. The general characteristics of prospective neomedieval political systems are discussed in more detail and applied to the regulatory challenges faced by neoliberalism and the transformation to a circular economy. The shift in the focus of neoliberal policy from the competitiveness of cities to that of metropolitan regions, with diverging urban and provincial interests hampers neomedievalist coordination. The cooperation between urban and provincial interests can however be realised in the transformation from a linear to a more circular economy, where metropolitan regions are well suited to accommodate the diverging aspects and forms of territorial regulation in a neomedievalist manner.

It explores the dynamics involved in promoting `epistemic justice' in the governance of public policy for sustainability. This is illustrated using a case study exploring the role of local ecological knowledge of artisanal fishers for marine spatial planning in the Seychelles. Qualitative data was first collected through interviews with key informants and in participatory stakeholder workshops exploring the key threats, trade-offs, and challenges for promoting sustainable futures in the marine environment. Secondly, focus groups with local fishers explored the impacts of marine policy upon access to natural resources and local livelihoods, and detailed the role of local ecological knowledge for supporting marine conservation practice. An analysis of grey literature provided additional, contextual data. The case study demonstrates that local ecological knowledge has an important role in informing fine grained, spatial, and temporal management approaches for marine spatial planning. However, in the absence of trust between state planners and fishing communities', knowledge sharing can be challenging. These factors are exacerbated by restrictions that marine policies place on local livelihoods, and the dominance of western paradigms for conservation that marginalises alternative knowledge contributions. The research points to the importance of promoting epistemic justice practices that bring respectful synthesis in knowledge sharing through addressing issues of credibility, trust, transparency, power inequalities, and accountability of state institutions.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on two inductive case studies of French MNCs in the retail sector. Data from interviews and documents were collected and analysed at the headquarters in France and the Brazilian subsidiary. Findings - The paper contributes in the following ways: five challenges are proposed that must be faced by MNCs in managing their CSR strategy. The challenges are related to the link between literature and three dimensions and five sub-dimensions that emerged from the two cases studied: the governance structure (the structure of the CSR department and dialogue with stakeholders); corporate ethics (the definition of objectives and corporate posture); and organizational learning (awareness and information exchanged about CSR). Research limitations/implications - As this is a topic that is little addressed by the. CSR's literature, a future research agenda for the relation between the headquarters and the subsidiary in considering CSR strategies can be established. It is suggested that the five challenges presented here should be deeply explored and potential solutions for each one can be investigated in depth. Practical implications - The proposed challenges can yield some implications for managers of MNCs who are intending to manage the headquarters/subsidiary relationship considering the MNCs' CSR strategies. They should identify adapted ways to introduce actions related to the three dimensions and five sub-dimensions presented here. Originality/value - Little attention has been paid to this specific link between CSR and MNC literature: the relation between the headquarters and the subsidiary considering CSR strategies. This paper proposes some challenges that can help researchers investigate potential solutions and managers to have an agenda to be addressed.

The research is based on a survey of 364 randomly selected environmental and social NGOs in Mexico. A probit model is used to analyze the data and generate insights whereby an NGO's proclivity to engage with the private sector is associated with a number of fundamental organizational characteristics that make them distinct from other NGOs active in their field. The main findings show that likelihood of NGO engagement with firms is correlated with making corporate donations deductible for businesses, NGO size and scope, activities and level of professionalization, sustaining broader stakeholder relations, and showing transparency about the mission and goals of the NGO. The paper includes an analysis of the determinants of specific forms of engagement and discusses some implications for NGO-business engagement and its support of the SDG targets.

In this context, Internet universality indicators (IUI) emerge as a quantification and management technologies for helping states and governments in the assessment of their Internet environments, the reduction of digital gaps and the improvement of internet access. Moreover, these indicators relate to the core of UNESCO's mandate to "promote the free movement of ideas through word and image" and to build inclusive knowledge societies. This tool is aimed at strengthening the Internet's role in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The IUI framework serves to operationalize the concept of "Internet universality", adopted by UNESCO in 2015, through a practical evaluation of the Internet based on the ROAM-X principles, which promote a human rights-based Internet, which have to be open and accessible to all, and include the participation of multiple stakeholders. The results of implementation of these indicators around of world will serve to highlight possible gaps and serve as a basis for developing recommendations to achieve targeted improvements. One of the first implementations of this framework was done in Ecuador during 2019. This study uses the SWOT method in order to analyse this implementation and the results achieved. Findings show that a clear definition of latent concepts as included in each category of IUI in order to identify the best factors-variable for estimating the corresponding aspect in a specific implementation is needed, however, this is a topic that reveals an important research interest from academia in special for quantification and management technologies field.

Experiences of host communities with carbon market projects: towards multi-level climate justice	CLIMATE POLICY			English	Article						carbon markets; Clean Development Mechanism (CDM); host communities; justice; REDD; voluntary carbon markets	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE; CHANGE NEGOTIATIONS; ELITE CAPTURE; FOREST CARBON; CDM; LESSONS; EQUITY; SEQUESTRATION	The literature on equity and justice in climate change mitigation has largely focused on North-South relations and equity between states. However, some initiatives (e.g. the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation programme (REDD), and voluntary carbon markets (VCMs)) are already establishing multi-level governance structures that involve communities from developing countries in global mitigation efforts. This poses new equity and justice dilemmas: how the burdens and benefits of mitigation are shared across various levels and how host communities are positioned in multi-level governance structures. A review of the existing literature is used to distill a framework for distinguishing between four axes of climate justice from the perspective of communities. Empirical evidence from African and Asian carbon market projects is used to assess the distributive and procedural justice implications for host communities. The evidence suggests that host communities often benefit little from carbon market projects and find it difficult to protect their interests. Capacity building, attention to local power relations, supervision of business practices, promotion of projects with primarily development aims and an active involvement of non-state actors as bridges between local communities and the national/international levels could potentially contribute towards addressing some of the key justice concerns.Policy relevance International negotiations on the institutional frameworks that are envisaged to govern carbon markets are proceeding at a rather slow pace. As a consequence, host countries and private-sector actors are making their own arrangements to safeguard the interests of local communities. While several standards have emerged to guide carbon market activity on the ground, distributive as well as procedural justice concerns nevertheless remain salient. Four empirical case studies across Asia and Africa show that within the multi-scale and multi-actor carbon market governance, local-level actors often lack sufficient agency to advance their claims and protect their interests. This evidence suggests that ameliorating policy reforms are needed to enhance the positioning of local communities. Doing so is important to ensure future acceptability of carbon market activity in potential host communities as well as for ensuring their broader legitimacy.

They have two often conflicting purposes: to protect important natural and cultural resources and to offer the possibility to use these areas as well as to enjoy them. People love to travel to protected natural areas just because on a relatively small but representative territory they can see a large number of plant and animal species, as well as participate in recreational activities in a pristine environment. The purpose of this study was to identify the motives and constraints for visiting national parks in relation to age, education level and employment status. The research was conducted among the London residents who are potential visitors of national parks in England. A total of 107 respondents were questioned through an online survey. The results obtained in this study showed that there are differences in motives and constraints in relation to sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents. The results of this study could direct the management of national parks to focus more on identifying and meeting the needs of potential visitors because of the increasing popularity of ecotourism.

J	Ponce, HG; Gil, MTN; Duran, MP				Gutierrez Ponce, Herenia; Nevado Gil, Ma Teresa; Pache Duran, Maria			Responsible public procurement. Design of measurement indicators	CIRIEC-ESPANA REVISTA DE ECONOMIA PUBLICA SOCIAL Y COOPERATIVA			Spanish	Article						Sustainable Public Procurement; Indicators; Social Responsibility; Social and environmental clauses	SUSTAINABLE PROCUREMENT; SECTOR	The European Union recognizes the importance of public procurement as one of the instruments that must be used to achieve smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. In Spain, Law 9/2017, of November 8, on Public Sector Contracts, transposes the European Parliament and Council Directives 2014/23/EU and 2014/24/EU into the Spanish legal system. This law aims to incorporate transversally socially responsible criteria when preparing and executing public contracts. In addition, it obliges bidding companies to meet specific requirements on gender equality, fair labor conditions, fair trade consumption or energy efficiency. Specifically, the basic objectives pursued by the Law are; the impartiality and objectivity of procedures, greater transparency in public procurement and improving the quality- price ratio. All this means guaranteeing the correctness of the procedures, avoiding any hint of corruption and using public procurement in a strategic manner to implement, with the resources that are managed through the contracts, public policies at communitarian and national levels in the social, environmental, and development fields and the innovation and promotion of the participation of small and medium enterprises in public procurement. Faced with this situation, public administrations have begun to develop guidelines and approve instructions for the implementation of socially responsible clauses in their hiring. However, despite its importance, there is no specific measurement instrument that evaluates this type of behavior. In this context, we propose this research with the aim of facilitating a tool, composed of a series of ethical and sustainable indicators, in line with the new Law, which allow comparative measurement and comparison of the responsible behavior of administrations in relation to their public contracts. In this way, the contracting bodies must present in their specifications concrete measures to guarantee, on the one hand, integrity in their contracting procedures and, on the other hand, the strategic use of their contracts. All this it will allow to implement, with the resources that are managed through contracts, national and international policies in social, environmental, promotion of innovation and of the participation of small and medium enterprises in public procurement. The research has revealed the existence of numerous guides and publications for the implementation of social, ethical and environmental clauses in public procurement, as well as instructions or agreements on sustainable public procurement. Specifically, in Spain, there are many administrations that, in recent years, have published good practice guides for the inclusion of Social Responsibility clauses in their contracts. In addition, it has been observed the continued existing commitment of the Spanish public administrations with the Social Responsibility, through the approval of Agreements or Instructions. Indeed, since 2005, in which the Good Governance Code of the General State Administration was approved in Spain, and in 2009, when the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces approved its own Code of Good Governance, very significant steps have been taken in terms of Social Responsibility and sustainability. In the second stage of the study, a series of social and environmental indicators were created to evaluate and compare responsible practices in public procurement throughout the different phases of the contract (preparation, awarding, execution). This first investigation has some limitations derived from the lack of quantitative data, however, like any exploratory study, it constitutes a hypothesis-generating element and serves as the basis for future investigations that allow evaluating the hiring of the entities that make up the public sector in relationship to social, environmental and ethical issues. At the same time, this proposal may favor focusing the practices and responsible policies to address the observed shortcomings, contributing to obtain economic and social environmental benefits, for the Administration and for the private sector and society in general. According to the objectives formulated in this exploratory study, it has been proven that, increasingly and with a general nature, public administrations are aware and are concerned about the aspects that have to do with Transparency, Social Responsibility and sustainability. From the analysis of the current situation of sustainable public procurement, the important efforts of the initiatives, both national and international, aimed at strengthening a regulatory framework in this area are confirmed. Specifically, in Spain, it is observed that there are many administrations that adopt the commitment to be socially responsible in their hiring. However, the great task that remains to be done to adapt to the regulatory framework in these matters has been verified. The importance of this work, because it is a pioneer, is that it has defined a series of indicators that serve to evaluate sustainability in public procurement. In addition, the proposed indicators allow to guide the implementation of good practices and can be used in future research as a basic methodological instrument to advance in the understanding and improvement of sustainable public procurement processes. All this will allow knowing the current situation of sustainable public procurement and being able to compare them over time, evaluate the impact of the approval of procurement laws in local administrations, determine good practices in public procurement, measure the effects of instructions or agreements on public procurement, identify if there are patterns of behavior among public administrations in relation to their responsible contracting and what could be the conditioning factors of sustainable practices in public procurement.

In the Institutional Analysis and Development Framework, action situations can be studied singularly, in comparison, or as networks of action situations. Building on this work, we propose to complement an established action situation with new ones derived from the evolution of the case. This preserves the initial action situation and thereby enables scholars to keep track of institutional change within and beyond it. We illustrate the approach by studying a case of groundwater pollution by nitrate in a German region of intensive livestock farming.

Based on the assumption that clusters generate innovation, policy-makers at all levels of governance have adopted instruments and mechanisms to stimulate, resource and sustain clusters. Despite the considerable attention paid to the clustering phenomenon, empirical evidence on to what extent firms' innovation activities benefit from operating in clusters is scarce and inconclusive. This paper contributes to the micro-foundation of clustering effects by examining the characteristics and activities of cluster firms in relation to their innovativeness. Bridging innovation, management and cluster theories, it is argued that structural and relational embeddedness, relational capital and absorptive capacity influence clustered firms' innovativeness. Partial least-squares structural equation modelling of data from 104 firms in two software and information technology service sector clusters reveals that firms' structural embeddedness (i.e. frequency of interactions) in clusters and external networks facilitates innovation cooperation. Firms' absorptive capacity reinforces this positive effect of cluster-internal interactions on innovation cooperation. Results also suggest a substitution effect of trust as relational control mechanisms for formal control mechanisms within the cluster. However, the study finds no significant impact of firms' innovation cooperation within the cluster (i.e. relational embeddedness) on their innovation success.

A review of inclusive business models and their application in aquaculture development	REVIEWS IN AQUACULTURE			English	Review						business; inclusive; pro-poor; smallholder; value chains	GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS; FOOD VALUE CHAINS; CERTIFICATION STANDARDS; VERTICAL COORDINATION; RURAL-DEVELOPMENT; QUIET REVOLUTION; FISH CONSUMPTION; GOVERNANCE; POVERTY; SHRIMP	For aquaculture to continue along its current growth trajectory and contribute towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, value chains must become more inclusive. Smallholders and other local value chain actors are often constrained by circumstances and market failures in the global aquaculture industry. Integrating these actors into aquaculture value chains through inclusive business models (IBMs) is often touted as a solution to sustainable and ethical trade and business that can generate development outcomes. We reviewed 36 papers under seven business models commonly used in agriculture development to assess their application in aquaculture value chains in lower-income countries. A global value chain (GVC) analysis is used to unpack the economic and social upgrading objectives of the different IBMs, as well as the types of relational coordination used between actors in the chain to achieve development outcomes. The extent to which these IBMs helped poor actors overcome certain barriers is evaluated with a focus on how they may ensure or be a risk to inclusiveness through the relations and upgrading opportunities evident in their make-up. The analysis found that the majority of the models focused on economic upgrading over social upgrading. Providing opportunities for the latter is key to achieving the inclusive objectives of IBMs. Greater horizontal coordination between actors can create further opportunities for economic upgrading established under vertical coordination with other nodes upstream and downstream in a value chain. There is a need to further contextualize these models to aquaculture systems and develop clear indicators of inclusiveness.

We examine the role and authority of a new type of actor that has recently emerged on the global stage-the social entrepreneur, who tackles social and ecological problems with entrepreneurial means. We consider them as agents that perform functions and provide services that have been considered to be the sole authority of states. For instance, the provision of water services has long been considered an exclusive task of the state. The water sector therefore serves as a good example to explore how these agents come up with their own missions and political agendas. Via an illustrative sample of social entrepreneurs from around the world, we explore their relation to water governance in general and the hydraulic mission in particular. We propose that their innovative potential serves as their main source of authority. Their local embeddedness along with their educational efforts, participatory goals, and accreditation as "social entrepreneur" provide additional sources of authority.

The dynamic approach adopted in this study permits to evaluate the simultaneous influence of specific factors on total entrepreneurial activity. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative approach through a panel vector autoregression analysis was adopted to take into account possible endogeneity issues, and a short-run Granger test was used to test causality between variables to fill the theoretical and empirical gap about the joined and dynamic effect of institutional quality, economic factors and unemployment on total entrepreneurship activity as a dependent variable. Findings The use of a dynamic estimation approach demonstrates that three kinds of relative effects exist: durable and positive effects between industrial production index (IPI), stability and self-employment, a limited positive effect which exists during a predeterminant period between dimensions of institutional quality and unemployment rate (UR) and finally negative effects between IPI and UR. Research limitations/implications In general, this study identifies three main effects: negative, temporary positive and perpetual positive. This is the same conclusion for the link between self-employment rates (SER) and institutional quality, measured by six dimensions. Three of these dimensions are especially important: political stability and the absence of violence, governmental effectiveness and regulatory quality. Practical implications In light of this study's results and contrary to the idea admitted about the negative effect of unemployment on entrepreneurial activity, it seems that a relatively positive effect exists. By relative, the author means during a determinant period. It also has to be remembered that entrepreneurial activity was appreciated by the SER according to the recommendation of many previous researchers discussed at the beginning of this paper. Based on the model, three levels of relations emerge. This permits this study to dress a hierarchical list of alternatives to promote entrepreneurial activity. Economic policymakers have to reconsider the importance of the UR as the best occasion to create firms if good institutions and economic support are provided. Good governance and stability are the most important institutional determinants with a long positive effect. This conclusion suits Glaeser and Saks (2006) as well as Ojeka et al. (2019). Social implications This research offers considerable scientific evidence to make decisions and orient decisions-makers about policies adopted to increase institutional quality, reducing unemployment and stimulate economic activity, but it is still necessary to reconsider these results for developing countries. It is hoped that future researchers enrich and reinforce the model to provide a critical pathway for successful entrepreneurship activity in this new normal. In the end, this crisis can be also treated as a good occasion to innovate and reconsider the thinking process to manage and operate in the economic world. Originality/value This study's contribution is to help and assist economic policymakers to be aware of the relative importance of such determinants at the country level. The introduction of the relative importance of time is in agreement with the concept of entrepreneurial opportunity.

This requires transition from traditional software engineering methods for an extended competitiveness which is successfully demonstrated in private sector; however, its potential benefits in the public sector are still unknown. In this paper, we assess employability of agile methods to improve software quality in large public sector software development companies. The choice of public sector is made due to its key role in sustainable e-Governance models to ensure uninterrupted services to the citizens. A survey of 28 questions, on software quality components (budget, time, faster debugging and correctness, changeability, easy testability and installability), is collected from the IT professionals of nine software development companies at WAPDA (water and power development authority), the largest public sector organization in Pakistan. The results conclude that these factors have more strong and positive relation to the software quality in agile development than traditional methods in public sector when the software product is to be developed, delivered, deployed and sustainably maintained in short span of time due to its inherent capability of easy debugging, testability and installability.

While achieving these targets can potentially bring about numerous benefits, there are also various risks, largely determined by governance, including decision making processes, in these landscapes. We used a case study in northern Thailand to understand what determines landscape collaboration, and adherence to principles of FLR. We developed an assessment framework and worked with landscape stakeholders to understand their interests and capacities to effectively engage in FLR processes. Although there is strong willingness to collaborate among stakeholders, there is limited space for local communities to participate. This issue is especially problematic considering the state?s hesitation to recognize customary rights to natural resources, which has produced a deep imbalance in power relations among stakeholders. This contributes to the disenabling environment for effective collaboration, a pre-condition for the success of FLR. We argue that the source of imbalances need to be addressed to promote the participation of local communities, particularly marginalized groups, to minimize risks of sub-optimal and unsustainable outcomes from the collaboration. This requires the devolution of decision making power through supportive legal frameworks and creation of platforms cutting across scales (i.e. landscape to national), and sectors (e.g. forestry, agriculture, infrastructure and finance), as well as being multi-stakeholder. This also highlights the urgent need to percolate the lofty commitments on FLR to the national and landscape scales, accompanied by resources and capacity development support.

We note that a society which designs its own development focusing on maximizing profits regardless of the environmental consequences, may end up finding that, in fact, it achieved the "maximum pollution", severely degrading the environment, the natural resources and therefore mankind itself. Pollution means nothing but to destroy the environment, the support and source of life, which we "long ago" received from God. The new aspects of the development/economic growth, with all their deriving effects directly affecting the environment and life/existence of mankind, have determined us to try, based on the specialty literature, a philosophical and ethical approach of the relation between the economy and the environment. At the same time, we dedicate a certain amount of space to the position of institutional and neo-institutional economists in this respect, as well as to the role of their own interest and altruism in shaping behaviours.

Retailers have been particularly active in setting food safety and quality systems for the development of their private labels. The purpose of this paper is to identify the effects of introducing measures that guarantee the environmental sustainability of food production on vertical dyadic relations. We focus our attention on the adoption of integrated pest management (IPM) systems that are designed by retailers to support private label products, with the aim of studying how these systems affect the governance structure of transactions between retailer and farmer/processor. Transaction cost analysis is used as theoretical framework to assess changes in vertical coordination after the adoption of an IPM system. Four case studies related to food retailers in Italy were analyzed to identify changes in transaction characteristics, costs, and governance that are related to the adoption of this system. The results show that the introduction of an IPM system leads to an increase of transaction asset specificity (i.e., especially of human and material asset specificity) among the agents of the supply chain, and a decrease of the degree of transaction uncertainty. The variations in transaction characteristics determine changes in transaction costs. These changes lead to new hybrid forms of transaction governance, namely dyadic contracts, and a centralized organization of vertical relationships.

These projects, often labelled as smart city projects, are typically supported by municipalities, funded by subsidies, and run in partnerships. Many of the projects fade out after the pilot stage, and fail to generate scalable solutions that contribute to sustainable urban development. The lack of scaling is widely perceived as a major problem. In this paper, we analyze processes of upscaling, focusing on smart city pilot projects in which several partnerswith different missions, agendas, and incentivesjoin up. We start with a literature review, in which we identify three types of upscaling: roll-out, expansion, and replication, each with its own dynamics and degree of context sensitivity. The typology is further specified in relation to several conditions and requirements that can impact upscaling processes, and illustrated by a descriptive analysis of three smart city pilot projects developed in Amsterdam. The paper ends with conclusions and recommendations on pilot projects and partnership governance, and adds new perspectives on the debate regarding upscaling.

In order to build a stable and long-term international cooperation mechanism in marine plastic waste, this paper takes the country as the research object and propose an international marine plastic waste cooperation network. We introduce the "Matthew effect" of network connection and relationship cost into the model from the perspective of social relations, and uses the method of the evolutionary game on complex networks to construct the evolutionary game model of marine plastic waste treatment. Through simulation methods, this paper explores the impact of economic factors, relational structure and game structure on the evolution of management cooperation of marine plastic waste. It not only provides a theoretical basis for international cooperation in marine plastic waste management, but also provides a clear direction for its implications in practice. Based on the theoretical analysis and empirical research, this research finds that: First, in management cooperation of marine plastic waste, economic factors are the most direct factor, relational structure plays a regulatory role, and game structure is an intermediary variable. Second, the benefits and costs of governance cooperation in economic factors promote and inhibit the cooperation behavior of group respectively. Relationship structure has a two-way effect on the cooperation behavior of group and network stability. Moreover, the cumulative income weight in the game structure is positively related to the partner density. Finally, the key to the current cooperative governance of marine plastic waste is to build a stable and long-term market mechanism, properly handle the influence of major powers, regulate the governance relationships, and promote international cooperation in marine plastic waste management.

The article examines trade and investment agreements as regulatory vehicles that cultivate poor dietary consumption and inequalities in health outcomes between and within countries. How does this happen? The liberalization of trade and investment, and unfettered influence of powerful economic interests including transnational food and beverage companies has resulted in trade agreements that enable excess availability, affordability and acceptability of highly processed, nutrient poor foods worldwide, ultimately resulting in poor nutrition and consequently oral and other non-communicable diseases. These trade and nutrition policy tensions shine a spotlight on the challenges ahead for global health and development policies, including achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.

In this article, we review knowledge co-production as a popular approach in environmental and sustainability science communities to the generation of useable knowledge for sustainability and resilience. We present knowledge systems analysis as a conceptual and empirical framework for understanding existing co-production processes as preconditions to the design of new knowledge infrastructures in cities. Knowledge systems are the organizational practices and routines that make, validate, communicate, and apply knowledge. The knowledge systems analysis framework examines both the workings of these practices and routines and their interplay with the visions, values, social relations, and power dynamics embedded in the governance of building sustainable cities. The framework can be useful in uncovering hidden relations and highlighting the societal foundations that shape what is (and what is not) known by cities and how cities can co-produce new knowledge with meaningful sustainability and resilience actions and transformations. We highlight key innovations and design philosophies that we think can advance research and practice on knowledge co-production for urban sustainability and resilience.

J	Zikhali-Nyoni, T				Zikhali-Nyoni, Thobekile			The Role of SADC in Transboundary Water Interactions: The Case of the Incomati International River Basin	JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN STUDIES			English	Article						SADC; transboundary water governance; constructivist institutionalism; agency; structure; Incomati river basin	AFRICA	Southern Africa is a water-scarce region with an inherent climatic variability and uneven distribution of perennial rivers, which limits the economic growth potential of the region and makes water a strategic resource. This puts water under the spotlight and begs the question how South Africa, eSwatini (formerly Swaziland) and Mozambique co-operate in the Incomati river basin despite the challenges confronting them? This article explores how equitable utilisation, sustainable development and information sharing envisaged by the SADC revised water protocol are perceived by the Incomati river basin stakeholders in practice. Through constructivist institutionalism, the article foregrounds agency as an important element to understand transboundary water interactions, arguing that structure and agency are mutually constitutive. This enables a shift from methodological individualism to an appreciation that structure and agency each possess independent analytic qualities that evolve with time. In turn, this produces complex transboundary water interactions that are interconnected through a triad of structure, ideas and agency. The article draws its analysis from 43 interviews conducted with different stakeholders in the Incomati river basin, participatory observations, informal conversations, a review of literature and SADC official documents. Despite various measures in place to promote regional development and integration, power still permeates SADC water governance in a way that affects information sharing and equitable and sustainable water management. Taking power as an explanandum, the article finds that, to a large degree, the constructed transboundary water relations in the Incomati river basin do not acquiesce to structural power. Instead of being passive, stakeholders constantly negotiate and renegotiate ways of governing the shared river based on the context and preferences.

The role of participation in the planning process: examples from Sweden	LOCAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Participation; legitimacy; planning; land use; Sweden	GOVERNANCE; LEGITIMACY; SECTORS	Participation in decision-making has successively developed into a guiding principle at both EU and national level. However, diverse perspectives exist on what the role of different interests in participative processes should be, and the legal rules regarding participation varies between different sectors; from clearly defined to virtually non-existent requirements. This may have adverse effects on the legitimacy of decisions and decision-making. This paper reviews the role of participation in the planning process in relation to natural resource development in Sweden, as guided by EU and international law. Based on the notion of effective participation, the study illustrates the potential clashes that may result from different conceptions of participation, for instance, at various levels of governance, as well as from disparate principles for implementation in different sectors.

The article draws upon the evolving tradition of critical economy-environment research from a broadly regulationist perspective. However, to date research has tended to mask the politics and mediations of the development agenda by actors locked in struggle to shape their social, economic and environmental landscapes. It is argued that reducing institutions to their stylized forms ignores the real politics associated with institutional formation and outcome. A more fruitful approach, we suggest, is to draw upon recent work on institutions and institutional change. In particular the article utilizes a decentered institutional analysis put forth by political scientists Mark Bevir and Rod Rhodes and investigates empirical data from secondary sources and interviews in the Boston city-region with reference to Bevir and Rhodes' three concepts of dilemmas, traditions and beliefs.

In cities of Latin America, for example, the need for more nature-based infrastructure is evident due to its degree of urbanization and degradation of ecosystems, as well as the alteration of the local water cycle. In this study, an experimental approach for the implementation of a prototype is presented. The prototype consists of a gray-hybrid element for first flush bio-treatment and runoff detention, adapted to the existing stormwater sewer. The experiment took place in a highly urbanized watershed located in the Metropolitan Area of Costa Rica. The characteristics of the existing infrastructure in the study area at different scales were mapped and compared using the Urban Water System Transition Framework. Subsequently, preferences related to spatial locations and technologies were identified from different local decision-makers. Those insights were adopted to identify a potential area for the implementation of the prototype. The experiment consisted of the adaptation of the local sewer to act as a temporal reservoir to reduce the effects derived from rapid generation of stormwater runoff. Unexpected events, not considered initially in the design, are reported in this study as a means to identify the necessary adaptations of the methodology. Our study shows from an experimental learning-experience that the relation between different actors advocating for such technologies influences the implementation and operation of non-conventional technologies. Furthermore, the willingness of residents to modify their urban environments was found to be associated to their own perceptions about security and vandalism occurring in green spaces. The implementation of the prototype showed that both the hydraulic performance is relevant for considering it as a success, as well as the dynamics of the adapted element with the existing urban conditions. In consequence, those aspects should be carefully considered as the design factors of engineering elements when they are related to complex socio-ecological urban systems.

Previous studies focused on analyzing the conflict between the original population, Maya traditional farmers and beekeepers, and the recently arrived migrants, Mennonite industrial farmers. We used 'A Theory of Access' (Ribot and Peluso 2003) to analyze everyday interactions and relations among the two ethnic groups, and opinions of Maya farmers on Mennonites presence in the area. Our sources of data were scientific publications and interviews with local farmers. We found that Mennonites have a broader "bundle of powers" since they have more capital, farm machinery, technical agricultural knowledge, and organizational and entrepreneurial skills than Maya farmers. Besides the reported conflicts, Maya and Mennonite farmers also enter into many everyday interactions and relations of cooperation and mutual dependence. These results may inform the design of public policies for sustainable rural development, including the national REDD+ strategy, to promote positive environmental and economic changes and help to ameliorate social conflict in the municipality.

A National Census of Sustainability in K-12 Education Policy: Implications for International Monitoring, Evaluation, and Research	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION AND POLICY			English	Article						sustainability education; education for sustainable development; environmental education; climate change education; Sustainable Development Goals; education policy; whole institution approach; eco schools; monitoring; evaluation	CHALLENGES	This paper reports on the first nationwide census examining sustainability uptake in policy initiatives in Canadian K-12 education. Included in the study are each of Canada's 13 provincial and territorial ministries of education, and all 374 public school divisions across the country. Sustainability was defined as including, at minimum, consideration of environmental issues, with the study also encompassing use of other related terminologies. Data were collected on three types of policy initiatives: (a) the existence of sustainability-specific policy, (b) participation in sustainability certification programs. and (c) the existence of sustainability staff, which were examined in relation to a range of geographic and institutional variables. Sustainability-specific policy was examined across five domains of a whole institution approach to sustainability: governance, curriculum, facilities and operations, research, and community outreach. We found that 54% of ministries of education and 59% of school divisions in Canada had sustainability-specific policy, most commonly in the curriculum domain at the ministry level and in the operations domain at the school division level. In addition, 43% of school divisions had participated in a sustainability certification program, and 25% had sustainability staff. We discuss implications for policy making in Canada as well for intergovernmental UN policy programs, in particular regarding new policy development and monitoring and evaluation efforts.

Launched in 2005, Bonsucro is the principal MSI that focuses on sustainability standards for sugar and sugarcane ethanol production. Bonsucro claims that because it is free from government interference and draws on scientific metrics, their standards transcend localized, political-economic contexts. In this paper, we illustrate how the local context shapes the prospects for Bonsucro sustainably certified biofuel production in relation to land and water grabs. To accomplish this, our case focuses on Colombia, which has used a range of national policy mandates to establish itself as one of the larger producers of agrofuels in Latin America. We draw on interviews with stakeholders in the sugar and ethanol industries, paired with an examination of Bonsucro principles on land rights and water use, to illustrate how the sugar industry is framing their participation in Bonsucro, and the effects of the increasing intensification of sugarcane for ethanol production on land and water access for communities. We find that within the context of Colombia, efforts such as Bonsucro provide a veil of legitimacy and authority to a system that is premised on deeply entrenched historical patterns of inequitable land ownership patterns and access to natural resources.

Higher audit fees imply increased audit testing and higher audit quality. We find that the existence of an audit committee, more frequent committee meetings and increased use of internal audit are related to higher audit fees. The expertise of audit committee members is associated with higher audit fees when meeting frequency and independence are low. These findings are consistent with an increased demand for higher quality auditing by audit committees, and by firms that make greater use of internal audit.

The studies are based on the analysis of literature and individual research. They include the following: communication and marketing relating to psychosocial, economic processes, methods of social influence exertion, means of social communication policy in marketing, Public Relations (PR) as an element of marketing, addressing universal areas of activities, aims and tasks of PR. Social communication is an important tool of management. It supports processes of taking decisions by organization management and facilitates meeting of the established objectives. It is also an indispensable element of marketing, in which the most commonly used means of social communication policy are: advertisement, promotion and PR. Marketing management theoreticians consider public relations as a management function of continuous and planned character leading to a sustainable position of the organization in the market and fulfilling its interests. It is possible by means of systematic research and analysis of firm opinion in the internal and external environment at the same time to apply such means of social communication which are adequate in order to gain and sustain a good reputation of the organization in the community. PR activities are performed as a strategic, planned and long-lasting policy of the company. As the researchers showed they are a vital element of the contemporary complex market. Social community (an indispensable instrument of the operational marketing) is a process of information flow among individuals, social groups or organizations. It is an important element not only in the functioning of the society but also in market activities. The authors analyzed the most efficient methods, taking into consideration positive and negative effects of the activities connected to social communication. During advertising or promotional campaigns there is use made of scientific developments as sociology or social psychology. Social communication policy might stimulate demand for products, increase profits of a company or create new workplaces, leading to success. Specialists from this area make use of all means and generate demand having influence on emotions, needs or concerns through known methods of social influence exertion and symbolism of communication.

The green growth premise is that this problem can be solved without surrendering continued economic growth by a redirection of human effort to invent green energy technology, green energy markets, and green energy choice. Proponents have argued that green-energy based economic growth represents a paradigm shift bringing forth sustainable and equitable relations between environment, economy, and society. The paper reviews a decade of green energy growth strategies and practices. The Korean Green Growth Initiative (KGGI) is investigated as a case study of green energy growth operationalization. Korea's experiment was widely hailed by international bodies such as The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) for its bold attempt at paradigm shift, with the hope that, if it succeeded, countries currently on the periphery of modern development would be able to overcome conditions of poverty, environmental degradation, and political dependency. But our analysis of the Korean case questions the idea and ideology of green energy growth, demonstrating instead that KGGI was quickly coopted by the paradigm it was supposed to supplant. In this respect, one contradiction in the strategy and practice of green energy growth has been its promise to change the trajectory of modern development without requiring serious changes in modern values and ideology.

The pandemic's disastrous worldwide health impacts have been exacerbated by, and have compounded, the unsustainability of economic globalisation based on the neoliberal dismantling of state capabilities in favour of markets. Flow-on economic impacts have simultaneously created major supply and demand disruptions, and highlighted the growing within-country inequalities and precarity generated by neoliberal regimes of labour market regulation. Taking an Australian and international perspective, we examine these economic and labour market impacts, paying particular attention to differential impacts on First Nations people, developing countries, women, immigrants and young people. Evaluating policy responses in a political climate of national and international leadership very different from those in which major twentieth century crises were addressed, we argue the need for a national and international conversation to develop a new pathway out of crisis.

Seen in this way analysis of human responses to climate change must engage with social relations of power. We explore the potential for resilience theory to meet this challenge by applying a framework that integrates the adaptive cycle heuristic and structuration theory to place power at the heart of the analysis and question the transformational qualities of social systems facing climate change. This theoretical frame is applied to Mahahual and Playa del Carmen, two rapidly expanding towns on Mexico's Caribbean coast. The resilience lens is successful in highlighting internal contradictions that maintain social relations of rigidity above flexibility in the existing governance regimes and development pathway. This generates a set of reinforcing institutions and actions that support the status quo while simultaneously undermining long-term flexibility, equitable and sustainable development. One outcome is the placing of limits on scope for adaptation and mitigation to climate change which are externalized from everyday life and development planning alike.

However, evidence is lacking on how actors choose to cooperate. Previous research in institutions, organizations, and communities show that formal, contract-based as well as informal, relation-based cooperation occur jointly or in substitution, depending on the context and the subject of research. However, neither the approaches nor their underlying dimensions have been tested for the reality of tourist destination communities. For a European Alpine tourism destination the results show that only relation-based items, in combination with communication variables, strongly positively influence cooperative behavior. The paper suggests a series of implications for tourism destination planning and concludes with indications for further research.

Effective management of the park requires collaborative processes that engage local resource users. Co-management provides an important model for sustainable governance, but creating a co-management system is complicated and time consuming. The authors examine the initial stages of planning and establishing the park and outline four successful social developments within these processes that can aid in the creation of a co-management system.

Particular emphasis is placed on the role of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and the relations between the government and the SOE sector. Design/methodology/approach - The paper follows an inductive approach, and is largely based on interviews with industry actors and representatives for relevant government agencies, complemented with secondary data. Findings - The preliminary findings suggest that unlike Western market economies, where the impact of public policy on innovation is relatively transparent and well recorded (in the form of fiscal and financial incentives and formal legislation), much of Chinese innovation is driven by less formal decisions taken in the nexus between SOEs and relevant state agencies. Hence, although China suffers no lack of legislation at various levels (including laws, decrees, and guidelines) it is often difficult to identify the specific drivers for change. Practical implications - The findings are useful for understanding the development of the NEV industry in China. Originality/value - The current paper is the first application of the GIST (Governance of Innovation towards Sustainability Technology) framework to the case of the Chinese NEV industry.

J	Christensen, LD				Christensen, Lotte Dalgaard			Policy coherence in the Nordic bioeconomy? A novel set-theoretic approach to studying relations among policy goals	ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND GOVERNANCE			English	Article						configurational analysis; green transition; necessary conditions; novel biomass utilization; set-theory; sustainable development	ENERGY EFFICIENCY; TRANSITION; QCA	The green transition requires a reduction in the consumption of fossil fuels, and new innovations suggest that refined biomass can replace fossils within many different industries. In recent years, policy-makers have therefore framed the bioeconomy as a stepping-stone for realizing social, economic and environmental objectives in the green transition. However, the policy coherence literature faces a key challenge for analyzing whether these policy goals are indeed compatible: few methods offer a systematic approach for detecting interdependencies and interactions among three (or more) policy goals. The present paper addresses this methodological challenge by proposing a novel set-theoretic approach, the Alternating Necessity Test, for identifying whether policies are incoherent, weakly coherent, or strongly coherent. The present paper applies this approach to the Nordic bioeconomy context, findings the Nordic bioeconomy strategy to be weakly coherent. This suggests that the Nordic countries can replace fossil fuels with refined biomass without encountering trade-offs among social, economic and environmental policy goals, but also without experiencing any synergies. Demonstrating how policy coherence and goal compatibility can be conceptualized in set-theoretic terms, this paper offers a novel tool for identifying those situations in which policy-makers should focus not only on overcoming incoherence, but on progressing from weak to strong policy coherence.

J	Gjolberg, M				Gjolberg, Maria			Varieties of corporate social responsibility (CSR): CSR meets the "Nordic Model"	REGULATION & GOVERNANCE			English	Review							INTERNATIONALISM	Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is increasingly being promoted as an instrument for global governance to address the regulatory vacuum surrounding transnational business activities and as a method for encouraging business to contribute to sustainable development at the national level. Originally a business-driven, American concept, CSR has now been adopted and promoted by a wide range of governments and multilateral institutions. However, the socio-political model underlying CSR is far from neutral and may conflict with existing models in the societies in which it is introduced. In this article a typology of possible governmental interpretations of CSR is developed, and how CSR is transformed and adapted in its meeting with Nordic governments in order to fit the "Nordic Model" of state-market-society relations is analyzed. The analysis suggests that pre-existing political-economic institutions and cultural norms deeply affect the interpretation of CSR, and that this, when combined with ongoing national political processes, leads to a highly transformed concept of CSR.

J	Bien, C; Klussmann, C				Bien, Colin; Klussmann, Coco			Exploring fields of ambiguity in the sustainability transition of universities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Ambiguity; Sustainable university; Organisational change management for sustainability; Sustainability transition; Conceptualising sustainability; Change in universities	2 KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION; HIGHER-EDUCATION; TRANSDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH; SOCIAL-CONTRACT; TRANSFORMATIVE SCIENCE; ORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE; TRIPLE-HELIX; IVORY TOWER; INNOVATION; SENSEMAKING	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework that systematically captures the ambiguity of different understandings about science, the university and its relation to society, while conceptualising sustainability. Following Corley and Gioia (2004, p. 174) on identity ambiguity and change, it seems pivotal to better understanding the ambiguity of sustainability in relation to academic cultures and university models to manage the transition more effectively. Design/methodology/approach The nature of this paper's objectives as well as the wide thematic scope leads to the need of exploring a broad knowledge base. This was best addressed by an exploratory literature review with data collection from primary and secondary sources. The data was interpreted through a hermeneutic analysis and resulted in the inductive development of first categories and goals (further referred to as category development). In addition, a multi-method approach further adjusted the categories and raised their empirical validity and social robustness. Findings Implementing sustainability involves dealing with a double bound ambiguity due to organisational and individual identity reasons. Five fields of ambiguity were developed to systemise the conceptualisation of a sustainable university along contradictory understandings of science, the university and sustainability. These fields offer a framework to qualitatively assess the degree of sustainability in higher education institutions. Arguments for and against sustainability in universities have been categorised around five criteria and associated to the fields of ambiguity. The finding indicates that meaning in organisational change management for sustainability can be considered both, a potential driver and barrier for a sustainability transition in universities. Research limitations/implications This paper exclusively focussed on the internal perspective and left aside any external factors that influence the sustainability transition, such as political measures to stimulate sustainability in higher education. In addition, the operational dimension of a sustainable university has been neglected, which is by all means a necessary and important aspect. The interrelation of the identified goals has not been discussed. Originality/value This paper focusses on the conceptualisation and understanding of sustainability within the institution, an often-forgotten but fundamental aspect of implementation. The fields of ambiguity are designed to be applied for assessing the "degree of maturity" of a sustainable university. The fields reveal the different understandings about the role, the mission and the governance of universities, stemming from competing preferences about goals and their assumed relations by various stakeholders of a higher education institutions. The five fields are not an attempt to resolve the hidden contradictions and tensions in a sustainability transition, but to state them clearly to anticipate resistances and conflicts that hinder the development of a shared understanding.

The political and technical response to the natural disaster emerged through the realization of a new town providing housing for displaced persons. Monterusciello was designed as a new town alternative to the construction models of the late 70s and early 80s: in here, there are no high-density buildings or a lack of public spaces. This new town had high ambitions in terms of planning the new housing settlement, inspired by a classical forma urbis and a human scale architecture. Despite the intellectual and political effort to find an effective solution to a collective drama, which affected most of Pozzuoli's population, many things did not work. The current public administration is making an ambitious attempt to face and solve the many open issue linked to this serious context of urban poverty. The city of Pozzuoli (Metropolitan area of Napoli) is the only city on South-Europe that succeeded to get, in the first round of the extremely competitive call for proposal, the EU financing named UIA (Urban Innovative Action). The project has the courage to propose ground-breaking solutions for very serious and persisting problems linked to urban poverty in the Monterusciello neighborhood. Innovation is embedded in applying the methodology of the permaculture to regenerate the public land available in between buildings of Monterusciello. Thirty hectares of Municipal open areas will be transformed into farmland, developed the innovative techniques of permaculture in order to spearhead an economic process and urban growth as a means to combat poverty. This Urban Agriculture led regeneration is based on a solid participatory planning process that aims to solve the many existing problems on the ground through learning and training actions (schools and youngster as priority target groups), experimentation of production chains at km zero, use of innovative and ecologic techniques in producing goods, design of cooperativistic a business model for the financial sustainability, relevant investment in advanced design of available public land and space, with a special focus on urban landscape related questions. This paper is presenting the urban regeneration adopted strategy in terms of ongoing and experimental planning practices, built up governance relations and creation of a sustainable (economic, socio-cultural; and environmental) development narrative for present and future development in Monterusciello.

Biodiversity offsets, as the last stage of the mitigation hierarchy, provide an opportunity to promote a more sustainable basis for development by addressing residual impacts and achieving "no net loss" for biodiversity. Despite debate around their effectiveness, biodiversity offsets are seeing increasing application on land but remain a rarely used tool in the marine environment. We assess how offsets can be applied in the marine environment to achieve better biodiversity outcomes, and identify implications for conservation policy and practice. For instance, spatial conservation planning provides opportunities to move away from a siloed, project-by-project, approach by pooling offsets on a regional scale. There are real differences between marine and terrestrial environments in relation to ecology, connectivity, data availability, management options, and impact perception, and marine offsets are therefore often regarded as challenging. However, fundamental offset principles, types, and approaches apply equally on land and at sea. Marine biodiversity offset approaches can build on the experience of terrestrial offsets but can also innovate to help achieve biodiversity gains and contribute toward global and national biodiversity targets.

J	Rydin, Y				Rydin, Yvonne			Indicators as a governmental technology? The lessons of community-based sustainability indicator projects	ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING D-SOCIETY & SPACE			English	Article							STATE; POWER; AUSTRALIA; POLITICS; POLICY	There has been much interest in the neo-Foucauldian framework of governmentality as a way of understanding contemporary policy processes. In this paper I examine evidence from a case study of local sustainability indicators in the light of this framework. The role of indicators as a potential governmental technology is addressed, covering issues of their ability to objectify sustainability, the scope for altered subjectivities, their positioning within central-local government relations, and the construction and responsibilisation of communities, particularly in urban regeneration contexts. I conclude that the use of indicators at the community level may tell us more about central-local relations within contemporary governance than about the construction of subjects and objects to enable governance with regard to sustainable development.

The Matter of Carbon: Understanding the Materiality of tCO(2)e in Carbon Offsets	ANTIPODE			English	Review						clean development mechanism; carbon offsets; socionature; commodification; neoliberalism; sustainable development; Honduras	POLITICAL ECOLOGY; MARKET ENVIRONMENTALISM; NEOLIBERALISING NATURE; CLEAN DEVELOPMENT; HOUSEHOLD STOVES; KYOTO PROTOCOL; GOVERNANCE; COMMODIFICATION; ACCUMULATION; GEOGRAPHIES	This paper examines the socio-natural relations inherent in the commodification of carbon reductions as they are generated in energy-based carbon offset project activities, and abstracted to wider market systems. The ability to commodify carbon reductions takes place through a socionatural-technical complex that is defined by the material nature of technology's interaction with the atmosphere, local social processes and the evolving governing systems of carbon markets. Carbon is not unproblematically commodified: some projects and technologies allow a more cooperative commodification than others. The examples of a hydroelectricity plant and an improved cookstove project in Honduras are used as empirical case studies to illustrate the difficulties and opportunities associated with the relational aspects of carbon commodification. Drawing upon select literatures from post-structural thought to complement the principal lens of a more structural, materiality of nature analysis, the paper also outlines the reasons why carbon offset reform is needed if offsets are to more progressively engage debates about climate mitigation and North-South development.

J	He, HM; Song, YC				He Hongmei; Song Yuchun			Current Situation and Trends of Poverty in Bangladesh	IPRI JOURNAL			English	Article						Bangladesh; Poverty Problems; Poverty Reduction		Poverty governance in developing countries constitutes an important part of global poverty governance as it is a major obstacle to the sustainable development of human society. Bangladesh has carried out numerous economic as well as trade liberalization reforms since the early 1990s with sustained and accelerated economic growth and formulated a series of measures to reduce poverty, with remarkable results. However, Bangladesh is still stuck in the paradox of a poverty trap regardless of achieving poverty reduction. The sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in 2019, gravely impacted the poverty reduction efforts made in Bangladesh, large number of poverty-stricken people returned to poverty, exceeding the number of extremely poor people. Although series of poverty reduction measures have taken place in Bangladesh, yet it has not solved the poverty problem in the country. Based on the "Household income and Expenditure Survey, released by Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, this paper analyzes the current situation and the development trend of poverty in Bangladesh by combining some international poverty indexes. Finally, the paper explains the actual poverty situation of Bangladesh, its causes,, and recommends some relevant measures.

J	Kissi, EA; Herzig, C				Kissi, Evans Appiah; Herzig, Christian			Methodologies and Perspectives in Research on Labour Relations in Global Agricultural Production Networks: A Review	JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES			English	Review							CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; FAIR-TRADE COFFEE; FOOD VALUE CHAINS; CUT FLOWER; ETHICAL TRADE; PRIVATE STANDARDS; SUPPLY CHAINS; SOUTH-AFRICA; SMALLHOLDER COOPERATIVES; SUSTAINABLE-DEVELOPMENT	The integration of Global South actors into the global agricultural economy has attracted research on labour effects. This is because Global South actors are often integrated at the level of production of raw materials with little power and less capture of gain. To better understand the conceptual perspectives and methodologies underpinning existing empirical studies and provide evidence for the labour-related practice, this paper conducts a systematic review of the methodologies and perspectives applied in the Global Agricultural Production Networks literature. Based on an analysis of 87 articles published in English-speaking journals, we show that the assessment of labour regulatory frameworks' impact on labour issues is more focused on private than public or social forms of governance and on vertical than horizontal frameworks. Wageworkers working on smallholder farms and agro-industries and women have received little consideration, in particular, if compared with wageworkers on plantations, as has the topic of occupational health and safety as a specific key labour issue. Overall, the existing body of empirical research can be characterised as being largely qualitative in nature, underexploiting the potential quantitative or mixed methods research designs. Our review generates methodological ideas and conceptual perspectives for future studies to consider.

The main purpose of our study is to help scholar communities distinguish between educational approaches that seek to sustain the "unsustainable" and to identify the problems of lecturer-student interaction in the midst of the mass transition to distance learning and to find ways to solve them. The results of our research show that the transition to distance education during the pandemic took place; however, it highlighted a whole complex of problems connected with deterioration of emotional state and reduction of incentives to study. That might challenge the existing status quo, a revision of the principles of "Humboldt universities" and the birth of new forms of education. The study consists of three parts that allow analyzing the lecturer-student relations, as well as the management of the learning process. The first part analyzes the characteristics and attitudes towards distance education in different countries. The second part presents the results of students' emotional state in two countries with different population restriction regimes. The third part is devoted to the study of students' time planning in the distance-learning environment. We used the following methods to achieve the goals of the study: a questionnaire survey of students and lecturers, HADS (The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and self-timing method. The thesis about the "gameover" in universities education management is open for discussion by the scientific community.

J	Jeon, S; Sarker, PK; Giessen, L				Jeon, Sohui; Sarker, Pradip Kumar; Giessen, Lukas			The Forest Policies of ASEAN and Montreal Process: Comparing Highly and Weakly Formalized Regional Regimes	FORESTS			English	Article						regional forest-related and forest-focused regimes; formalization; institutional design; forest policy development	INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN; COMMUNITY FORESTRY; PROCESS CRITERIA; GOVERNANCE; COMPLEX; STATE; INDONESIA; INSIGHTS; POWER; NATO	Forests are governed by a combination of sub-national and national as well as global and regional regimes. Comparing the institutional variation of regional regimes, including their degrees of formalization, is gaining attention of studies on regionalism in International Relations. This study attempts to analyse the ways in which the selected cases of the forest-related Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and forest-focused Montreal Process (MP) regional regimes may have synergetic overlaps or disparity in their institutional design and forest policy development. For this, we combined IR's 'rational institutional design' theory and a policy analysis approach. Using a qualitative data approach, we analyzed key structure-related historical regime documents (e.g., charters) issued since the inception of both regimes, and their latest forest policy initiatives for the periods 2016-2025 (Strategic Plan of Action for ASEAN Cooperation on Forestry) and 2009-2015 (Conceptual Framework for the Montreal Process Strategic Action Plan) with all relevant policy documents since the adoption of current policies. Based on that, we pose the empirical questions of how both regimes illustrate governance structure (i.e., institutional design), and on the other hand how to explain regime forest policies coherently and consistently in terms of their high versus low degree of formality. The results show that institutional design is highly explanatory based on treaty and non-treaty regime formation as well as forest-related/focused regime formation with the synergistic sustainable forest management (SFM) issue that embraces deforestation and forest degradation, biodiversity, timber certification, and greenhouse gas emission. Additionally, the results suggest that the policy goals adopted by both regimes are coherent and consistent based on the full set of policy elements. Concerning the remedy for fragmented global forest governance arrangements, both regimes would be an example of practicing SFM-focused policies with the incorporation of forest-related policy elements into a larger governance assemblage dealing with issues such as biodiversity conservation or climate change mitigation.

Exploring Communities of Learners in Swedish Preschool Provision	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EARLY CHILDHOOD			English	Article						Early childhood education and care for sustainability; Cultural historical activity theory; Communities of learners; Community; Sweden; Preschool	SCIENCE	In UNESCO's recent publication Education for Sustainable Development: A Roadmap the idea of community is described as playing an important role in the organization of education for sustainable development as a means of supporting transformations towards sustainability. In the present study we examine the relationship between community and the organization of Early Childhood Education and Care for Sustainability (ECECfS). This examination is based on case studies of Swedish preschool teachers' perspectives and practices in relation to ECECfS. Drawing on Cultural Historical Activity Theory and the concept of ontological Communities of Learners, we describe ways in which community-based characteristics of the preschools shape and are shaped by cultural tools used to pursue ECECfS. Themed-Project Work (TPW), a common means in Swedish preschools of organizing day-today activities, emerged as an important practice through which to examine questions of community within and across preschools. We describe organizational tensions concerning how pedagogical practices like TPW change from being tools to support a preschool's activities, to being objects toward which these activities are oriented. Such changes can enable or constrain a preschool's possibilities for building pluralistic and democratic ECEC environments. We also discuss how the said organizational tensions are rooted in how community is conceived of in preschool provision. Community is constituted not only through the relationships among members of individual preschools but also through the relationships that preschools have with other preschools in their administrative networks. We discuss contradictions that emerge in this matrix of relationships that shape how preschools enact good governance in the pursuit of ECECfS.

The acknowledgment that pure community management models will not reverse this trend is growing: RDWS users need support. In an attempt to further understanding what this support could look like we in particular zoom in on the role of public agencies. We ask, (i) what conditions explain variation in collective action among the end-users of an RDWS? and, (ii) what conditions explain variation in collaboration between RDWS end-users and a public agency? We lean on concepts and insights borrowed from the commons literature. After all, rural drinking water systems can be framed as a commons: its users face appropriation and above all provision dilemmas, that must be solved to avoid failure. Based on this literature we develop a list of enabling conditions for (i) collective action among RDWS end-users, and (ii) collaboration between RDWS end-users, and a public agency. We applied these lists to study the governance of 30 pond sand filter (PSF) systems in the Southwestern coastal area in Bangladesh. Computing correlation, we find that large group size, interdependency among the group members, heterogeneity of endowments, a high level of dependence on resource system, locally devised access and management rules and well-working collaboration between PSF users and the public agency are significantly associated with the occurrence of collective action among PSF users. We also find that the latter (i.e. collaboration between PSF users and the public agency) is positively influenced by transparency and inclusive decision-making procedures, but mostly by a relation that is characterized by trust.

This makes them vulnerable to economic change and national decision-making. We describe change in three secondary cities-Emalahleni, Matjhabeng and Newcastle-all at different phases of economic transition due to imminent mine closure. We investigate the way local governance and planning are dealing with the change. We draw on concepts from institutional economics and evolutionary governance theory, material from strategic planning documents, and approximately 50 key informant interviews. We show how difficult it is to steer economic planning during economic transitions, and we demonstrate how both economic change and governance are path-dependent. Path dependency in South Africa's mining towns has several causes: the colonial influence, which emphasised extraction and neglected beneficiation; the dominance of a single sector; the long-term problems created by mining; and the lack of the skills needed to bring about economic change. The local governments' continuing reliance on the New Public Management paradigm, which focuses on steering as opposed to building networks, compounds the problem, along with poor governance, inadequate local capacity and inappropriate intergovernmental relations. Of the three towns, only Newcastle has shown signs of taking a new path.

A proposed water sector plan for the Dr Kenneth Kaunda District Municipality (Dr KKDM)	TD-THE JOURNAL FOR TRANSDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH IN SOUTHERN AFRICA			English	Article						water; environment; water resource management; planning; coordination; public participation; integrated development plan; strategy; water services development plan; legislation; regulation		The radical reform of potable water services provisioning by means of promulgation of the Water Services Act 108 of 1997 and the National Water Act 36 of 1998 in South Africa (SA) started a process of addressing the imbalance which existed in how the national resource was distributed. Water is now recognised as a scarce resource that belongs to all the people of the country and consequently it should be managed in an integrated way for social and economic development including future growth (Fuggle and Rabie 2005: 293; Riemann, Chimboza and Fubesi 2012: 446). The provision of potable water by water services authorities (WSAs) is an important basic service that faces a number of challenges such as the use of out-dated infrastructure and a lack of skilled and knowledgeable people that place overt pressure on demand for service delivery. It is against this background that the researchers have undertaken to investigate how a municipality which is forced to obtain its potable water supply from nearby surface-and groundwater catchments, can manage it in a more effective, efficient, equal, economic and sustainable manner by means of improved planning procedures to enhance co-operative governance and intergovernmental relations. A qualitative research design was used to conduct the study, which included a literature review, semi-structured interviews, non-probability data sampling and scientific analyses of responses. Furthermore, a case-study approach was followed by the researchers, with Dr Kenneth Kaunda District Municipality (Dr KKDM) as the unit of analysis (the locus). The major research finding of the study included that a Water Sector Plan (WSP) was lacking and non-existent in the Dr Kenneth Kaunda District Municipality (Dr KKDM) and therefore water services delivery could not be coordinated effectively.

It speaks of a new world of globalized and manufactured risks where neither security nor environment can be interpreted or acted upon in traditional ways. In this paper we examine how debates on the Anthropocene unfold in global politics and how they challenge core assumptions in International Relations. Through a structured analysis of 52 peer-reviewed journal articles, we identify three Anthropocene discourses that speak of new environmental realities for global politics. These are referred to as the endangered world, the entangled world, and the extractivist world. While each discourse describes an increasingly interconnected and fragile world in which conventional binaries such as inside/outside, North/South and us/them can no longer be taken for granted, disagreement prevails over what needs to be secured and by whom.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN VENEZUELAN HOTELS	STUDIES IN BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						corporate social responsibility; local development; hotels; sociocultural dimension; Venezuela		This paper analyzes the role of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in the hotel sector of Merida State (Venezuela) and its contribution to the sociocultural dimension of local development. A theoretical framework is presented that supports the subsequent empirical analysis. Summary is made of the public policies related to CSR and the tourism sector, and the characteristics of the State of Merida where the tourism activity that is going to be analyzed is carried out. Next, the empirical part is developed. The managers of the hotels were surveyed, using a questionnaire adapted from indicators of the ETHOS Institute. Average values of the different items are obtained by dimensions, themes and indicators and a logistic regression model is applied. The Governance and Management dimension has high compliance with anti-corruption practices. In the Social dimension, three indicators are highly valued (relationship with consumers, monitoring the impact on human rights and relations with employees) and three less valued (support for the development of suppliers, commitment to the community and professional development). Additionally, three aspects of CSR contribute to the sociocultural dimension (vision and strategy, human rights and sustainable use of resources) and represent 58% of the larger hotels, with most category, and longest seniority.

Networks and Power: Why Networks are Hierarchical Not Flat and What Can Be Done About It	GLOBAL POLICY			English	Article							GOVERNANCE; MANAGEMENT	Many scholars, policy makers and practitioners associate new, networked forms of collaboration and governance with positive attributes such as speed, flexibility, adaptability and 'flatness'. This article contrasts the assumptions that networks essentially moderate external asymmetries of power with the network theoretical view that networks may amplify existing hierarchies. The case study network explored supports the network theoretical view that existing power relations may be increased when a multistakeholder partnership network is established. The use of Social Network Analysis facilitates the comparison of the structures and relationships into which global policy actors are organised (the formal network) with the relationships and relational structures into which they choose to organise themselves (informal network). In the conclusions, I introduce the practice of network rewiring that could overcome the network mechanisms that amplify existing power relations. Further research is required that adds more case study evidence in order to raise (and begin to answer) questions that will give a wider view of the social structuring of power in partnership networks in international development, such as those referred to in the recently-adopted Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

J	Tran, TA				Thong Anh Tran			From free to forced adaptation: A political ecology of the 'state-society-flood' nexus in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta	ASIA PACIFIC VIEWPOINT			English	Article						adaptation; flood management; human-environment interactions; political ecology; Vietnamese Mekong Delta	CLIMATE-CHANGE; INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT; KNOWLEDGE; RIVER; HOUSEHOLDS; SYSTEMS	This paper investigates the adaptation processes with reference to the narrative analysis of human-environment interactions in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. From the political ecology perspective, it focuses on the discourses of the power relationships embedded within the 'state-society-flood' nexus over the course of its 'opening-up and closing-off' processes (e.g. excavating large-scale canals for human settlements and agricultural expansion (opening-up) and human interventions into natural systems through water control structures (closing-off)). Drawing on empirical data gathered from 33 interviews and nine focus group discussions in three study areas and relevant literature, the paper argues that human interactions with the flood environments are intertwined with adjustments of adaptation patterns as evidenced through three periods: free adaptation (pre-1975), transitional adaptation (1976-2010) and forced adaptation (after 2010). These processes have witnessed a gradual power shift in the 'state-society' relations in manipulating floods, which moves from the top-down towards a more collaborative fashion. By unravelling the political ecology of the 'state-society-flood' nexus, this paper exhibits the skewed development in the delta, which is largely bound to short-term development planning to prioritise local socio-economic and political objectives. The paper contributes important policy implications for achieving socially just and environmentally sustainable development in the delta.

Considering the goals of developing and promoting an innovative territorial rural development approach, the bio-district can become a process toward a more sustainable model represented by the agroecological agriculture system. The paper presents a case study of the Parma bio-district through the approach of a Localized Agri Food System (LAFS) to verify whether bio-districts can be a tool for scaling up towards agroecology. Stakeholder classification and analysis are conducted using an influence-interest matrix. We identified four groups of stakeholders in relation to their interests and power to influence the process. In the case of the Parma bio-district the role of local institutions in dialogue with consumers and producers' associations is crucial for success. We conclude that bio-districts can be a tool for a scaling-up towards agroecology since they can facilitate a synergetic relation between organic and agroecological agriculture, spreading organic agriculture more widely around the local area. However, the involvement of a wide variety of different stakeholders means that governance is a key element in facilitating "cross fertilization" and preventing the process from becoming purely formulaic.

The aim of the paper is to check the validity of the Kuznets Environmental Curve (EKC - environmental Kuznets curve) in Croatia for the period 2004 to 2017. Kuznets environmental curve represents the relationship between certain parameters that negatively affect the environment and economic development. The environmental Kuznets curve starts from the hypothesis that increasing income, i.e. GDP, will increase environmental deterioration to a certain degree of development when degradation begins to decline. The results show that there is a linear link between these two variables in the observed period, but that the EKC hypothesis for waste cannot be confirmed on the example of Croatia. The study found that the turning point is very high compared to GDP in that period, suggesting the need to introduce a more ambitious waste management policy, introduce new technologies to establish long-term sustainable waste management and reduce the amount of waste produced.

J	Craiu, AA				Craiu, Albert Andrei			THE ROLE OF INTERINSTITUTIONAL PARTNERSHIPS IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS: THE CASE OF EDUCATIONAL POLICIES	EUROPOLITY-CONTINUITY AND CHANGE IN EUROPEAN GOVERNANCE			English	Article						Education; educational policy; Erasmus programme; international relationships; interinstitutional partnerships; public policies		The theme that I have chosen for that article is at the crossroads of public policies, educational policies and international relationships. It relies in the assumption that is not possible to have public policies at national level if they are not in consistent relation with international regulations, eg. at the European level. Therefore, along of this study, I will try to give a retrospective look at the measures implemented by Romania in the fields of education and youth at international, European and national levels, in order to have to meet the overall orientations of the educational system to the ideal one. To accomplish this, the paper aims to meet the following objectives to identify the changes at international, European and Romanian levels in the fields of education and youth from their mentioning in the official documents of the European Union. I will also try to identify and analyse projects that have had a major impact in both areas through the achievement of the objects pursued at the time of their development and various levels of implementation. The Lisbon Strategy, adopted in 2000 and revised in 2005, has as a common goal the development of the European Union as a competitive, dynamic, knowledge-based, global economy capable of sustainable economic growth with a significant increase in the number and quality of jobs available work, as well as greater social cohesion. The education objectives provided for a substantial increase in public spending in this area, the promotion of lifelong learning, the adaptation of basic skills to the needs of the knowledge society, and better recognition of qualifications. With the 2005 Lisbon Strategy Review, education and training have been among the priority areas of the European Union, emphasizing once again the importance of developing human capital as the main asset of Europe. This is one of the European orientations for policy in education. I will try to find and explain in this article some international directions for policy in education. I will also try to talk about which are the main issues of international education, among which an interesting subject is that of equality of educational opportunities.

Despite the varied analyses of the strictest water resources management policy, the relations between the strictest water resources management policy and water use efficiency remain under-researched. This study uses an interval event-analysis method to assess the strictest water resources management policy's impact on water use efficiency in China based on data from 2007 to 2020. In addition, the study breaks down water use efficiency into eight indicators and divides the strictest water management policy into "pre-, middle, and post-" phases. The research results show the strictest water resources management policy has a significant positive effect on water use efficiency. Further research shows the total water consumption control system and water efficiency control system have the most significant effect. The strictest water resources management policy has a lasting impact on water use efficiency. This study contributes to the global knowledge body of water governance and provides a reference value for water policy decision-making and optimization in other countries.

A power analysis of a transforming marine community around oil transshipment at St. Eustatius	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Marine community; Power; Governance; Small island environmental state; St. Eustatius		The strategic location of small islands in the Caribbean, close to the United States of America (USA), and their historical trade roots as former colonies of Europe make them an interesting business environment. Small islands' eagerness for economic development and their limited governance capacity often result in an unequal relationship between multinational private parties and small islands' policy actors, especially in regard to environmental management. This is also observed at St. Eustatius, a small Caribbean island that hosts a crucial oil storage and transshipment terminal that compromises the environmental state of the small island. However, in 2010, St. Eustatius (Statia) became part of the Netherlands, which significantly changed the responsibilities related to environmental management. Bringing the environmental state back in reversed existing power relations. To analyze these changing power dynamics, we apply the new social scientific concept of marine community, which encompasses a user community and a policy community and shows the different interests and power dynamics within and between them. While governance of the oil terminal used to be determined by structural power in the user community on behalf of NuStar, it currently relies on the structural power of the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment (I&E) in the policy community. In theory, structural power to bring the environmental state back in would be beneficial for governance. In practice, however, this is challenging because a small island environmental state is different from the environmental state in countries in Western societies. Although the Dutch Ministry has structural power, the way it relates to others (dispositional power) and uses resources (relational power) should be better adapted to the needs and characteristics of small island environmental states such as Statia.

In order to develop a holistic tool for organizational sustainability management, it is imperative to account for, and integrate, the sustainability best practices in the conceptual models. The primary objective of this work is to explore the organizational sustainability themes, functional areas, and the corresponding best practices of the most sustainable organizations. Based on the results, we aim to propose a framework which can support the theoretical models. The starting set of 100 most sustainable organizations is obtained through a well-defined sustainability ranking, Global 100. A systematic method is developed and applied to screen the organizational reports between 2012 and 2016. As a result, 61 reports of 20 organizations are selected for review. We used grounded mechanism to conduct the review. The results of the review indicate that the most sustainable organizations rely on the following nine themes to advance their sustainability performance: (i) resource optimization and minimization of waste and emissions; (ii) business and operational excellence; (iii) corporate citizenship and social development; (iv) research and innovation; (v) procurement, supply chain, and logistics; (vi) governance; (vii) sustainability management tools; (viii) employee relations; and (ix) health, wellness, safety, and security. In addition, there are around 38 functional areas which are of great significance to sustainability managers from an applied perspective and to researchers for constructing sustainability management models.

The theoretical basis for the paper is the commons conceptual framework in relation to both seed and plant genetic resources. This framework is applied to question the current policy ecosystem of genetic research and breeding and explore different collective governance models. The concept of crop diversity management system (CDMS) commons is proposed as the new foundation for a more holistic and inclusive framework for crop diversity management, that covers a broad range of concerns and requires different actors. The paper presents a multi-stakeholder process established within the context of the two recent projects CoEx and Dynaversity, imagining possible collective arrangements to overcome existing deadlocks, foster collective learning, and design collaborative relationships among genebanks, researchers, and farmers' civil society organizations involved in crop diversity management.

The data collected with this research provide important insights into public's opinion regarding current and potential issues in Turkey, and also guide policymakers in shaping the public policies. The outputs of this study may also encourage scholars and researchers from different fields and backgrounds to study and discuss public opinion with its complex dynamics and milieu of dimensions. This research delivers some of the most evocative and current issues in Turkey; the most important current problems, the economy, terror, the Kurdish issue, government and opposition parties' evaluations, political vacuum, institutional evaluations, political polarization/judicial system, democracy and social relations/change in Turkey. According to the survey, the Turkish public views "terrorism" as the most important problem facing the country. The most critical economic issues are determined as unemployment, depreciation of the Turkish lira. In addition to these, foreign policy approval rate and support for EU membership increased. While the media was again the least trusted institution, trust in institutions generally increased.

Apologists for growth: passive revolutionaries in a passive revolution	GLOBALIZATIONS			English	Article						Sustainable inclusive economic growth; productivism; military-industrial complex; poverty; post-development; social ecological economics	WORLDS ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS; EUGENICS; POLICY	Popular authors and international organizations recommend transformation to a 'new economy'. However, this is misleadingly interpreted as radical or revolutionary. Two problematic positions are revealed: being pro-growth while seeking to change the current form of capitalism (e.g. Ha-Joon Chang), and being anti-growth on environmental grounds but promoting growth for poverty alleviation and due to agnosticism about growth (e.g. Tim Jackson and Kate Raworth). Both positions involve contradictions and an evident failure to address, or perhaps even a denial of, the actual operations of capital accumulating economies. Thus, economists ostensibly critical of capitalism turn out to be apologists for growth who conform to the requirements of a top-down passive revolution, that leaves power relations undisturbed and the economic structure fundamentally unchanged. The growth economy is shown to include technocracy, productivism associated with eugenics, inequity disguised as meritocracy, competition concealing militarism and imperialism, imposition of development as progress, and financialization and commodification of Nature.

Holling [2]. However, they have attracted great attentions and interests, in both academia and urban governance, then in planning practice over recent years. The first two sections of this paper examine the term resilience in ecological systems, urban systems, in spatial planning and in urban design. Specific attention of the paper, introduced in the third part, is to investigate resilience in the context of drought-flood coexistence (DFC), revolving two key objects and their interactions: DFC and urban at regional scale. Flood and drought events, in their turns intertwine in natural correlation, which is also reviewed. These relationships are literally investigated, to prove that they interplay mutually with each other, and that once a city develops in relation with water cycle at a regional context, in arid zone, not only hydrological drought could be regionally decreased, but human-induced floods could be ecologically regulated. The study concludes in the fourth, together with lessons from relevant case studies in America, China, with some principles on spatial planning, resilient/adaptive to DFC, which could be ecologically managed in correlation with urban development on a sustainable pathway.

In this paper, determinants of energy efficiency and energy consumption for the panel of 11 post-communist countries in the Eastern Europe during 1996-2013 are investigated. The stochastic frontier function approach and comparative analysis were used to examine long-run dynamic relations. The research results show that GDP growth is a key factor increasing both energy efficiency and energy consumption. The research results on energy efficiency relations show that CO2 emissions per capita, a fixed capital and the share of industry in the economy are other important drives. In the context of per capita energy consumption growth, the factors of structural changes determined by industry share in the national economy and innovation concerned with development and implementation of high technologies are significant. The European Union accession and participation in the European energy policy promote to energy efficiency improvements in the post-communist countries while progress in governance and enterprise restructuring as measured by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is not important for energy efficiency and per capita energy consumption in the post-communist countries. According to the research results, energy efficiency policy in the sample countries should be aimed at providing further economic growth enhancing a positive impact of other factors and implementing energy efficiency projects.

J	Hodson, M; Marvin, S				Hodson, Mike; Marvin, Simon			Understanding the role of the national exemplar in constructing 'strategic glurbanization'	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN AND REGIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article							ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE; ENTREPRENEURIAL CITY; URBAN GOVERNANCE; POLITICS; LONDON; POLICY; STATE	This article focuses on the tensions between economic and environmental priorities through attempts to reconfigure urban governance arrangements in a world city. We examine these tensions through the development of the hydrogen energy economy in London and through attempts to cultivate new techniques of governance in realizing this vision. Through case study material, we develop two representations of the negotiation of new forms of governance. First, we outline the representation of 'London as world leader in progressive urban governance'. Second, we develop a characterization of 'the politics of the world city in CO2 reduction'. The article moves on to address the scalar making up of these representations, in relation to and through analysing multiple interpretations of London as a 'national exemplar'. The active positioning and representation of London as the exemplar by the national state and the specificities of London governance, we claim, enables the mayor to actively negotiate between the two sets of apparently conflicting logics of hydrogen development. London's energy strategy is therefore to a large extent 'nationalized' while at the same time national energy policy is also regionalized around London. Consequently, London is differentially and positively positioned in comparison to other city-regions of the UK. The need to develop a sustainability fix that can allow London, and the greater South East of England, to continue to grow economically and within the apparent constraints of environmental limits requires a specific governance fix around the national exemplar and new socio-technical energy networks, which we characterize as 'strategic glurbanization'.

We then test whether royal family directors affect this relation. Using a dataset from six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, we find evidence that analysts' recommendations are influenced by ESG information. Further, we find the political connection negatively moderates the relationship between sell-side analysts' recommendations and ESG. This suggests that financial analysts may assess the ESG disclosure in those firms with the political connection of royalty, in GCC countries, as superficial compliance rather than a genuine commitment. Our results are robust when subjected to endogeneity tests.

J	Roberts, A				Roberts, Adrienne			Privatizing social reproduction: The primitive accumulation of water in an era of neoliberalism	ANTIPODE			English	Article						primitive accumulation; social reproduction; neoliberalism; water privatization; commodification	DISPOSSESSION; MARKET; STATE; MATERIALITY; CITIZENSHIP; GOVERNANCE; ENGLAND; GENDER; SPACES; RIGHTS	Recent years have witnessed a resurgence of critical works seeking to extend Karl Marx's radical understanding of "primitive accumulation" in order to describe the increasing penetration of capital into new spaces and social relations in the contemporary era of neoliberal globalization. This paper will argue that the intensification of the corn modification of water may be understood as an ongoing mechanism of primitive accumulation and that this process generates contradictions and tensions not solely for capitalist relations of production, but more crucially, for relations of social reproduction. Further, while recent years have witnessed the emergence of a new discourse on water governance that advocates a more active role for governments in the water sector and for the incorporation of the "voices" of women and the poor in the development of sustainable and equitable water policies, this new discourse ultimately remains informed by neoliberalism's individualist ontology and its material and discursive dedication to economic growth above broader social considerations.

J	Nasiritousi, N; Hjerpe, M; Baeckstrand, K				Nasiritousi, Naghmeh; Hjerpe, Mattias; Baeckstrand, Karin			Normative arguments for non-state actor participation in international policymaking processes: Functionalism, neocorporatism or democratic pluralism?	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS			English	Article						Climate change; global governance; legitimacy; non-state actors	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CIVIL-SOCIETY; SIDE-EVENTS; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; EPISTEMIC COMMUNITIES; WORLD SUMMIT; LEGITIMACY; NGOS; NEGOTIATIONS	The participation of non-state actors in multilateral institutions is often portrayed as one way of decreasing the perceived legitimacy deficit in global governance. The literature on non-state actors has identified several ways in which these actors can enhance the legitimacy of intergovernmental organisations and global governance arrangements. Three partially competing normative arguments, or rationales, for the inclusion of non-state actors in international policymaking functionalism, neocorporatism and democratic pluralism have been identified. Whereas functionalism highlights the contribution of non-state actors to output legitimacy in terms of expertise, neocorporatism emphasises the inclusion of affected interests, and democratic pluralism claims that non-state actors increase input legitimacy through procedural values. These three normative arguments thus offer different understandings of the motives for the inclusion and representation of non-state actors in international negotiations and diplomacy. Through a single case study of United Nations climate diplomacy, we analyse the extent to which the three rationales for non-state actor inclusion are found in views held by state and non-state actors participating in the annual United Nations climate change conferences. Our results show that different actor groups place varying degrees of emphasis on the different rationales for non-state actor inclusion, even though the neocorporatist rationale remains most favoured overall. We discuss the implications of our findings for the democratic legitimacy of increasing participation of non-state actors in intergovernmental affairs and recent trends in the participation of non-state actors in the international climate change policymaking process.

To resolve the problem, we argued that there are chained mediating relationships among other factors in the absorptive-performance relationship. Data were collected from 522 new product development teams in top 30 consumer electronics manufacturers in Taiwan. Structural equation modeling results revealed that: first, absorptive capacity positively influences team knowledge sharing, which positively influences both cooperation and competition (sharing-stimulated co-opetition), which then lead to increased team effectiveness. This study is among the first to contribute by investigating absorptive capacity's impact on team-level effectiveness; it achieved this by examining the abovementioned mediating relationships. Practically, we found that absorptive capacity could be influential on team effectiveness, if the team exercise good knowledge sharing activities that in turn stimulate co-opetition relations among workers. Collectively, the dynamics of absorptive capacity, knowledge sharing, and co-opetition can form a positive circle for a team's sustainable effectiveness.

J	Tewdwr-Jones, M				Tewdwr-Jones, M			Planning and the National Assembly for Wales: Generating distinctiveness and inclusiveness in a new political context	EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES			English	Article							GOVERNANCE; GOVERNMENT	The creation of the National Assembly for Wales in May 1999 was part of a series of constitutional reforms in the UK initiated by the Labour Government after 1997. The Assembly, that has been awarded policy-making powers only, is still in its infancy, and any assessment of the perceived success of the new forum would be premature. Nevertheless, there are signs emerging that could give rise to the view that the Assembly will carve out a degree of distinctiveness in its approach to governance and substantive policy areas compared to that operating in England generally, and to the land use planning system in particular. This review paper charts the birth of the National Assembly for Wales, outlines its responsibilities and functions in relation to planning, and assesses what has happened 'on the ground' in its first 18 months. Overall, the paper portrays politicians and officials in the new governance framework searching for distinctiveness, inclusiveness and policy ownership; the task is to offer something different compared both to the system existing previously and to the on-going processes of institutional restructuring underway in other parts of the UK. It situates planning within the crucible of decentralization and devolution, since planning has been awarded a central facilitating role within the governance and restructuring process as part of the Welsh Cabinet's determination to deliver sustainable development in the twenty-first century.

J	Kornec, R				Kornec, Radoslaw			THE ROLE OF STAKEHOLDERS IN SHAPING SMART SOLUTIONS IN POLISH CITIES	ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES			English	Article						cities; stakeholders; sustainable city; smart city	E-GOVERNMENT; CITY; METHODOLOGY; TRENDS; MODEL	Nowadays, cities are approached as complex systems comprising multiple interactions and interrelations. At present, urbanisation is one of the principal socio-economic global processes. Population concentration and myriad different relations between entities lead to highly complicated lives within the urban space. Therefore, the characteristics features of modern cities refer not only to their physical structures, but also to the network of cyber-relations optimising processes occurring within agglomerations. The aims of public governance in urban space relating to the development of intelligent, sharp solutions regarding life quality improvement are undeniably associated with the application of modern technologies. However, one must also take into consideration the role and impact of various stakeholders affecting the process of smart city development. According to the results, stakeholders' involvement is crucial for good management. It is believed that the greatest role in the implementation of intelligent solutions is played by local self-governments. Their leading function is highlighted at the following stages: project conceptualization, implementation and management. Political entities of a more extensive coverage as well as local communities, economic entities and research institutions also play essential role at the stage of concept development. This study focuses on the importance of individual interest groups in the process of shaping intelligent solutions in the urban space. The study is divided into the following sections: Introduction, Literature Review, Methodology, Research Results, and Conclusions.

J	Kamphof, R; Melissen, J				Kamphof, Ries; Melissen, Jan			SDGs, Foreign Ministries and the Art of Partnering with the Private Sector	GLOBAL POLICY			English	Article							MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; BUSINESS DIPLOMACY; PUBLIC DIPLOMACY; PARTNERSHIPS; PERSPECTIVE; GOVERNANCE	Government policies supporting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and sustainability criteria, as well as commercial goals, aim at an enabling multi-actor environment. However, they do not prevent friction, lack of mutual understanding and cultural clashes with the private sector. We argue that this relational issue is a considerable and relatively neglected concern, albeit readily recognized by practitioners, and is potentially obstructing the achievement of the United Nations' 2030 Agenda and the SDGs. It also deserves more scholarly attention. In articulating and discussing public-private relations, in this exploratory project we point to a theoretical challenge that touches on the ontological and epistemological core of international studies. Apart from analysing relevant literatures, we have benefited from varied data collection with input from policy makers, diplomats, business representatives and consulted experts across cultures. Our starting point is that public-private partnerships that are necessary to reach the targets of the UN's 2030 Agenda pose a test for ministries of foreign affairs (MFAs). These new kinds of SDG partnerships differ from early 21st-century public-private partnerships (PPPs) in the field of development cooperation. Leaving aside risk factors facing companies in our research, we identify three main SDG partnership puzzles for government. Maximizing diplomats' relations with the corporate sector should rank high on the list of requirements for 21st-century diplomatic effectiveness.

Towards A Situated Urban Political Ecology Analysis of Packaged Drinking Water Supply	WATER			English	Article						urban water infrastructure; political ecology; water governance; water quality; packaged drinking water (PDW); bottled water; Jakarta; Indonesia	BOTTLED WATER; INEQUALITIES; CONSUMPTION; SERVICES	The inclusion of packaged drinking water (PDW) as a potentially improved source of safe drinking water under Goal 6.1 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) reflects its growing significance in cities where piped water has never been universal or safe for drinking. Using the case of PDW in Jakarta, Indonesia, we call for theorizing the politics of PDW through a situated Urban Political Ecology (UPE) analysis of the wider urban water distributions in which it is inserted. We do so in order to interrogate the unevenness of individual choices for securing safe drinking water, and highlight the ambiguity of PDW's impact on inequalities in access. We first review research on PDW supply to specify how dominant theoretical approaches used for understanding PDW supply through analyses of the individual making choices for drinking water are power neutral, and why this matters for achieving equitable water access. We illustrate these points through a case study of PDW consumption by low income residents in Jakarta, and then identify how a situated UPE framework can help attend to the uneven societal relations shaping different socio-material conditions, within which individual choices for PDW are made. For Jakarta, connecting choices of the individual to power relations shaping geographies of urban water access and risk explains the rise in PDW consumption by low income residents as a situated response to the uneven exposure of poorer residents to environmental hazards. We conclude with reflections on how this can inform interventions towards more just distributions of safe drinking water.

This paper focuses on the impact of government subsidies on enterprise green innovation, as well as the moderating role of ownership concentration on the relationship. Using China's data on high-tech enterprises listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen from 2011 to 2016, the hypotheses are tested. The results suggest that: government subsidies effectively improve the enterprises green innovation performance; ownership concentration displays a positively U-shaped effect in relation to green innovation; equity concentration has an inverted U-shaped moderating effect on the relationship between government subsidies and green innovation performance. Moreover, the baseline conclusions applied to SOEs do not apply to non-SOEs. Thus, an integrated framework of public supported resources and internal governance is built to improve the efficiency of government subsidies to develop green new technologies and ultimately promote the sustainability of the environment.

This study analyzes the degree of involvement of marine tourism companies in human resource management, adaptation to change, environmental management, local community development and collaboration with public and private agents. These areas configure companies' Corporate Social Responsibility strategies. Information was collected from marine tourism companies on the island of Tenerife using quantitative and qualitative methodologies. A binary logistic regression analysis was applied. The results indicate that, in general, marine tourism companies are socio-environmentally responsible. Environmental aspects and adaptation to change through innovation have the greatest weight in these companies' Corporate Social Responsibility strategies. Actions for local community development and collaboration with private agents are also important. However, human resource management influences negatively since marine tourism is a highly regulated sector in this regard. Thus, actions are mandatory and not voluntary, affecting all companies equally whether they have high levels of Corporate Social Responsibility implementation or not. Regarding relations with public authorities, the results indicate that improvement is urgently required, given the low participation of marine tourism companies in policy making.

J	Broto, VC; Allen, A; Rapoport, E				Broto, Vanesa Castan; Allen, Adriana; Rapoport, Elizabeth			Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Urban Metabolism	JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						industrial ecology; political economy; social ecology; urban ecology; urban metabolism; urban planning	POLITICAL ECOLOGY; BUILT ENVIRONMENT; SUSTAINABILITY; WATER; CITY; ENERGY; INFRASTRUCTURES; PRIVATIZATION; URBANIZATION; ECOSYSTEM	The concept of urban metabolism, referring to the exchange processes that produce the urban environment, has inspired new ways of thinking about how cities can be made sustainable and has also raised criticisms about the specific social and economic arrangements in which some forms of flow are prioritized or marginalized within the city. This article explores how the concept of urban metabolism travels across disciplines, using a comparative analysis of different approaches to urban metabolism within industrial ecology, urban ecology, ecological economics, political economy and political ecology. The analysis reveals six main themes emerging within interdisciplinary boundaries in relation to urban metabolism, and how this concept enables new understandings of (1) the city as an ecosystem, (2) material and energy flows within the city, (3) economic-material relations within the city, (4) economic drivers of rural-urban relationships, (5) the reproduction of urban inequality, and (6) attempts at resignifying the city through new visions of socioecological relationships. The article suggests potential areas for cross-disciplinary synergies around the concept of urban metabolism and opens up avenues for industrial ecology to engage with the politics and the governance of urban development by examining the city and its metabolism.

Temporal patterns of adoption of mariculture innovation globally	NATURE SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article							AQUACULTURE DEVELOPMENT; R-PACKAGE; DIFFUSION; ECOSYSTEM; MANAGEMENT; BENEFITS; COASTAL; PEOPLE; SPACE	Mariculture-farming seafood in the ocean-has been expanding in many countries and has the potential to be a critical component of a sustainable global food system. However, it has developed inconsistently across the globe, with minimal development in some regions, while in others intensive growth threatens sustainability. There is no overall understanding of trajectories of mariculture development around the world. We analyse mariculture development trends at the country level, drawing on diffusion of innovation theory. We show that most countries follow predictable patterns of development that are associated with key economic and governance indicators, such as regulatory quality. We also show that production of some taxa (for example, molluscs) is more strongly associated with stable production over time, as is growing a diversity of species. Taken together, our results suggest that enabling policies may unlock mariculture growth opportunities and that strategies that emphasize production of a diversity of species could contribute to a more stable mariculture industry. Further, by assessing each country's trajectory of mariculture development in relation to its production potential, we consider the limits and opportunities for future mariculture growth and its contribution to sustainable food systems.

Modeling Complex Financial Sustainability of a Corporation in the Age of Global Economic Crises	ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CHANGES-FACTS TRENDS FORECAST			English	Article						financial crisis; economic growth; economic development; financial stability; financial modeling; financial condition	CYCLE	Currently, the socio-economic content of the concept of sustainable development in relation to enterprises and corporations is actually replaced by a system of managing financial risks of investment, the effect of which aims to prevent a financial crisis. Major financial strategies ceased to be functional; they acquired a role comparable to the corporate economic strategy, and began to control the establishment of criteria of risks and the feasibility of enterprise's existence. The goal of the present research is to provide methodological support to the process of returning the priority of the financial concept of sustainable development from the sphere of financial growth (permanent capital growth) to the sphere of financial and economic development, by offering a new analytical tool of strategic level that does not contradict the interests of large businesses in its application. Taking into account the great contribution of transnational corporations to the initiation of global crises implemented with the help of stock market tools, the version of the financial-analytical method (visual modeling), which we present in the paper, reduces the dependence of corporate governance on the financial market assessment and directs risk management process in the field of real capital management of associations of enterprises. Stability of development based on the model is achieved by the programmability of the process of changing the special types in the development of complex financial stability, which is a key difference from the existing developments. Gradual qualitative development of a corporation with controlled destabilization rather than the general criterion of capital growth is the target for the formation of strategic and programmable sequences of the onset of complex profiles of financial stability. The sphere of corporate financial management of service enterprises can be considered as the scope of application of the results obtained. At further adaptation of the modeling results it is possible to use the modeling in the management of large corporate associations of practically any branch. The scale of application of the model is connected with the prospects of development of research in this direction.

RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS			English	Review						Carbon dioxide emissions per kWh; Electricity generation; Environmental Kuznets Curve; Innovative accounting approach; Panel cointegration tests; Renewable energy	CONSUMPTION-GROWTH NEXUS; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; NONRENEWABLE ENERGY; INDUSTRIAL-PRODUCTION; CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP; ERROR-CORRECTION; EMISSIONS; COINTEGRATION; OUTPUT; TESTS	The present study examines the long and short-run causality of the share of renewable energy sources (RES) in the relation between Carbon Dioxide emissions of electricity generation (CO2 kW h) and real income (GDP) for 20 European countries over 1991-2010, and in sub period 2001-2010. We used Co-integration Analysis and the Innovative Accounting Approach that includes Forecast Error Variance Decomposition and Impulse Response Functions (IRFs). Our results provide supportive evidence for the validity of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC), and suggest that renewable energy can be a potential determining driver of the difference in the emissions-income relations across European countries and a significant way of reducing CO2 kW h. Moreover, in this particular 2001-2010 subperiod the share of renewable energy in electricity output will have significant influence on the shape of the EKC, which will shift downward as RES increases, suggesting lower (environmental) costs of development. In these sub period, 2001-2010, all the results show a common pattern expected of CO2 emissions in electricity generation after the European Directive 2001/77/EC, and reveal the importance of the interactive impact of renewable energy sources and GDP to reduce the CO2 emissions in electricity generation.

A systematic analysis of power imbalances in food systems is required if we are to meet the 2030 Agenda vision of promoting sustainable production and consumption patterns and ending hunger and poverty. Such an analysis, with a view to a transformation to more sustainable and just food systems, requires tools to be developed and tested in real-life case studies of food systems. To better understand the structures and mechanisms around power in food systems, this study applies a political ecology lens. We adapted the power cube analysis framework that was proposed by the Institute of Development Studies for the analysis of spaces, forms, and levels of power. We apply the analysis of these three dimensions of power to two food systems in the tropical lowlands of Bolivia: one agroindustrial and one indigenous. After identifying food system actors, the food system spaces in which they interact, and what forms of power they use at what levels, we discuss some implications for an emerging scientific culture of power analyses in critical sustainability assessments. Mechanisms of hidden power undermine visible legislative power in both case studies, but in our example of an indigenous food system of the Guarani people, visible power stays with a local community through their legally recognized and communally owned and governed territory, with important implications for the realization of the right to food.

Forest management planning at different geographic levels in Italy: hierarchy, current tools and ongoing development	INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW			English	Article						sustainable forest management; national forest program; regional and sub-regional forest program; local management plans; multi-level governance	PROGRAMS; CONTEXT; POLICY	This paper examines the current status of forest management tools and their application at different levels in Italy where the majority of land planning has been and is still being done at the "micro-scale", meaning that specific local issues are dealt with locally. Starting from international European Union law. the authors review the forest acts that led from the National Forest Plan (NFP) to smaller scales, in relation to their geographic and territorial applicability. Scaling down from the NFP to the local level the various Italian forest programmes and plans are analysed according to a vertical logic (hierarchical mode): Regional Forest Programme (RFP), Territorial (i.e. sub-regional) Forest Plan (TFP), Local Forest Plans (LFPs). Then, in a horizontal logic, it is highlighted the importance of an intersectorial and harmonic relational frame among planning tools for the forest and other sectors of environmental planning As a result of these analyses, the authors emphasize the need for a new systematic holistic approach to the management of forests and environmental resources in general, and in line with all the most important processes at international level on this matter.

J	Le Heron, E				Le Heron, Erena			Snail assemblages: interrogating an environmental controversy involving Powelliphanta augusta and the mining industry in Aotearoa New Zealand	GEOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						assemblage; materiality; values and valuing; environmental controversy; snails (Powelliphanta augusta); Aotearoa New Zealand	KNOWLEDGE CONTROVERSIES; THINKING; SCIENCE	In 2004, a controversy arose in Aotearoa New Zealand's coal mining sector that involved Powelliphanta augusta, a species of land snail. This paper considers that controversy in terms of emergent assemblages involving the snail, the mining industry, the Department of Conservation, political action by environmental non-government organisations, and public expressions of environmental and other values. Three sets of relations embedded in those assemblages are examined-those related to positioning and organising nature; values, politics, and power relations; and human and non-human materialities. Those relations illuminate how a protracted controversy and its objects form a "social test bed" for contested views in legislation and guidelines dealing with economy, conservation, and restoration. To assess the dynamics, complexities, and contingencies of such relations, attention is paid to the controversy's detailed time line and legal framing, as well as to ontological shifts of snail and habitat and snail metrics. This analytical focus highlights the shifting quality of ideas about how the snail and its habitat are understood as entangled in fraught and mutating strategies of translocation that are played out in a particular regulatory setting. It also provides insights into international geographical efforts to re-shape environmental governance and management.

J	Bozhkov, E; Walker, C; McCourt, V; Castleden, H				Bozhkov, Elissa; Walker, Chad; McCourt, Vanessa; Castleden, Heather			Are the natural sciences ready for truth, healing, and reconciliation with Indigenous peoples in Canada? Exploring 'settler readiness' at a world-class freshwater research station	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES AND SCIENCES			English	Article						Truth and reconciliation; Water science; Indigenous knowledge; Indigenous-settler relations; Environmental management; Two-Eyed Seeing	KNOWLEDGE SYSTEMS; GOVERNANCE; SUSTAINABILITY; COMMUNITIES; IGNORANCE	The Experimental Lakes Area in Northwestern Ontario, Canada, is a globally prominent freshwater research facility, conducting impactful whole-of-lake experiments on so-called 'pristine' lakes and watersheds. These lakes are located in traditional Anishinaabe (Indigenous) territory and the home of 28 Treaty #3 Nations, something rarely acknowledged until now. Indeed, Indigenous peoples in the area have historically been excluded from the research facility's governance and research. Shortly after it changed hands in 2014-from the federal government to the not-for-profit International Institute of Sustainable Development (IISD)-the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) of Canada released its Calls to Action to all Canadians. The newly named International Institute of Sustainable Development-Experimental Lakes Area (IISD-ELA) began to respond with a number of initiatives aimed to develop relationships with local Indigenous peoples and communities. In this paper, from the perspectives of IISD-ELA staff members, we share findings from an exploratory study into the relationships beginning to develop between IISD-ELA and Treaty #3 Nations. We used semi-structured interviews (n = 10) to identify how staff perceived their initial efforts and contextualize those with the current literature on meaningfully engagement in reconciliation. Our analysis highlights perceived barriers, including time, resources, and funding constraints, as well as an acknowledged lack of cultural awareness and sensitivity training. Participants also recognized the need to engage Indigenous knowledge holders and embrace their ways of knowing at the research station. While the study is small in scale, as an international leader in freshwater science, transparency in the IISD-ELA's journey in reconciliation has the potential to inform, influence, and 'unsettle' settler-colonial scientists, field stations, and institutions across the country and beyond.

J	Benidickson, J				Benidickson, Jamie			The Evolution of Canadian Water Law and Policy: Securing Safe and Sustainable Abundance	MCGILL INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT LAW AND POLICY			English	Article							GOVERNANCE; PROVINCES; CRISIS	Canadian water law has evolved over an extended period of time as a complex mixture of federal and provincial legislation and case law with provincial arrangements influenced by both riparian and prior appropriation doctrine as well as by the civil law tradition of Quebec. The article reviews highlights from the long-term evolution of Canadian water law, policy and institutions following a chronological path from Confederation in 1867 to the present. Three key shifts that have more recently begun to appear in background assumptions of Canadian water law are then identified. In particular, it is noted (1) that general confidence in the abundance of water is giving way to concerns over security and occasional scarcity, (2) that the primacy of human water uses is gradually being moderated by acknowledgement of the importance of environmental flows, and (3) that international considerations may be relevant to a greater degree than previously contemplated. The concluding section of the paper presents emerging policy directions in relation to the legacy of historic water law and policy decisions and the shifting assumptions previously reviewed with emphasis on sustainability, conservation initiatives and watershed frameworks.

RBMP were intended to be produced for the periods 2009-2015, 2016-2021 and 2022-2027. However, after two years of delays in the development processes, the Republic of Ireland produced its first RBMP in 2010. The second RBMP cycle was also implemented in 2018 and is expected to run until the end of 2021 to give way to the third RBMP, whose consultation processes have been ongoing since December 2019. This paper contributes to the forthcoming RBMP by assessing stakeholders' perspectives on the second RBMP through a desk-based review and by conducting interviews with nine institutions (14 interviewees). The qualitatively analysed interviews reveal a broad spectrum of actors associated with water management and governance in the Republic of Ireland through a three-tier governance structure that has been delivered (with amendment) through the first two RBMPs. Organisations such as the An Foram Uisce|The Water Forum, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Local Authority Waters, and the Agricultural Sustainability Support and Advisory Programme have responsibilities designated in the RBMPs to deliver improved water quality, integrated catchment management, community engagement and awareness-raising. Trust has also been building up among these organisations and other agencies in the water sector. Despite these responsibilities and progress made, the interviews identified communication lapses, ineffective collaboration and coordination among stakeholders and late implementation to be hampering the successful delivery of the second RBMP, in addition to significant pressures acting on water bodies from agricultural activities and urban wastewater treatment. Towards the third RBMP, the paper concludes that optimised water sector finance, enhanced and well-resourced communications, and improved stakeholder collaboration are needed to foster effective and efficient water services delivery and quality. More so, given the cross-cutting impact of the Sustainable Development Goals on water resources and the interconnected relations among the goals, the paper further recommends the integration of the SDGs in the various plans of actions and a co-benefits approach to derive the triple benefits from biodiversity, climate change initiatives and water quality measures.

During that period, the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) failed to implement important structural reforms to diversify the economy and ensure economic stability. The absence of a strong local private sector, independent from government-led economic activity. hindered the potential for the region to become completely self-reliant. Due to the liberal economic framework and insufficient government capacity to oversee private sector operations, foreign corporations could operate in the area without deliberately contributing to the long-term socioeconomic development of the KRI. For the viability of South Kurdistan, the KRG must require foreign corporations operating in the KRI to move beyond simple 'do no harm' approaches and actively engage in conflict sensitive practices including inclusive business practices, sustainable human resource management, environmental sustainability, human capital development, and social investments.

Sustainability ethics in tourism: the imperative next imperative	TOURISM RECREATION RESEARCH			English	Article						Sustainability ethics; tourism; sustainability relations; meta-structures; Fiji	CONSUMERISM; MOTIVATION; GOVERNANCE; NEED	The purpose of this article is to provide a summary of Christian Becker's (2012) model of sustainability ethics, and secondly, to indicate what sustainability ethics would look like in tourism, using this model. Becker's primary focus is recognition of the inherent ethical dimension in sustainability. What underlies all of the various issues, problems, and challenges in sustainable development, therefore, is the belief that we are really faced with is a series of ethical challenges both in research and practice. Three main elements of this model are discussed. These include (1) relations to other contemporaries, i.e. people of the present day, future generations, and our relationship with nature; (2) finding the right type of ethics that fits with the demands of ethical beings and systems now and in the future; and (3) a discussion of the broad and complex social and global systems, meta-structures, that play an important role in how people relate to each other and the natural world. The case of the Upper Navua River, Fiji, is used as an example of how Becker's model can be used in tourism practice.

In decision making, they are often adopted to operate representations of central features of reality, highlighting rules and trade-offs, knowledge and learning-by-doing, motivations and negotiation processes. This study applies an RPS to investigate the mechanisms of activation of ecosystem services (ES) flow, as a result of co-production of the actors involved in a decision-making process. Against a common setting and predetermined objectives, arrangements negotiating ES and associated motivations are analyzed in relation to the RPS characters and their roles in the ES flow. This study applies a comparative experimental approach to support a transnational capacity-building process on sustainable local development through renewable energy sources. The RPS was replicated in 10 sessions in eight Southeast European countries, with almost 230 participants from marginal rural landscapes. From the results, we highlight the variability of the selection of ES, and the arrangements and motivations within each RPS session. ES arrangements emerge from group-based decision-making processes, where pools of players are pivotal in analyzing, assessing, and orienting decisions, beyond pre-existing expert knowledge on ES. Strengths and limitations of the method are discussed in the context of simulation practices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This article analyzes the attempts to guarantee the sustainable production of palm oil and agrofuels through voluntary certification schemes such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) from a critical state and hegemony theory perspective. Rather than seeing the RSPO as a voluntary and nongovernmental instrument that represents the interests of all concerned stakeholders equally, I analyze the roundtable as part of a transnational network state that is characterized by strategic selectivities, that is, some interests and strategies are privileged over others. Based on expert interviews in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore and the analysis of primary documents I conclude that the RSPO privileges business interests in general and export-oriented palm oil companies and downstream industries along the value chain in particular, whereas smallholders, plantation workers, and indigenous peoples are marginalized through different structures and processes, contributing to an actual depoliticization of socioecological conflicts.

We develop this framework to analyze institutional reconfiguration to enhance sustainability, and operationalize it using research methods which focus on documentation of the institutional contexts through an extensive literature review and interviews of experts in forest policy. We apply the Institutional Analysis and Reconfiguration Framework to examine forestry institutions, address forest governance, and investigate their effect on socio-economic and environmental performances in forestry of Ukraine. The paper draws on the state of affairs in post-transition forestry, its difficulties, and new prospects for economic and institutional reforms. We examine challenges and opportunities in forestry and suggest key remedies and prospective ways forward. Results show that a combination of path dependency with the rigidity of institutions and a slow pace of economic and political reforms is the major obstacle to implementing decisions regarding sustainable forest policy. A reconfiguration of social practices is required, as well as the development of capabilities and awareness raising amongst relevant stakeholders, to realize the problems, envision alternative futures, challenge existing institutions, shift power relations and create new norms, rules, and decision-making arrangements. The way towards sustainability in forestry largely goes through changing institutions, and a human dimension of institutional changes reflected in the uptake of social innovation.

J	Caria, S				Caria, Sara			Cooperation Regimes and Hegemonic Struggle: Opportunities and Challenges for Developing Countries	POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE			English	Article						2030 Agenda; development cooperation; hegemony; liberal order; Global South; South-South cooperation	DEVELOPMENT GOALS; BELT; AID	There is an increasing convergence in the international relations literature around the idea that changes in the world econ- omy during the last decades are reshaping the international order; although the outcome of such a reconfiguration is yet unclear, many scholars argue that a dispute over global hegemony is already underway. At the same time, drawing on realist and neorealist approaches, international cooperation can be seen as a means to gain legitimacy and tighten alliances. In this framework, this article analyses three cooperation regimes as terrains of dispute to expand-or maintain-international leadership. The first, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Agenda, reflects mainly the attempt to maintain the legit- imacy of the United Nations system and the multilateral institutions that make up the traditional cooperation regime. This framework still responds to Western interests, despite China's efforts to contest and contain US influence. The second, South-South Cooperation, wrapped up in the rhetoric of horizontality and common challenges, is the privileged terrain of middle powers and emerging countries, aiming at increasing regional influence. Finally, the third scheme, International Cooperation for Structural Transformation, is China's new development doctrine and the fulcrum of its struggle to pro- mote itself as a successful new model for global development. In my conclusions I reflect on the opportunities that the co-existence of different regimes offers for developing countries, as well as the challenges that they continue to face in their search for autonomous development paths.

Referring to the peri-urban areas surrounding Municipality of Prato (Tuscany -Italy), we assessed the potential of urban and peri-urban agricultural areas in providing some key ES: food supply, CO2 storage and biodiversity / connectivity. We also analysed the planning tools operating in the area to foster the enhancement of the UPUA area within the planning processes. The study was conducted using the scenario method by comparing the current situation with an agroecological scenario and verifying the change in the delivery of these three ES. The results show an increase of CO2 storage capacity and ecological connectivity with tolerable repercussions on food provision. Indeed, results highlights the potential of the UPUA in satisfying the food needs of almost 87.9% of the inhabitants of Prato for cereals and 27.9% for legumes whereas, in the agroecological scenario, these produce decrease by about 23% and 11%. Finally, the study suggests the need to integrate governance and territorial planning tools to promote and enhance the role of ES provided by UPUAs on an urban and peri-urban scale.

Employment relations scholarship and trade unions are readily disposed to regard company claims regarding CSR as strategic market response. Prospects for widening the scope of debate come into view through further engagement with a moral turn in socio-economic scholarship and greater public salience of demand for sustainable development. This article investigates the moral dimension and its invocation by labour and management actors. It contends that moral ideations and motivations are under-recognized yet play an inherent part in employment relations. It draws particular attention to the moral dimension of transnational actors' interests and efforts in the negotiation, enactment and sustaining of Global Framework Agreements.

The authors draw on recent developments in institutional theory regarding the development of opaque institutional fields that cause the decoupling between practices and outcomes to develop a new explanation for the lack of sustainable improvement in labor practices in supply chains. Using qualitative and quantitative data from a global apparel supplier and a global home products retailer, they demonstrate the various ways in which opacity causes decoupling between private regulation practices of global firms and outcomes for workers in supply chains.

The nexus between financial autonomy, service provision, stakeholder participation and the resultant allocation of water within the river basin is explored by scrutinising the newly instituted system of water permits and payments. Three cases are examined: (1) parastatal agencies managing large perimeters of irrigated land; (2) large-scale commercial companies irrigating land; and (3) so-called focal points representing groups of smallholder irrigators. The three presented cases show that structural challenges, local geographies and power relations shape the final outcome of water reforms in relation to decentralised river basin management, stakeholders' participation and accountability. Rather than improving accountability to users and securing the financial basis for sustainable infrastructure operation and maintenance, the permit system in place reinforces existing inequalities.

These contests highlight the centrality (or not) of participation in CBT, and even its developmental failure. We attempt to move the conversation away from whether and how much participation exists to focus on emic interpretations of how CBT is experienced. As such, our focus is on how and why communities participate in CBTs, as informed by practice theory. We examine how participation might be understood and explained across three cases from Kenya, namely Il Ngwesi, Lumo Wildlife Sanctuary and Mwaluganje Elephant Sanctuary. The data were obtained through in-depth interviews, participant observation and documented sources. The findings highlighted that CBT was a response to contextual challenges, led by the community elders. Community participation was often through representation, which is interpreted in relation to local practices. Case narratives and thematic analysis demonstrated that community participation appeared across the cases as a recurrent practice, or motif, its different forms influenced by local sociocultural, economic and sometimes political tensions in each case environment. Understanding how community participation takes place in different settings informs possibilities for realizing and enhancing tourism-led community development strategies, freeing participation from apparent Western standards.

J	Zhang, TH				Zhang, Tianhai			Using Satellite Imagery to Determine Spatiotemporal Patterns of Built-Up Land Use in Relation to the Coastline: An Example from Xiamen, China	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH			English	Article; Early Access						Urbanization; built-up land; coastline; spatiotemporal pattern; Xiamen	DRIVING FORCES; CITY CONSTRUCTION; URBAN-GROWTH; CITIES; URBANIZATION; EVOLUTION; POLICY; MODEL	This study used four Landsat-TM satellite imageries (1989, 2000, 2010, and 2018) to detect the spatiotemporal change characteristics of built-up land by using variance and correlation analysis to ensure the ecological capacity and urban sustainable development in Xiamen. The results show that during the rapid urbanization period of 1989 to 2018, a large amount of farmland (70.7%) and the water body (64.4%) were lost. Among them, 43.8% of farmland and 33.6% of the water body have been converted to built-up land, producing great pressure on ecological security and sustainable development. On spatial distribution pattern, this research found that the built-up land expansion in Xiamen mainly occurred along the coastline. Preliminary statistics found that the built-up land is mainly concentrated in the coastal zone as far as 5 km (reaches maximum density of 0.37 6 0.16) from the coastline. In this zone, the built-up land is most compact and intensive, whereas most of the new built-up land increased 5 km to 9 km away to the coastline. Variance analysis shows that built-up land density at all distances of buffer lines are very significant differences (P , 0.01), and the difference reaches the maximum of 0.289 at a buffer line of 7 km. Correlation analysis shows that the built-up land density varies significantly and negatively correlated with the distance to the coastline (P , 0.01), indicating that the farther away from the coastline, the smaller the density of built-up land is. The final regression analysis shows that a significant relationship with cubic regression equation occurs between the built-up land area in 1989, the built-up land density in 2018, and the distance from the coastline. Based on this analysis, the possible impact factors of the spatial pattern and approaches to a compact city are discussed.

THE GOVERNANCE OF EFFICIENT HEALTHCARE FINANCING SYSTEM IN OECD COUNTRIES	POLISH JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						healthcare efficiency; health spending; health indicators; OECD	SELF-ASSESSED HEALTH; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; DETERMINANTS; EXPENDITURE; OUTCOMES; QUALITY; MANAGEMENT; MORTALITY; TOURISM; IMPACT	The objective of this study was to assess the relations between health spending and selected indicators of healthcare efficiency in the classification of healthcare financing systems in OECD countries. The study also provides an insight into the amount of health spending and healthcare efficiency, represented by life expectancy at birth, positive health self-assessment, and the health care index. The relationships of the selected variables were primarily examined in per their classification according to the health financing system. Aspects falling under the main objective were analysed through statistical descriptive analysis and analysis of relationships. The relationship between the level of funding in terms of GDP and the outputs of healthcare efficiency was confirmed. However, this connection was not confirmed when considering the healthcare financing system. The national health financing appeared to be the only system where the relationship existed. Simultaneously, the importance of managing an efficient healthcare financing system can be highlighted.

This cultural heritage is often unprotected, forgotten and increasingly neglected. However, thanks to the possibilities offered by new technologies (GIS and ICT), this delicate heritage may be understood and disseminated in such a way that it becomes a sustainable development resource. In the case of Valverde de Burguillos, the creation of an online platform for exchange, information, participation, and decision-making in relation to this cultural heritage will increase awareness, use, and dissemination. A design proposal is presented with guidelines for its implementation by the administration, which, in case of successful application, will also enable management entities-with the collaboration of citizens-to define sustainable rural development strategies supported by governance and citizen collaboration.

Drawing on a case study in Lam Dong province and applying an environmental justice lens, we examine how various social actors assert claims over forests and how these claims invoke different notions of justice, authority and identity. Our analysis highlights that the development and implementation of the project has generated renewed competing claims and conflicts over forests among social actors. Underlying these conflicts there are incompatible notions of justice and associated rights, which lead different actors to accord legitimacy variously to the global norms brought about by REDD+, the customary resource practices of indigenous people, or to the state's laws. We show that the negotiations over forests in REDD+ reflect the influence of the specific historical and political-economic settings in which REDD+ activities take place, including pre-existing conflicts over forests and power relations underpinning forest management. From a policy perspective, our research suggests that any attempts to introduce simplified and uniform regulations for forest governance in REDD+ should be avoided, since local institutions and conceptions of justice will significantly influence what is regarded as legitimate policy and can thus be endorsed as inspiration for sustainable forest governance.Key policy insights REDD+ in Vietnam has spurred contestations over who is legitimately entitled to govern and manage forests.Claims and conflicts over forests can be explained by incompatible and distinct notions of justice, authority and identity.Contestations over justice pose radical challenges to any global and national efforts that attempt to implement simplified rules and ideas for forest based-climate change mitigation.Attention to justice, especially to compatibility and differences in ideas about justice, is crucial for sustainable forest governance.

Yet, there is still poor understanding of how to navigate the tensions that emerge in these processes. Through analyzing 32 initiatives worldwide that co-produced knowledge and action to foster sustainable social-ecological relations, we conceptualize 'co-productive agility' as an emergent feature vital for turning tensions into transformations. Co-productive agility refers to the willingness and ability of diverse actors to iteratively engage in reflexive dialogues to grow shared ideas and actions that would not have been possible from the outset. It relies on embedding knowledge production within processes of change to constantly recognize, reposition, and navigate tensions and opportunities. Co-productive agility opens up multiple pathways to transformation through: (1) elevating marginalized agendas in ways that maintain their integrity and broaden struggles for justice; (2) questioning dominant agendas by engaging with power in ways that challenge assumptions, (3) navigating conflicting agendas to actively transform interlinked paradigms, practices, and structures; (4) exploring diverse agendas to foster learning and mutual respect for a plurality of perspectives. We explore six process considerations that vary by these four pathways and provide a framework to enable agility in sustainability transformations. We argue that research and practice spend too much time closing down debate over different agendas for change - thereby avoiding, suppressing, or polarizing tensions, and call for more efforts to facilitate better interactions among different agendas.

However, it is unlikely that a single crisp number can capture a complex issue, such as the analysis of the sustainability of human progress both at the local and the global scale. This paper tackles this standard epistemological predicament in relation to a media-friendly model of man's impact on Nature: the Ecological Footprint (EF). The claim made by the proponents of this analytical tool is that EF makes it possible to check "how much is taken" by the economic process versus "how much could be taken" according to ecological processes. In this paper we argue that the ecological footprint assessment - purportedly useful as an argument against the idea of perpetual growth - is fraught with internal contradictions. Our critical appraisal is based on the lack of correspondence between the semantics - the claim about what the EF accounting does - and the syntax - the EF protocol of accounting that should deliver the purported output. We critically examine the various assumptions used in the approach, showing that the EF is in contradiction with its stated purposes and would lead to paradoxes if its prescriptions were used for policy making. We also contend that the laboriousness of EF computation protocols contrasts with its ultimate fragility. In fact the estimate of carbon footprint due to energy production is what determines the assessment of the planet's deficit of virtual land. We show that this estimate cannot be defended in light of the assumptions and simplifications used for its construction. Our conclusion is that the EF does not serve a meaningful discussion on the modeling of sustainability, and that the same media-friendly narrative about the Earth Overshot day is in the end reassuring and complacent when considering other aspects on man's pressure on the planet and its ecosystems.

However, there are limited studies that analyse and reflect on the lack of coordination among different actors and report the practical ground-level challenges confronted at a local level, in order to increase the robustness and sustainability of rural water supply. Hence, this research brings together actors at three different levels-community, local government and local administration to capture their holistic understanding of actions and strategies, and the possible hurdles which may hinder their implementation. A narrative approach is adapted to derive the outcome based on real-life experiences of the respondents. Prioritized actions are mainly found to follow supply-side approach with a complete lack of demand-responsive strategies or actions as well as focus on providing services at a point of time and not over a period. Despite institutional reforms and changes in laws and strategies, prioritized actions are found to be more regulated by corruption, political intentions and social power relations in the study area. A lack of sense of ownership among local community restricts their participation in operation and maintenance of water sources. The struggle to provide the maintenance and major repairs required to keep water supply operational sustainably are well evident in the study area. While financial constraints are perceived to be a significant barrier in the implementation of the actions, technical and natural hurdles are also identified that demonstrates the need for integrated, contextual and well-coordinated strategies and actions to ensure rural water security. The study lays the ground for a paradigm shift in rural water supply and management in India-from a focus on increasing coverage to a focus on quality infrastructure, regular operation and maintenance and proactive monitoring approaches which will prevent from poorly targeted future investments and lessen the subsequent burden on communities.

The relationship between the supply and demand of ESs in the basin can reflect the coordination level of the basin's ecology and economy. A clear understanding of the relations between ESs supply and demand is the foundation for sustainable river basin ecosystem management. However, there are differences in the health state of different rivers. Unhealthy rivers may be unable to effectively meet the needs of ecosystem services in their basins, thus threatening the ecological health state and sustainable economic development in the basin. Therefore, in this study, a quantitative analysis framework for the supply and demand of river basin ecosystem services (RBES) based on river health states was developed to achieve the basin's rational utilization and sustainable development. Guangdong Province of China was selected, the supply and demand of four ESs relevant to multi-stakeholders (water retention, soil retention, carbon storage, and water purification) in four representative sub-basins were quantified. The ecological supply-demand ratio (ESDR) was introduced to reflect the surplus or shortage of ESs at different river health states. The results showed that the study area exhibited a spatial mismatch between ESs supply and demand. The ESDR of water retention, soil retention, and water purification services in healthy sub-basins were higher than sub-healthy ones, indicating a certain synergy between the health state of the river and its supply and demand state of ES. Implementing targeted spatial management and control is an important measure to ensure the sustainable development of river basins. This study can provide references for sustainable management of river basins and targeted governance under different river health states within and beyond China.

Yet, an emerging body of work has raised critical questions about how adaptation is being conceived and implemented in the global South. We systematize and contribute to this critical scholarship by distinguishing three fundamental political dimensions of the adaptation problem, related to differential responsibility, the global uneven production of vulnerability, and unequal relations of power in adaptation decision-making itself. Further, based on research from across the global South, the paper suggests that the current program of 'mainstreaming' adaptation into existing development logics and structures perpetuates an anti politics machine, obscuring and depoliticizing rather than addressing the political dimensions of the adaptation problem. Mainstreaming risks not only reproducing development-as-usual, but in fact reinforcing technocratic patterns of control. The three-dimensional view of the politics of climate change adaptation is offered as an analytical perspective to sharpen and systematize future critical adaptation scholarship. In the conclusion, we highlight avenues toward enhanced attention to power and justice in climate change research and practice. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Zamfir, E				Zamfir, Elena			Towards an Integrated Social Policy in Post-December Romania: Between Aspiration and Reality	REVISTA DE CERCETARE SI INTERVENTIE SOCIALA			English	Article						social policy; social problems; social development; capitalist society; poverty; quality of life; vulnerable groups		The study highlights the new trends in public social policies of preventing marginalization risks for vulnerable groups and individuals, concomitantly with shaping social/community responsibility for a programme of sustainable social change and development. On the background of some theories about the interdependency and complexity of human needs, these new policy directions attempt to mitigate major issues regarding the social development and normal community integration requirements for the members of the society. The present analysis focuses on the political and ideological principles required for promoting some integrated public social policies required for increasing quality of life. A synthetic review is made as regards the profile of social policies in Romania after 1990. The analysis of 30 years of transition highlights a distinct profile of social policies in the framework of the "selected models of country". The evaluation of the governmental strategies will pursue the impact of public social policies on some vulnerable categories with high marginalization risk. The analysis attempts to identify actual types of risks in relation with the profile of the beneficiaries and their approach by the governance depending on the political options. A long-term time horizon will be considered along with a short-term one for emphasizing the distinct profiles of the public policies, specific to the post-December governments. During the last years, a new trend of social development emphasizes increasingly more frequently in Europe the need of major objectives for a programme of economic growth in agreement with the social and human requirements. Thus, those stages of "economic development per se" by disregarding "human presence" could be exceeded. Therefore, the new EU direction for sustainable economic development is centered on "socially inclusive economic growth". As such, the new trends within public policies take account also of a wide sphere of non-economic social factors, corresponding proper to the multidimensional profile of the quality of life and human development.

J	Cunningham, A; Anoncho, VF; Sunderland, T				Cunningham, A.; Anoncho, V. F.; Sunderland, T.			Power, policy and the Prunus africana bark trade, 1972-2015	JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Prunus africana; Bark harvest; Forest governance	MEDICINAL-PLANTS; FOREST; MANAGEMENT; CAMEROON; SCIENCE; TRENDS; TIME	Ethnopharmacological relevance: After almost 50 years of international trade in wild harvested medicinal bark from Africa and Madagascar, the example of Prunus africana holds several lessons for both policy and practice in the fields of forestry, conservation and rural development. Due to recent CITES restrictions on P. africana exports from Burundi, Kenya and Madagascar, coupled with the lifting of the 2007 European Union (EU) ban in 2011, Cameroon's share of the global P. africana bark trade has risen from an average of 38% between 1995 and 2004, to 72.6% (658.6 metric tons) in 2012. Cameroon is therefore at the center of this international policy arena. Methods and materials: This paper draws upon several approaches, combining knowledge in working with P. africana over a 30 -year period with a thorough literature review and updated trade data with "ground-truthing" in the field in 2013 and 2014. This enabled the construction of a good perspective on trade volumes (1991-2012), bark prices (and value-chain data) and the gaps between research reports and practice. Two approaches provided excellent lenses for a deeper understanding of policy failure and the "knowing-doing gap" in the P. africana case. A similar approach to Medard's (1992) analyses of power, politics and African development was taken and secondly, studies of commodity chains that assess the power relations that coalesce around different commodities (Ribot, 1998; Ribot and Peluso, 2003). Results: Despite the need to conserve genetically and chemically diverse P. africana, wild populations are vulnerable, even in several "protected areas" in Burundi, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo and in the forest reserves of Madagascar. Secondly, hopes of decentralized governance of this forest product are misplaced due to elite capture, market monopolies and subsidized management regimes. At the current European price, for P. africana bark (US$6 per kg) for example, the 2012 bark quota (658.675 t) from Cameroon alone was worth over US$3.9 million, with the majority of this accruing to a single company. In contrast to lucrative bark exports, the livelihood benefits and financial returns to local harvesters from wild harvest are extremely low. For example, in 2012, the 48 active harvesters working within Mount Cameroon National Park (MCNP) received less than 1US$ per day from bark harvests, due to a net bark price of 0.33 US$ per kg (or 43% of the farm gate price for wild harvested bark). In addition, the costs of inventory, monitoring and managing sustainable wild harvests are far greater than the benefits to harvesters. Conclusion: Without the current substantial international donor subsidies, sustainable harvest cannot be sustained. What is required to supply the current and future market is to develop separate, traceable P. africana bark supply chains based on cultivated stocks. On-farm production would benefit thousands of small-scale farmers cultivating P. africana, including local women, for whom wild harvesting is too onerous.

Leveraging Post-Disaster Windows of Opportunities for Change towards Sustainability: A Framework	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						change agents; development; disaster recovery; opportunity; sustainability transitions	DISASTER RECOVERY; TRANSITION MANAGEMENT; ADAPTIVE GOVERNANCE; SOCIAL-CHANGE; NEW-YORK; RECONSTRUCTION; RESILIENCE; CRISIS; LESSONS; ADAPTATION	Disasters are catalysts for change: they are increasingly recognized as offering opportunities to direct and navigate change towards aspired outcomes, such as sustainable development goals. However, we know little about how to leverage the opportunities created by disasters to achieve sustainability objectives. Learning from existing case studies is challenging, partly because there is no framework that integrates concepts of change from both sustainability science and disaster recovery literatures. This study develops a unified analytical framework to facilitate the documentation and analysis of case studies of sustainability transitions following disasters. Our aim is to enhance the potential for theory-building, and to draw lessons that can be used to help leverage opportunities presented by disasters in the future. We apply the framework to available empirical cases and identify specific conditions, resources, social relations and constraints that affect disaster-to-sustainability transitions. Our expectation is that this framework will serve professionals and researchers in the fields of sustainable development and disaster mitigation to enhance the effectiveness of their research and applied activities.

The role of institutional actors and their interactions in the land use policy making process in Ethiopia	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Administrative levels; Awareness; Land governance; Land use planning; Land use policy; Natural resource management	CENTRAL RIFT-VALLEY; POPULATION-DENSITY; MANAGEMENT; GOVERNANCE; INTENSIFICATION; SUSTAINABILITY; PARTICIPATION; DYNAMICS; IMPACT; MARKET	This study investigates the role of the different institutional actors involved in the development and implementation of land use policies in the Ethiopian Rift Valley. The work is based on interviews with key informants from different administrative levels and these results are compared to the relevant policy documents. While the constitution prescribes a participatory policy development process, our results show that in reality policies are made at the highest level and implemented in a top-down approach from the higher to the lower administrative levels. Moreover, the institutional network mainly consists of institutions that are hierarchically linked, while horizontal and diagonal relations are less common and less important. Consistently, higher level institutions are mostly involved in the development of land use policies, while the roles of lower level institutions are predominantly in the implementation thereof. This lack of participation by lower level institutions, in addition to a lack of capacity and absence of clear institutional mandates, hampers the effectiveness of land use policies. Our results also provide suggestions to improve the development, communication, and eventually the acceptability of land use policies towards sustainable land management.

J	Arendt, R; Muhl, M; Bach, V; Finkbeiner, M				Arendt, Rosalie; Muhl, Marco; Bach, Vanessa; Finkbeiner, Matthias			Criticality assessment of abiotic resource use for Europe- application of the SCARCE method	RESOURCES POLICY			English	Article						Resource use; Criticality; Sustainable development; Supply risk; ESSENZ; SCARCE	GOVERNANCE	Due to current consumption patterns and increasing product complexity, the use of abiotic resources has been rising and has led to supply risk (criticality) challenges in many countries and regions including Europe. The SCARCE method, originally developed to assess criticality in Germany, includes several criticality determinants that are missing from the existing European method by Pennington et al. (2017). Specifically it i) considers additional supply risk and vulnerability categories like price fluctuations, long term availability and importance in future technologies ii) takes a sustainability perspective by including environmental and social aspects of resource use iii) enables the comparison of the European supply risk with the global supply risk. Therefore, we have applied the SCARCE method to perform a criticality assessment of European resource use considering eleven supply risk categories (e.g. trade barriers and political stability) and six vulnerability categories (e.g. economic importance and substitutability) for 42 materials (including metals, metalloids and fossil fuels). In our assessment, the most critical materials for Europe are petroleum oils, gallium, rare earths and phosphorus, because of their high supply risk impacts due to high primary material use, high trade barriers and low political stability in mining countries as well as vulnerability impacts (due to their high economic importance, high utilization in future technologies and low substitutability). The three materials with the worst social performance (considering small scale mining, human rights abuse and geopolitical risk) are tantalum, cobalt and tin (e.g. because of high production share in small scale mining for tin), while the materials with the worst environmental performance (considering greenhouse gas emissions, water scarcity and sensitivity of the local biodiversity) are gold, platinum and niobium (e.g. because of a high amount of associated greenhouse gas emissions for gold). Our findings show that the European supply risk does not differ significantly from the global supply risk, but some assessment categories show different tendencies. Compared to the global production, the mining capacity of the countries that are exporting to Europe is lower, because the European import mix is often dominated by one country only while the global production is more diverse. Further, countries that are currently exporting to Europe have higher political stability than the countries that dominate the global production, which indicates that Europe might have to develop new trade relations with politically unstable countries to meet its domestic material demand. Overall, our assessment results are in line with the finding of the previously conducted study on critical raw materials by the European Union, but provide some additional insights by considering social and environmental impacts.

We apply this to the inhabitants of Batu Katak, Sumatra, Indonesia, where the Green Life Project has been established next to Gunung Leuser National Park as a Private Protected Area. An important governance strategy for Green Life is the establishment of volunteer ecotourism to generate funds and to include the local community. We argue that ecotourism can play a crucial role in legitimising the activities and increasing the power of nature conservation organisations, which, in the case of Green Life, is visible in the growth of coercive means to secure protected areas. If ecotourism is the kernel of neoliberal environmentality at Green Life, the core issue is the prevalence of truth environmentality, in which nature is often valued higher than people. This valuation led to the strengthening of disciplinary and sovereign environmentality. Arguably, ecotourism at Green Life will not establish the intended sustainable relations with the community, and this paper functions as an important lesson for practitioners to scrutinise the consequences of their governance strategies.

Improving knowledge exchange among scientists and decisionmakers to facilitate the adaptive governance of marine resources: A review of knowledge and research needs	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Review						Knowledge exchange; Knowledge transfer; Decision-making; Institutional barriers; Institutional innovation; Enabling environment; Research needs	SOCIAL-SCIENCE; CORAL-REEF; ENVIRONMENTAL-MANAGEMENT; SUPPORT CONSERVATION; LOCAL KNOWLEDGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; POLICY; STAKEHOLDER; SYSTEMS; ORGANIZATIONS	The science-based management of natural resources requires knowledge exchange between scientists and environmental decision-makers, however, this exchange remains a significant challenge. Rather, evidence suggests that decision-makers rely on individual experience or other secondary sources of knowledge in isolation from scientific evidence when formulating decisions, potentially compromising the effectiveness of their decisions. As a result a new field of research broadly characterised as 'knowledge exchange' has emerged, focused largely on identifying and overcoming the barriers to knowledge exchange among scientists and decision-makers. More recently knowledge exchange research has also begun to explore the relationship between science and decision-making specifically in relation to marine ecosystems and resources. The aim of this paper is to review the literature in relation to knowledge exchange for natural resource management, with a focus on recent evidence in relation to the management of marine resources. This review identifies critical barriers inhibiting knowledge exchange among marine scientists and decisions-makers, such as the inaccessibility of science to decision-makers as well as institutional barriers that limit the extent to which scientists and decision-makers can prioritise knowledge exchange activities. Options for overcoming these barriers, such as novel approaches to knowledge exchange (e.g. knowledge co-production, knowledge brokers and boundary organisations) and the enabling environments and institutional reforms needed to complement efforts to improve knowledge exchange, are also identified. This review concludes by articulating the gaps in our understanding of knowledge exchange, to help guide future research in this field and improve the sustainable management of marine resources.

Scaling-up energy conservation initiatives: Barriers and local strategies	SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Scaling-up; Energy conservation initiatives; Barriers; Local strategies; Low-carbon	RENEWABLE ENERGY; EFFICIENCY MEASURES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; URBAN ENERGY; POLICY; CITIES; GOVERNANCE; BUILDINGS; DRIVERS; CARBON	Energy conservation in residential and commercial buildings is considered a key challenge and opportunity for low-carbon urban development. In cities worldwide, energy conservation initiatives have been realized that demonstrate the social, financial, and environmental benefits that energy conservation can generate. However, in order to accomplish international goals pertaining to climate mitigation, these initiatives need to go to scale and reach a greater and broader audience. To accelerate the scaling-up of such initiatives, an in-depth understanding of barriers hampering this process and local strategies that can be applied to address these barriers is required. While scholars and practitioners underline the importance of local solutions to the global problem of climate change, little is known about strategies that can be applied at the local level to overcome barriers. This paper has three general findings that can make a valuable contribution to theory and practice on urban climate governance. First, it sketches the context-specificity of barriers to scaling-up energy conservation initiatives and reflects on similarities and differences in barriers to energy conservation in residential and commercial building stocks in two European cities: Utrecht and Valencia. Second, this paper presents several local strategies that can be applied to overcome barriers, thereby improving our understanding of the relation between barriers and solutions. Finally, the findings of the paper suggest that while many barriers have national or international origins, the local environment appears to be a promising scale to address barriers.

The project "People for Ecosystem Based Governance in Assessing Sustainable Development of Ocean and Coast"-PEGASO within the work was conducted is financed by the Seventh Framework Programme. The PEGASO project has been designed to identify common threats and solutions in relation to the long-term sustainable development and environmental protection of coastal zones bordering the Mediterranean and Black Seas in ways relevant to the implementation of the Integrated Coastal Zone Management Protocol (ICZM). The solutions schema for the case study was planned with the help of the Consideo software which is able to design the relations between the different costal environment component, different threats and different human activities in coastal areas. These solutions are as result of the stakeholder involvement. Ranking and combining solutions in Cross-Impact Balance (CIB) software program determines the most consistent scenarios in order to preserve the Natural Capital and to have a human society development revering the ICZM Protocol. Later on these scenarios or part of them could be transformed into local policies which will serve the spatial planning process. After choosing the consistent scenarios and elaborating local policies that should be implemented in the area, spatial planning represents the final theoretical step for implementing local (but there could be also other levels) policies that are guided by the ICZM Protocol.

Yet in spite of their economic potential, extractive industry projects come with considerable social and environmental risks for northern indigenous communities. Within these communities, the associated challenges of resource development are felt most acutely by women; however, there is a lack of research and analysis concerning the gendered dimension of resource development in northern Canada through the lens of indigenous women's human rights. This article proposes the adoption of a rights-based approach to address this issue, suggesting that such an approach can provide a coherent framework for enhancing the inclusion and well-being of indigenous women in resource development, helping to ensure that Canada meets its human rights and constitutional obligations while furthering its commitment to reconciliation with indigenous peoples.

This system is designed for a purpose of making people consider ongoing environmental issues visually and encouraging individuals and organizations to contemplate and take actions for remediation of the problems. This system enables people to create opportunities to deepen and expand individuals' comprehensive knowledge on environmental issues surrounding endangered species, to promote Corporate Social Responsibilities (CSR) activities, and to observe significant hidden connections such as butterfly effect. The system also aims to support "evidence-based policy making" for the local government. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of our system by applying to the analysis of ecological effects of human activities to gorilla's life.

J	van der Vleuten, A; van Eerdewijk, A				van der Vleuten, Anna; van Eerdewijk, Anouka			The Fragmented Inclusion of Gender Equality in AU-EU Relations in Times of Crises	POLITICAL STUDIES REVIEW			English	Article						African Union; crisis; European Union; gender equality; interregionalism; gender mainstreaming	GOVERNANCE; AFRICA	Facing internal and external crises, the European Union and the African Union have revitalized their interregional cooperation. This article theorizes interregional norm dynamics and explores how, in times of crises, gender equality norms are shaped in interregional relations between the African Union and the European Union. The question is all the more relevant because gender equality is shaped very differently in the European Union and the African Union policies. The African Union has adopted a rather holistic understanding of gender equality, while the European Union approach is constrained by a market-making logic. Also, since the 2008 economic crisis, gender equality policies within the European Union seem to stagnate while they seem to expand in the African Union. Our analysis of core texts shows that at interregional level attention to gender equality is fragmented. Even though in some respects the African Union gender equality norms are more encompassing, and gendered effects of crises in the European Union would merit renewed attention to gender equality, the European Union norms and interests dominate the agenda. Showing how power asymmetries between and disjointed logics of regional organizations impact interregional gender equality norms, the article contributes to the scarce literature on interregional norm dynamics.

Seafood is a highly traded and sought after commodity on international markets, and is critically dependent on healthy marine ecosystems. A global trend of wild stocks being overfished and in decline, as well as multiple sustainability challenges associated with a rapid growth of aquaculture, represent key concerns in relation to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Existing efforts aimed to improve the sustainability of seafood production have generated important progress, primarily at the local and national levels, but have yet to effectively address the global challenges associated with the ocean. This study highlights the importance of transnational corporations in enabling transformative change, and thereby contributes to advancing the limited understanding of large-scale private actors within the sustainability science literature. We describe how we engaged with large seafood producers to coproduce a global science-business initiative for ocean stewardship. We suggest that this initiative is improving the prospects for transformative change by providing novel links between science and business, between wild-capture fisheries and aquaculture, and across geographical space. We argue that scientists can play an important role in facilitating change by connecting knowledge to action among global actors, while recognizing risks associated with such engagement. The methods developed through this case study contribute to identifying key competences in sustainability science and hold promises for other sectors as well.

The intricacies associated with the skewed power relations between those who allocate these resources (land, in this case) and those who access and use them vis a vis environmental conservation make the subject a daunting one. Based on preliminary field observations and farmers' opinions on soil health conditions in the Okavango Delta, the paper assesses the nutrient status of selected farmers' fields and how the smallholders and government respond to this peculiar ecological environment. It specifically analyses small farmers' perceptions on the political ecology of soil management in the area. We used a multi-stage sampling procedure to sample 228 smallholder farmers. The smallholders were interviewed using interview schedules. Key informant interviews were used to collect qualitative data from farmers as well. Thirty-three (33) composite soil samples were collected from 30 farmers' plots in three farming communities (Makalamabedi, Nokaneng and Mohembo). Laboratory analysis shows that most soils in the wetland and its dryland surroundings are generally acidic, low in essential nutients as well as in cation-exchange-capacity (CEC). However, the results of a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) conducted shows significant differences in soil nutrient levels in different locations within the Delta. While farming remains an important livelihood of rural communities, policies on natural resource governance particularly along the river channels delimit local farmers' ability to engage in meaningful soil fertility management. The low CEC of the soils is an indication that holistic cultural practices, which are beyond mere chemical fertilizations are critical and more desirable for improved soil health and sustainable rural livelihoods in the Delta.

The question then arises how firms, especially small- to medium-sized firms, become motivated (or react) to address different levels of legislation to go green in China. It is a question which is suggestive of an excellent research opportunity that may enrich the literature on this respect of green motivation. Given the lack of in-depth research on firms' perception and motivation and actions of going green in Chinese hotel industry, a case study of a purposively selected small private-owned hotel was chosen built on an in-depth literature study. The conceptual framework used in this paper was developed from a theoretical interpretation of green motivation, stakeholders and marketing practices to explore Chinese firms' green governance and greening activities (Song-Turner 2010). The advantage of this framework is that it provides a holistic means of examining firms' internal green changes and associated marketing practices. It moves beyond what and why question to examine the how factors within an integrated framework with strategic implications for firms' greening. This paper focuses on how components of the implementing green initiatives with the purpose of understanding the key influential stakeholders and motivations of a SME hotel going green and how it implement and approach green marketing in China. While findings from this case are consistent with a number of other studies on firms' motivation for engaging in green, the case has also revealed some unique firm behaviours and practices in a booming, sustainable building-driven Chinese market. Several implications are considered in relation to environmental management practices.

Neoliberal peri-urban economies and the predicament of dairy farmers: a case study of the Illawarra region, New South Wales	AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES			English	Article; Early Access						Animal welfare; Farmland loss; Multifunctional rural space; Peri-urban agriculture; Residential development; Rural amenity development	AGRICULTURAL CHANGE; URBAN AGRICULTURE; AUSTRALIA; FOOD; DEREGULATION; ATTITUDES; SYDNEY; PRODUCTIVISM; STEWARDSHIP; TRANSITION	Rural Australia has been experiencing dramatic agricultural restructuring. A major contributor to this in some areas is peri-urban and rural residential developments, and amenity/lifestyle developments, including those associated with the inflow of urban middle-class groups into rural areas. These processes are intertwined with neoliberal trends in agri-food governance, and have complex effects on farming. However, there is a lack of farm-level studies that explore how professional farmers have been interacting and co-existing with urban/suburban development while also undertaking agricultural intensification and innovation. This study aims to examine how residential and amenity/lifestyle developments have unfolded in the Illawarra region, New South Wales, and come to influence and interact with local dairy farmers who are also managing the consequences of industry restructuring particularly from 2000. Based on semi-structured interviews, this study shows that with their proximity to Sydney, Illawarra dairy farms are influenced by deregulated planning systems, large-scale residential development, amenity driven demand for rural land, and the amenity/lifestyle economy. These processes bring farmers commercial opportunities and drive farmers to form new social and economic relationships with land buyers and investors. However, it has been increasingly difficult for farmers to acquire land for farming locally. They are also subjected to the expectations and demands of new landholders, including in relation to farm externalities and animal welfare. Farmers have to transform their production systems to fit into this context. The above factors together generate a form of multifunctional rural space.

Many academic and governmental documents reference this; however, there is no existing theoretical or empirical study on the characteristics of smart city services regarding sustainability. In this sense, this study aims to clarify characteristics of Conceptually Related Smart Cities (CRSCs) services from sustainability. The methodologies adopt a matrix taxonomy to sort the previous indicators in the first step. It also utilizes a keyword analysis based on a literature review to identify the characteristics of two concepts. Three outcomes result from the steps of theoretical structures. Firstly, this study develops SSC service indicators based on the synthesis of Sustainable Smart City (SSC) and Smart City and sustainable city. The second outcome is an identification of the relation between SSC services and Conceptually Related Smart Cities. Lastly, the study clarifies the significance of citizen engagement based on the evolutionary concept by typifying service development in the lens of sustainability in CRSCs. This study is worthwhile for understanding smart city services and managing different featured smart cities from a sustainability perspective.

J	Dorre, A				Doerre, Andrei			Promises and realities of community-based pasture management approaches: Observations from Kyrgyzstan	PASTORALISM-RESEARCH POLICY AND PRACTICE			English	Article						Natural resource management; Decentralization; Community-based development; Pastoral production; systems; Post-socialist countries; Central Asia; High mountain regions	NATURAL-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; INSTITUTIONS; CONSERVATION; SYSTEMS; FORESTS	The development discourse maintains that community-based approaches are generally equitable, sustainable, and legitimized strategies for the management of natural resources. It remains frequently unnoticed that the policies and legal frameworks designed to regulate such local governance approaches oftentimes are externally initiated and top-down in nature, and frequently not adapted to local demands and capacities. Significant differences between the goals of such interventions and the lived reality and associated unintended effects were often concealed within the debates. A similar indication can be stated for Kyrgyzstan's pasture law, which demands that local communities are fully responsible for the management of pasturelands. The recent innovation in pasture law has not comprehensively resulted in the desired outcomes on the ground. Based upon a comparison of Kyrgyzstan's pasture-related legislation with the impacts of its implementation in the walnut-fruit forest region located in the south-west of the country, this article points out that community-based pasture management in local practice appears to have resulted in hybrid institutional arrangements comprising aspects of the existing formal legislation and local-specific informal regulations. Simultaneously, case-specific circumstances, particularly the constellation of uneven power holders and interest-driven players and their interactions, as well as the respective socio-economic conditions, highly influence the resource management performances on the ground. The actual outcomes do not necessarily correspond to the requirements of the formal legislation. They can even contradict the requirements of the formal legislation and generate subsequent problems. At a first glance, due to the assumed high participation of the immediate users and the belief in their supposedly intrinsic interest in eco-friendly resource use, community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) approaches seem to have a great potential for creating economic, social, and ecologically sustainable development at the local level. However, the risk of failure is high if the whole approach rests on an apolitical understanding of communities as being homogenous and tensionless groups of social organization and on an idealized image of their ecological awareness. A consistent development strategy that goes beyond the mere definition of unspecific goals has to take the community-specific power relations and the respective socio-economic conditions into consideration. It is also necessary to consider the local needs and costs for CBNRM and the opportunities for its implementation, in order to ensure the adequate representation and participation of all interested resource users within the management bodies and the decision-making processes. If requested, appropriate support should also be provided to communities in need, to assist the transition to the envisaged new regime. Taking these aspects into consideration, Kyrgyzstan's approach for a community-based pasture management could become a more successful and broadly accepted instrument to empower the people at the local level and to enable comprehensively sustainable resource management practices on the ground.

Evidence from Nigeria	GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY-AGRICULTURE POLICY ECONOMICS AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Review						Hunger; SDG 2; Poverty; Food security; Conflict events; Global hunger index		Sustainable Development Goal 2 is hinged on achieving zero hunger, worldwide, by the year 2030. Many developing countries, especially African countries, are faced with extreme hunger often caused or compounded by bad governance, conflicts and climate change. In this paper, we review patterns of Global Hunger Index scores across Africa from 2000 to 2018 noting advances and setbacks in the fight against hunger in relation to the underlying causes of hunger in these nations, using Nigeria, the poverty capital of the world, as a case study. We also review selected policies of the Nigerian government and development partners aimed at reducing hunger in Nigeria and proffer solutions that can help actualise the target of zero hunger by 2030.

Our participatory design research approach addressed the limits of current planning frameworks, exogenous development models, and a complex governance system by integrating the relationship to the territory and the impacts of climate change in the exploration of scenarios for alternative futures adapted to local urban realities. The research illustrates these limits and complexities with hypothetical transformation scenarios in Inukjuak and Salluit. By identifying plausible futures, we formulated sustainable planning strategies combining interrelated factors in the development of project-based interventions to incorporate traditional practices in an urbanizing context. The case of Inukjuak illustrates the importance of natural environments, urban consolidation practices, diversity of use, and socialization, while that of Salluit demonstrates the reciprocity between geomorphological, constructive, socio-cultural, and logistical design variables. Evolving Northern development challenges require that the relevance of these scenarios be examined based on alternative hypotheses and long-term horizons, in the imagination of shared strategies for sustainable planning. Design research, the use of decision-making tools and participatory frameworks are questioned in relation to their contribution to the self-determination of local communities in the "resituation" of their living environments.

A tale of four towns	FUTURES			English	Article							COMPACT CITY; CITIES; INDICATORS; EXPERT; SENSE	The academic debate on sustainable city is like a large arena, where heterogeneous approaches and contributions, coming from different disciplines, flow into without converging on a common vision. The growing awareness that an increasing percentage of the world's population now lives in urban areas makes the organization of this space a crucial issue for global sustainable development. In order to acquire this challenge, urban studies need to overcome conceptual oppositions, seeking new integrated responses to implement the principle of sustainability at urban scale. This effort requires a new managerial approach of science and policy, which can be based on a transdisciplinary vision to knowledge production. The paper is divided into four different sections. The first and second sections review the theoretical literature on urban sustainability and explore the conceptual relations between knowledge and knowledge production in urban governance processes. The third section presents a comparative empirical analysis based on a survey of 2213 questionnaires carried out in four different urban contexts. The fourth and last section outlines the conclusion, suggesting a new approach to manage knowledge in urban governance, in a trans-disciplinary perspective. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Chatterjee, SA; Bernzen, A				Chatterjee, Shantonu Abe; Bernzen, Amelie			What drives the creation of nested markets? A qualitative case study of food markets in West Bengal, India	ERDE			English	Article						nested markets; common-pool resources; sustainable agriculture; India; West Bengal	RURAL-DEVELOPMENT; CONSTRUCTION; FARMERS	The ethics of ecological production, egalitarianism, and democratic control underpinning recent research directions in agri-environmental governance are common to many of the issues explored in the alternative economies literature. One way in which these ethics are put into practice in agri-environmental governance is through the concept of nested markets. Using qualitative methods of interviews and a focus group discussion, we examine newly constructed markets for food at different spatial scales in West Bengal, India. We find that multifunctional farmers and other actors along the supply chain started to construct and/or strengthen their own outlets and channels to reach consumers and to sell their products. Some of these markets build on long, historically deeply-rooted experiences, such as local periodic markets; others are relatively new constructions, making use of internet marketing platforms or messaging services and direct home delivery. Although they are market segments that are nested in the wider commodity markets for food, they have a different nature, different dynamics, a different redistribution of value added, and different relations between producers and consumers. Surprisingly, environmental issues were considered to be less important motivations than the creation of solidarity between producers and consumers. A deeper examination of these markets suggests new possible answers to the question of how to improve the sustainability of agricultural systems within an alternative economies framework.

Improving network approaches to the study of complex social-ecological interdependencies	NATURE SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article							PLANT; SUSTAINABILITY; GOVERNANCE; MANAGEMENT	Achieving effective, sustainable environmental governance requires a better understanding of the causes and consequences of the complex patterns of interdependencies connecting people and ecosystems within and across scales. Network approaches for conceptualizing and analysing these interdependencies offer one promising solution. Here, we present two advances we argue are needed to further this area of research: (i) a typology of causal assumptions explicating the causal aims of any given network-centric study of social-ecological interdependencies; (ii) unifying research design considerations that facilitate conceptualizing exactly what is interdependent, through what types of relationships and in relation to what kinds of environmental problems. The latter builds on the appreciation that many environmental problems draw from a set of core challenges that re-occur across contexts. We demonstrate how these advances combine into a comparative heuristic that facilitates leveraging case-specific findings of social-ecological interdependencies to generalizable, yet context-sensitive, theories based on explicit assumptions of causal relationships.

In this paper, we analyze the different positions taken in relation to the transnational agri-food system by the state sector, the private sector and civil society actors and we map key differences and similarities in the discourses of these groups at the influential 2012 Rio+ 20 Conference. Using neo-Gramscian discourse theory, we uncover the different politico-economic interests that exist and show how these different actors deal with the agri-food system. We demonstrate that international NGOs and grassroots social movements are very diverse in how they approach the question of food security, which in turn is reflected in how they vary in their approach to doing politics. This analysis contributes to our understanding of how hegemony is organized, highlighting the important role of different civil society actors in either maintaining or resisting hegemonic approaches to the transnational agri-food system.

Although there are demands to incorporate socioeconomic impact (SEI) assessment into regulatory deliberations, these often neglect to look beyond the technology in isolation to also include the networks of relations agricultural biotechnologies require and create. This paper argues that understanding the impacts of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) cultivation requires attentiveness to the operational context of the technology as well as a wide range of actors and potential pathways of harm. In order to do this and contribute new empirical research, this paper adopts a system-based perspective and focuses on socioeconomic impacts for a particular actor that is both critically important and highly vulnerable for sustainable agri-food systems: beekeepers. The paper explores the European Court of Justice ruling on the contamination of beehive products with GMOs. It then describes consequent legislative developments and the socioeconomic impacts observed in the wake of this in both Spain and Uruguay. The paper documents the distributive injustice being experienced by beekeepers and highlights the significance of assessing socioeconomic considerations from a systems-based understanding of agriculture and biotechnologies.

Smart grids, information flows and emerging domestic energy practices	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Smart grids and smart meters; Households; Social practices	CONSUMPTION; POLICY; POLITICS	Smart energy grids and smart meters are commonly expected to promote more sustainable ways of living. This paper presents a conceptual framework for analysing the different ways in which smart grid developments shape - and are shaped by - the everyday lives of residents. Drawing upon theories of social practices and the concept of informational governance, the framework discerns three categories of 'information flows': flows between household-members, flows between households and energy service providers, and flows between local and distant households. Based on interviews with Dutch stakeholders and observations at workshops we examine, for all three information flows, the changes in domestic energy practices and the social relations they help to create. The analysis reveals that new information flows may not produce more sustainable practices in linear and predictable ways. Instead, changes are contextual and emergent. Second, new possibilities for information sharing between households open up a terrain for new practices. Third, information flows affect social relationships in ways as illustrated by the debates on consumer privacy in the Netherlands.

Despite similarities, the concepts stem from different disciplines and policy arenas and reflect various models of people-nature relations. This paper aims to analyze the uptake of greening concepts in scientific planning literature focusing on (urban) nature and landscape in the metropolitan region of Stockholm, Sweden, over the last three decades. It investigates what changes this evolution has brought in terms of the topics adopted, methods applied, and types of planning support put into practice. We identified 574 articles that reflect substantial research on greening concepts in the Swedish planning context. The articles demonstrate an initial prevalence of biodiversity with later increases of interest in ecosystem services and NBS. A detailed analysis of the studies focusing on Stockholm revealed Population growth/densification, Green space management and Biodiversity conservation as the most commonly addressed societal challenges. The most frequently mentioned type of green and blue element is Parks and (semi)natural urban green areas, including urban forests. Methods applied were mostly quantitative, while mixes with qualitative approaches were only apparent in ecosystem services articles. Half of the studies involved practitioners or decision-makers, but only four seemed related to real-life planning processes. Taken together, the influence of scientific literature on the uptake of greening concepts in spatial planning seems to have been limited. Future mainstreaming of greening concepts in Stockholm and beyond could benefit from available data, methods and experiences, but will require more active translation and boundary management. Further research into science-policy-planning interfaces at city scale is thus imperative to advance more sustainable pathways for people and nature in metropolitan regions.

This paper presents the further development of the general framework, which was devoted to the assessment of the perspectives that can be taken when approaching the issue of land targets. The framework offered the structure for the discussion and evaluation of various concrete options for targets in the area of land. This paper described some of the most influential concepts of resource targets regarding land use in relation to Rockstrom et al.'s suggestion of planetary boundaries. It gives answers to the aforementioned questions. We suggested an approach towards setting land resource targets.

New types of rural-urban interaction, recovering the value of a territorial vision, can put in value, in original forms, creative, innovative potential of new relations between urban and rural areas. In this framework, the Italian national strategy named "Strategia Nazionale Aree Interne" (SNAI) represents an existing and emerging governance approach looking at official authorities but also at informal governance groups to overcome the classic opposition between rural and urban. The Sicilian case study of Terre Sicane, in particular, can be considered a starting point to work on the idea that "rural" is a critical element to understand the contemporary and new sustainable life styles as possibility of change.

Understanding Poverty in Cash-crop Agro-forestry Systems: Evidence from Ghana and Ethiopia	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						Poverty; Agriculture; Ghana; Ethiopia; Cocoa; Coffee	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; SUSTAINABLE INTENSIFICATION; ECOLOGICAL INTENSIFICATION; TRADE-OFFS; AGRICULTURE; SYNERGIES; DYNAMICS; FUTURE; TRAPS; LAND	This paper examines the linkages between cash-crop income and other dimensions of poverty to interrogate assumptions regarding the relationship between agricultural income and poverty alleviation. The analysis treats poverty as a multi-dimensional and socially disaggregated phenomenon. The paper employs a mixed methods approach to case studies of Ghana and Ethiopia to explore two critical issues. First, how income from cash crops is linked with other dimensions of poverty. Second, how income and land are socially disaggregated. The paper then draws on qualitative data to critically reflect on how poverty is understood within studied communities. The results show that some, but not all, indicators of poverty vary across income quartiles and that significant differences exist across social groups. The analysis suggests that although cash crops are essential, focusing on increasing income from cash crops will not necessarily have a predictable or progressive impact on wellbeing. Furthermore, the analysis highlights how contextual factors, such as the provision of communal services, the nature of land holdings and the quality of local governance mediate the potential poverty alleviating outcomes of income increases. Future development of sustainable intensification strategies should focus on the prevalence of trade-offs and the fundamental social relations underpinning poverty dynamics.

Stakeholder's multidimensional perceptions on policy implementation gaps regarding the current status of Chilean small-scale seaweed aquaculture	MARINE POLICY			English	Article						Subsidy; Commercial seaweeds; Artisanal fishermen; Strategic planning; Sustainability	SWOT ANALYSIS; KELP; SUSTAINABILITY; CULTIVATION; WEAKNESSES; MACROALGAE; LIVELIHOOD; STRATEGIES; MANAGEMENT; STRENGTHS	Seaweed aquaculture is growing worldwide in coastal areas as an alternative to increasing income and food security. Despite these potentials, there is growing concern about the distribution of net benefits and sustainability of local communities. Consequently, governance must be able to include cross-sectoral dimensions related to aquaculture development given these challenging scenarios. Chile, the main seaweed producer of the western world, is implementing a new policy framework for sustainable development of small-scale seaweed aquaculture, principally through the transfer of funds for artisanal fishermen and small-scale farmers. Although supported by the existing demand for raw material and a reliable technological basis for cultivation, lack of added-value products and low-priced biomass may have a critical impact on the livelihood of those involved in aquaculture operations creating uncertainties for sustainable expansion. This study applied a multi-criteria decision analysis (i.e., hybrid SWOT - AHP analysis) to interpret stakeholders' multidimensional perceptions on policy implementation gaps regarding the current status of Chilean small-scale seaweed aquaculture. Both social and institutional dimensions presented diverging opinions among counterparts with relation to economic, technological and environmental topics. This operating inconsistency will require significant attention on complementary objectives beyond funding, such as innovation, enhancement of commercial channels, the creation of internal markets, mainstreaming, education and social equity. Comprehensive and efficient governance able to promote participatory management may improve its own capabilities to overcome an increasingly unfavourable scenario for small-scale seaweed aquaculture.

Questionnaires and non-experimental, in-depth interviews were used for both quantitative and qualitative research, respectively. The main objective of this study is to explore stakeholder attitudes and satisfaction with the creation of corporate images by Thailand's National Housing Authority (NHA). The investigation of NHA stakeholders' attitudes and comments toward the building of this government entity's corporate image strategy led to sustainable developments within the NHA by determining concepts and research methods, crafting a research plan, and identifying the characteristics of the target group. This study includes other sections related to measuring the attitude index, data collection and analysis, comparisons and interpretations of the target group and stakeholder perspectives. The target population is comprised of: Residents in 68 communities under the governance of NHA and Thai citizens, executive directors of the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security (MSDHS), board committee, executive directors, and general staff, companies, the private sector, entrepreneurs, and building contractors, public relations staff. Overall, 30 categories of stakeholders were interviewed. Secondary information, such as project documents, was collected and utilized for action planning, which reflects stakeholder opinions towards the NHA. The survey sample size of stakeholders was limited to 400 people from 12 districts, comprising 31,844 households under the 68 NHA projects in Bangkok.

Therefore, programmes, plans and projects should be started to make cities more sustainable and economically competitive and to increase their quality of life as well as their attractiveness for investments and brilliant people able to lead innovation processes. In particular, the complex relationship between sustainability and urban quality is a strong attractor for those who want to invest in the cities by further rising their economic level and quality of life.

This is an important current-day priority, given the ambitions set out in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and SDG 17 in particular. Increasingly, NPOs have taken up a role as conveners of such CSPs. Research on CSPs has, to date, often considered conveners as a `resource' to the CSP, contributing to its effectiveness. In this study, we shift the focus towards the convener by considering a case of a `mission-driven convener', an NPO that initiates CSPs as a strategy to realize its own sustainability objectives. Our explorative case study-comparing the NPO's efforts across six countries in setting up national coffee platforms-reviews the concept of a mission-driven convener vis-a-vis established notions on convening and identifies which strategies it applies to realize a CSP. These strategies comprise productively combining certification-driven efforts with CSPs, combining process and outcomes of CSPs, and drawing on cross-level dynamics derived from outsourcing of convening work to local actors. With our study, we contribute to research on CSP conveners by offering an alternative interpretation to the relation between the CSP and the convener, attributing more agency to the convener as a mission-driven organization. Strengthening our understanding of CSPs and conveners is an important means to advance the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Community engagement is critical to getting BGI implementation 'right' and producing more sustainable solutions, yet understandings of approaches differ and remain difficult to harmonize or resolve. A review of the extant literature shows that many guidelines frame communities in the passive 'recipient' mode, and remain quiet about the power relations framing and conditioning engagement. The paper then proposes a set of generic template principles for the development of community engagement frameworks to facilitate and encourage greater community co-production of BGI, with the hope that this could then improve public preferences, accountability, efficacy and sustainability.

B	Rao, PK	Rao, PK			Rao, P. K.	Rao, PK		Green Economic Policies: Corporate, Local and National Levels	ARCHITECTURE OF GREEN ECONOMIC POLICIES			English	Article; Book Chapter							MEAT PRODUCTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HEALTH	Roles of producers, consumers, and of governments at local, regional and national levels in improved environmental and socio-economic governance consistent with Green Economic Policies are explored here. Market and regulation methods come into play here, especially in relation to the design and implementation of the emissions trading scheme (ETS). The relevant theories and sonic of the experiences on these aspects are examined. It is argued that the ETS may not deliver results in a cost-effective manner unless several institutional aspects are fully addressed. In terms of policy actions for addressing climate change and sustainable development, it is suggest high priority he accorded to influence consumer choice in food consumption which has implications on resource use intensities and deforestation. Other policies examined here include energy sector choices and corporate case study reports, livestock sector reforms, and related institutional reforms. Two main policy instrument choices for Green Economic Policies (GEP) at national (and to a limited extent at international levels and at regional or sub-regional levels) comprise taxes and cap-and-trade systems (emissions trading scheme, ETS). The role of environmental taxes has been discussed in Chap. 2. This chapter provides a summary view of the role and limitations of ETS. Among top priorities for reduction of greenhouse gases (GHGs) are: energy efficiency improvement and adoption of low-carbon technologies (LCTs), reduction of deforestation and industrial livestock, improved consumer food consumption patterns in relation to the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), and supply chain management. These elements make significant impact on climate change (CC) as well as on the patterns of sustainable development (SD), and are discussed in this chapter.

The integration assumes the certain relations between them. There are researches considering the impact of separate economic indicators on specific smart area or solutions. Nevertheless, the authors have not come across any studies considering the mutual impact of these areas. The goal of the research is to determine the direct effects of smart economy on other smart components and the indirect (mediation) impact of general indicators of national economy on smart domains. The model was estimated using the PLS-SEM technique tested in SmartPLS-3.3.7. software. The sample included statistical data on the indicators, received from Eurostat Database and Latvian Statistical Office. Data referred to Latvia for years 2009-2019. As a result, the hypotheses that Smart Economy has direct impact on smart people, smart living, smart mobility, smart environment, and smart society were supported. The mediation effect of general indicators of national economy was confirmed only for the smart society domain; other hypotheses were rejected. The obtained results can be practically applied by the authorities responsible for sustainable development of smart areas. The results of mediation effect can be especially interesting for countries that do not present a very high level of economic development but are developing smart, sustainable cities.

This paper presents a focus on the vernacular architecture in the oases of the western desert of Egypt as a distinctive traditional architecture. The main aim of this paper is to finding out the principles of "green architecture" through a comparative analysis of both the historical and nowadays desert architecture in the western desert of Egypt. In order to represent a deep relation between traditional green and desert architecture. This paper introduces an energy survey and a comparative analysis of both the historical and recent desert architecture and the analysis of the different traditional housing unit. After that, this paper studies the local ways of construction in the western desert of Egypt. The objective of this paper is established to stimulate environmentally appropriate practices in western desert architectural design and construction through the process of the impact of materials, openings, and construction system to get better recommendation of a recent construction for a green sustainable desert unit in the oases of Egypt. The aim of this paper is to study the comparison between the historical tradition architecture and the contemporary examples of the western desert in the last decade, especially in the main five oases in western desert of Egypt: Siwa Oasis, Bahariya Oasis, Farafra Oasis, Kharga Oasis, and Dakhla Oasis, the comparison will be between three different chosen oases. These studies of western desert architecture are analyzed through different elements such as the materials of the buildings, the pattern, the facades and the construction systems, also the different environmental treatments. Finally, obtaining the best results and recommendations of sustainable and vernacular architecture that helps to get the best energy efficiency construction system of new green residential houses at the oasis of the western desert of Egypt due to the expected expansion of the governance of Egypt in the sustainable and development projects.

J	de Castro, F				de Castro, Fabio			Local politics of floodplain tenure in the Amazon	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS			English	Article						Amazon; floodplain; local management systems; territorial governance	FISHERIES; SCALE	Research on community-based management system has been often grounded on monolithic institutional, social and ecological perspective with focus on the commoners as the only local actor, collective territorial rights as the only local tenure system, and the managed resource unit or ecosystem as the only contested resource driving collective action. However, CBMSs are embedded in local social-ecological systems usually characterized by multiple ruling systems, different local groups, and heterogeneous ecological systems. In this paper I discuss how the floodplain tenure system is negotiated and rearranged between two local groups - community residents and large landholders. This complex and dynamic arrangement comprises three layers of property rights which are combined according to changing ecological and social context. Based on longitudinal empirical data spanning 20 years of research, I describe the history of contemporary human occupation, and the most recent socioeconomic and institutional changes in the region in order to unpack the dynamics of the floodplain tenure in the region. I conclude that assumptions that integration of local management system into a formal legal framework suffices to achieve an efficient co-management system is rather simplistic. Despite major structural changes in the formal tenure framework, power relations between different local users may remain unchanged unless local perceptions and everyday life practices of power relations are changed. Unpacking the multiple ruling systems and everyday life practices that mediate interactions between different local actors is fundamental to understanding how the commons are appropriated at the local level. Therefore, a local contextualization of the social and ecological structure is crucial to reveal potential barriers to the development of an inclusive and sustainable production system.

Scholars in the interdisciplinary studies of engineering, business, and economics have concluded that the socioeconomic parameters of society are deeply linked with organizational efficiency. Organizational efficiency is generally defined as a measure of the relation between the input resources and output generated within a system. Organizational efficiency in public and private sector enterprises plays a crucial role in ensuring value creation and sustaining the economic and social development of countries. The importance of a sustainable economy and social well-being requires many countries around the world to design and implement tailored pathways to achieve their target of sustainable development, which requires assessing and continuously improving the efficiency of their organizations. Measuring efficiency and implementing periodic course corrections are imperative for maintaining high levels of organizational efficiency. The literature on organizational efficiency measurement is limited and qualitatively inferior, especially when it comes to sustainability considerations and for organizations operating in the Arabian Gulf. The research approach developed in this study to measure efficiency in Qatari organizations is crucial in understanding and improving the transformation journey of Qatari, and similar organizations. This paper focuses on the research approach adopted to measure organizational efficiency based on international best practices and conducts a comparative analysis on the local organizations from a sustainability perspective considering all dimensions of economics, environment and social impacts. The methodology involved in measuring and benchmarking organizational sustainability identifies the "as is" state of organizational sustainability and efficiency in the organization. Identifying the causes of the efficiency gap and improving organizational efficiency from the local perspective are the objectives. The survey result ranked the main areas for improvement within local organizations as 23% Overall organization culture and behavior, 21% Human Resources, 19% Leadership and Governance, 18% Operation, 11% Finances and 8% Quality Assurance.

Based on that, recommendations are formulated for policy makers, NGO's, industry and academia how to further develop international bioenergy trade. The chapter is closed by a vision on future bio-based economy, international markets and trade. We show that while bioenergy trade is not a goal on its own, and that substantial challenges for the future development of global and international bioenergy trade may be expected in the coming decades, trade is a crucial prerequisite to balance demand and supply on an international scale and in a sustainable manner which will lead to the development of bioenergy as a carbon-neutral alternative to fossil fuels. At the same time, trade can mobilize rural areas around the world into becoming key energy producers and exporters which in turn can contribute to poverty alleviation and further development and modernization of the agricultural sector. However, such developments will need governance frameworks and best industry examples to ensure sustainable production, trade and use - and this book provides many state-of-the-art insights in what can be learned from current market experiences, certification efforts, logistics and preconditions with respect to policy and investment.

Analysing Consumers' Role and Action in Gruppi di Acquisto Solidale (Solidarity Purchasing Groups)	SOCIOLOGIA RURALIS			English	Article							CONSUMPTION; COMMUNITY; SYSTEM	This article aims at analysing the features and the dynamics of those alternative agri-food networks in which consumers act as initiators. Drawing on a survey of ongoing initiatives at national level and on evidence from empirical fieldwork in a specific territorial context showing a variegated and dynamic reality at this regard (Tuscany), the article analyses consumers' evolving attitudes and behaviour, around and even beyond food, unfolding during their involvement in these initiatives. In particular, it focuses on the experience of the solidarity-based purchasing groups, consumers' organisations promoted by groups of citizens aiming at getting control of the food they consume. Using an actornetwork perspective, the article analyses how purchasing and consumption routines change when consumers join these initiatives. The article also discusss the potential of these initiatives as drivers of change along with the following questions: to what extent do these initiatives challenge dominant food practices and system governance? On what basis are these initiatives sustainable and are replicable in different contexts? How can they foster other forms of civic engagement? In this regard, the article tests a transition management approach, considering solidarity-based purchasing groups as socio-technical niches within broader socio-technical regimes in a macro landscape characterised by the globalisation of the food system. In particular, it analyses the critical points where niches enter in conflict with existing socio-technical regimes, and the way in which these groups act to remove legal, technological and cultural barriers to their development.

This paper sets out to investigate this capacity in the county of Stockholm, Sweden, by surveying 26 municipalities and analysing two case study municipalities through participation in workshops and interviews. The study shows the need both for a local energy and climate policy domain that can be integrated into spatial planning as well as dedicated personnel to maintain this policy, thereby securing knowledge resources within the organisation. Additionally, the importance of relations to and repertoires for interacting with politicians is highlighted. Lastly, the study demonstrates the complementary added value of a regional-local network administered by the County Administrative Board, spreading learning examples and diffusing theoretical knowledge, as well as sub-regional, inter-municipal networks that enable the transfer of more practical knowledge and provide a platform for concrete action.

However, as coastal ecosystem carrying capacity (ESCC) is vital to sustainable coastal ecosystem development and societal and environmental well-being, to engender a more harmonious human-ocean coexistence, this paper developed a comprehensive coastal ESCC evaluation index system based on economic development, resource utilization, and environmental governance, which was then employed to analyze South Korea's coastal ESCC from 2009 to 2019. It was found that South Korea's coastal ESCC slightly improved over the 11-year study period, although there were fluctuations. There was a decrease in coastal ESCC health in 2014 because of the Sewol ferry event and in 2019 because of the Hanjin Shipping bankruptcy and the impact of the 2018 Terminal High Altitude Area Defense deployment. Based on the findings, several policy development suggestions are given.

Conventional, technology oriented means for combating the problem have often showed their limitations. This paper qualitatively examines the phenomenon of theft in two distinct developing contexts. The purpose is to show the merits of applying a grounded, socio-technical and relational analysis for understanding and addressing electricity theft in particular, and for realising sustainable energy systems in general. Material has primarily been obtained through ethnographic fieldwork in Zanzibar, Tanzania, where a centralised system provides the rural population with electricity. Furthermore, fieldwork and a household survey were conducted amongst customers and staff in the Sunderban Islands, West Bengal, India, which has a distributed system of supply. Zanzibar and the Sunderbans differ in their types of electricity governance structures, technologies, organisation and procedures for metering, billing and supply, as well as in their sociocultural. setting. Nevertheless, in both places customers' moralities and degree of compliance are conditioned by their relationship to their supplier and the particularities of the socio-technical system of provision in which this relation is formed. The issue of trust is central and the findings show how people's level of trust in their supplier becomes jeopardised in both places, but for rather different reasons. Suggestions are provided as to how analytic attention to the customer-supplier relationship, and the material objects that mediate and shape it, could be used for increasing electricity customers' degree of compliance and for promoting sustainable energy systems in general.

The urban context is presented in relation to urban challenges, scopes of urban sustainability and the governance of the urban. Understanding urban context and its dynamics is important for finding the right approaches to tap into the potentials of cities and reroute their development pathways towards sustainability and resilience. The governance of urban sustainability transitions requires new forms of strategic environmental planning processes that integrate diverse sources of knowledge and diverse perspectives. The new planning processes need also to set connections between urban challenges and global, national and regional developments. The challenge remains for urban practitioners and scientists alike to take up a process-content thinking and to reflect on how to navigate societal complexity while mobilizing transformative societal potential towards action for sustainability.

J	Lima, MGB				Lima, Mairon G. Bastos			Corporate Power in the Bioeconomy Transition: The Policies and Politics of Conservative Ecological Modernization in Brazil	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						agriculture; bioeconomy; agri-food systems; sustainability transitions; power relations; biofuels; Amazon; soy; sugarcane; value chains	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; GOVERNANCE; FOOD; ECONOMY; TRANSFORMATION; AGRICULTURE; MOVEMENT; REGIME; CROPS	The bioeconomy transition is a double-edged sword that may either address fossil fuel dependence sustainably or aggravate human pressures on the environment, depending on how it is pursued. Using the emblematic case of Brazil, this article analyzes how corporate agribusiness dominance limits the bioeconomy agenda, shapes innovation pathways, and ultimately threatens the sustainability of this transition. Drawing from scholarship on power in agri-food governance and sustainability transitions, an analytical framework is then applied to the Brazilian case. The analysis of current policies, recent institutional changes and the case-specific literature reveals that, despite a strategic framing of the bioeconomy transition as a panacea for job creation, biodiversity conservation and local development (particularly for the Amazon region), in practice major soy, sugarcane and meatpacking conglomerates dominate Brazil's bioeconomy agenda. In what can be described as conservative ecological modernization, there is some reflexivity regarding environmental issues but also an effort to maintain (unequal) social and political structures. Significant agribusiness dominance does not bode well for smallholder farmers, food diversity or natural ecosystems, as major drivers of deforestation and land-use change (e.g., soy plantations, cattle ranching) gain renewed economic and political stimulus as well as greater societal legitimacy under the bioeconomy umbrella.

It focuses on institutional conditions that support the integration of 'radical', transition-oriented perspectives and ideas (i.e. perspectives stressing the need for changed social power relations and 'other' norms and visions for the future,) in local governance, with a specific focus on small municipalities. Inspired by transition literature and theory on institutional capacity, the paper explores frames of reference, relational resources, and mobilisation capacity. Empirically, the paper builds on research in two small municipalities in Sweden, where we studied documents on policy for local development, and energy and land-use planning, and carried out qualitative interviews with politicians, planners, and actors from local industry and civil society. The study provides a rich empirical illustration of specific conditions that affect the possibilities to work with transition oriented perspectives in small municipalities.

Can we continue to understand the contract in its relation to the historical unity of state and law considering the massive transformation of the closely related dichotomies between national and international, public and private, and hard law and soft law? What is the role of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the contemporary debate over global value chains (GVCs)? This paper addresses on the role of law in societal challenges arising from the kaleidoscopic view of globalization. GVCs operate through interdependent contracts and in relation to multiple normative orders that impose moral, economic, and legal obligations. This paper seeks to re evaluate the role of contract law in its relation to sustainable and ethical global trade. The perspective it develops prioritizes the interaction between extra-legal considerations in contract law and the momentum of CSR as well as the historical dynamics of law, economics, and politics.

Impacts of aquaculture on social networks in the mangrove systems of northern Vietnam	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Social network analysis; Social capital; Resilience; Social-ecological systems; Natural resource management; Wetland; Sustainable livelihoods; Vulnerability; Adaptive capacity	TIMBER FOREST PRODUCTS; LIVELIHOOD DIVERSIFICATION; RESOURCE-MANAGEMENT; ADAPTATION; RESILIENCE; VULNERABILITY; COMMUNITY; DEPENDENCY; GOVERNANCE; ECOSYSTEM	Mangrove systems are one of the most complex and productive ecosystems on Earth, providing crucial livelihood support to coastal communities in developing countries. However, mangrove systems are being degraded and lost at an alarming rate globally. In Vietnam, the principal threat to mangrove systems is their conversion to aquaculture. Historically, mangrove system dependent communities (MSDC) have responded to change through their livelihoods and social networks, using social capital to self-organise and access crucial livelihood resources. However, little is known about the impact of different degrees of aquaculture on MSDC livelihoods and social networks, and what this means for the resilience of these communities and their ability to self-organise in response to change. Using a quantitative approach based on empirical household survey data, we assess the association between aquaculture and the livelihoods and social networks of three coastal communities of northern Vietnam. Results indicate that greater degrees of aquaculture are associated with: greater income inequality and lower livelihood diversity; and larger and less dense social networks. The increased influence of market-based relations associated with greater degrees of aquaculture has implications for resilience through the socio-economic differentiation and fragmentation of MSDC networks, which reduces social capital and the ability to self-organise in response to change. A diversity of network ties is required in order to connect various groups within MSDC. This can enable shared identification and understanding of the issues facing mangrove systems in order to facilitate self-organisation, and foster the resilience necessary for the sustainable governance of mangrove systems.

J	Lebel, L; Wattana, S; Talerngsri, P				Lebel, Louis; Wattana, Suchada; Talerngsri, Pawin			Assessments of ecosystem services and human well-being in Thailand build and create demand for coproductive capacity	ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY			English	Article						assessment; coproductive capacity; ecosystem services; evidence-based planning; human well-being; problem driven	SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; PARTICIPATORY APPROACH; RESILIENCE; KNOWLEDGE	Assessments of ecosystem services have been proposed as one way of incorporating concerns about environmental change and ecosystem conditions into subnational development planning. In Thailand a policy window for such initiatives is opening because of a transition in national policy toward area-based planning combined with broader political reforms to expand public participation and encourage more evidence-based decision making. We explored three case studies in Thailand in which central and local government agencies and research organizations partnered to engage local communities and other stakeholders in assessments of ecosystem services and human well-being. The analysis focused on the role ecosystem assessments play in building and creating demand for coproductive capacity. By coproductive capacities we mean the ability to combine scientific resources and governance capabilities in ways that bring about informed social change. We found evidence that the assessments built capacities for governance actors to explore scientific and research-based evidence, to consult scientific experts, and then to evaluate existing policies and plans using this newly acquired information. At the same time, scientific experts also learned to explore public policy issues, to consult planners and decision makers in government, and based on this knowledge to evaluate scientific evidence and revise the scope and goals of their research and analytical activities to better meet policy needs and demands. Coproductive capacities were built when various stakeholders jointly engaged in compilation and interpretation of evidence. Doing so helped legitimize the assessment process with positive feedback on both governance and science capacities. We also found evidence, however, of significant cultural and institutional constraints to designing and making better use of ecosystem services assessments. These constraints included insufficient resources for both knowledge making and decision making. Power relations and organizational culture likewise had implications for capacities to govern and do science. Nevertheless, by creating demand for greater capacities, assessments contribute to improving the quality of evidence-based social change.

In this study, we propose an emergy-based ecological footprint (EEF) analysis framework. Shanghai was selected as a case study city to see its dynamic changes from 2007 to 2016. The results show that Shanghai had a large ecological deficit, an extremely high ecological footprint intensity and a poor coordination relationship between its ecological system and its economic system, indicating a great ecological challenge that it is facing. The uneven distribution of its emergy ecological footprint is mainly due to the large share of fossil fuels land type. But with the city's great efforts, the overall ecological pressure has been reduced and the coordination relationship has also been improved, while the local economy is still booming. Pearson correlation analysis further indicates that the city's policy on developing tertiary industry has resulted in a positive effect on improving the coordinating relationship. The ratio between the output value of heavy industry and gross industrial output value has the most negative correlation with the coordinating relationship. Finally, policy recommendations are raised by considering the local realities. These recommendations can also provide valuable insights to other megacities with similar challenges.

Industrial ecology: a review	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE			English	Review						Industrial ecology; Review; Governance of material flows; Dematerialisation		Industrial ecology is both a vision, a research field, and a source of inspiration for practical work. Its proponents aim to contribute to sustainable development by closing materials cycles and realising a fundamental paradigm shift in the thinking concerning industry-ecology relations. Dominant research lines in industrial ecology focus on industrial metabolism and life cycle tools. The underlying assumption is that the flow and transformation of materials can be managed through the correcting of market and regulatory failures which are causes of environmental degradation. This literature review suggests, on the one hand, that the manageability of the flow of materials is currently limited by market and regulatory failures which inhibit the implementation of the principles of industrial ecology and, on the other hand, that the flow and transformation of materials are only partly affected by prices, information and laws.

J	Blackburn, S; Pelling, M				Blackburn, Sophie; Pelling, Mark			The political impacts of adaptation actions: Social contracts, a research agenda	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Review						Adaptation; fairness; politics; social contracts; transformation	GLOBAL CHANGE; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DISASTER RISK; RESILIENCE; CONSTRUCTION; GOVERNANCE; CAPACITY; SCIENCE; STATE	Managing climate and disaster risk is a deeply political act sitting at the interface of popular expectations, legal mandate, and political fiat. This article makes the case for an expanded research agenda on social contracts in climate and disasters scholarship as a mechanism to better reveal activity across this interface, identify the winners and losers of adaptation, and improve the equity outcomes of negotiated and imposed risk management settlements. Social contracts are defined as multiple and constructed (not singular or fixed), and three distinct yet intersecting forms of social contracts are identified: imagined, practiced, and legal-institutional. The article argues that mapping the disjunctures, overlaps and transitions between these concurrent social contracts can help reveal gaps between responsibilities held de facto and de jure. This makes a timely contribution to understanding tensions between need, obligation and entitlement that underlie contestations over who is responsible for what in risk governance. It also helps reveal the dynamic boundaries of social acceptances at the centre of debates around fair adaptation governance. Such work can provide insight on how development relations, including but reaching beyond risk management and climate change adaptation, can be transformed progressively and fairly in a changing climate.

J	Elmustapha, H; Hoppe, T; Bressers, H				Elmustapha, Houda; Hoppe, Thomas; Bressers, Hans			Comparing two pathways of strategic niche management in a developing economy; the cases of solar photovoltaic and solar thermal energy market development in Lebanon	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Strategic niche management; Niche formation; Developing economy; Donor programs; Renewable energy; Solar energy	SUSTAINABILITY; TRANSITIONS; INVESTMENT; FIELD	There is abundant solar potential in the Middle East North Africa region. Yet access to sustainable energy is still a fundamental challenge in many countries of this region. In this paper we seek to understand the success and failure of the development and the diffusion of solar energy technologies by analysing using a Strategic Niche Management framework to compare the niche development of solar thermal energy and solar photovoltaics in Lebanon. This paper has two main questions: (1) How have the solar thermal niche and the solar photovoltaic niche developed in Lebanon, and how do they compare? (2) In which ways does the Strategic Niche Management framework help us to understand the development of solar energy niches in a developing country context? To answer these questions, a cross case analysis of solar thermal and solar photovoltaic systems was conducted. Due to the absence of research using Strategic Niche Management in Middle Eastern developing countries, this study uses an illustrative case from a country in this region to contribute new insights. Moreover, unlike the Strategic Niche Management research that only focuses on single case studies, this paper presents the results of a comparative study of two niches. The main Strategic Niche Management propositions were grouped and compared per item (i.e. on voicing and shaping expectations, social networks, and learning). The results show that the solar thermal niche affected the solar photovoltaic niche to a large extent. This was especially in relation to the learning and coordination processes. This has gradually contributed to establishing a clear vision. However, both niches lacked a niche manager who was able to coordinate, manage and maintain the dynamics of the niche processes. It also lacked horizontal collaboration between key actors involved (i.e. ministries). International donors were found to play a crucial role in initiating and shaping the market with certain constraints of prioritization in the region. The paper ends with conclusions and ideas for future research on solar energy niche development in the context of developing countries. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Bostrom, M; Klintman, M				Bostrom, Magnus; Klintman, Mikael			Can we rely on 'climate-friendly' consumption?	JOURNAL OF CONSUMER CULTURE			English	Article						Citizen; climate; consumer information; consumption; responsibility; value-action gap	FOOD-PRODUCTS; CARBON; CONSUMER; CHALLENGES; POLICY; LIMITS	In policy and research on sustainable consumption in general, and climate-oriented consumption specifically, key questions centre around whether people are motivated and prompted to support such consumption. A common claim in the scholarly debate is that policy makers, in face of fundamental governance challenges, refrain from taking responsibility and instead invest unrealistic hopes in that consumers will solve pressing environmental problems through consumer choice. Although green consumption is challenging, specifically climate-friendly consumption is even more so, due to the particularly encompassing, complex and abstract sets of problems and since climate impact concerns the totality of one's consumption. Nevertheless, consumers are called to participate in the task to save the planet. This article draws on existing literature on climate-oriented consumption with the aim of contributing to a proper understanding of the relation between consumer action and climate mitigation. It provides a synthesis and presents key constraining mechanisms sorted under five themes: the value-action gap, individualisation of responsibility, knowledge gap, ethical fetishism and the rebound effect. This article concludes with a discussion of perspectives that endorse a socially embedded view of the citizen-consumer. The discussion indicates pathways for how to counteract the constraining mechanisms and open up room for climate-friendly citizen-consumers.

Rethinking elite persistence in neoliberalism: Foresters and techno-bureaucratic logics in Mexico's community forestry	WORLD DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Community forestry; Elite persistence; Power fields; Techno-bureaucratic forestry; Authoritarian corporatism	NATURAL-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; WORLD-BANK; POLITICAL ECOLOGY; COLLECTIVE ACTION; GRASS-ROOTS; POWER; GOVERNANCE; CAPTURE; REFORM; PROPERTY	Problems of elite capture continue to present challenges for sustainable and equitable forest governance around the world. Our understanding of elite capture, however, remains limited by conceptual approaches that pay insufficient attention to power in its various dimensions. Drawing on critical institutionalism and political ecology, I analyze how the power veiled in political-economic structures or 'power fields', embedded with local institutions and relations of conflict and negotiation, helps (re)produce elite power and persistence. I pay particular attention to the role of foresters as crucial yet understudied elite actors in community forestry. I employ an over-time comparative case study of processes of elite capture in four regional inter-community forestry associations (FAs) in the state of Durango, Mexico. I argue that foresters' persistent capture of FAs is related to multi-layered power inequalities and persistent democratic deficits reproduced by techno-bureaucratic forestry and authoritarian corporatist logics. At the same time, I posit that this capture is not definite but is continually transformed by social struggles and grassroots institutional innovations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

David Bowie and the Art of Slow Innovation: A Fast-Second Winner Strategy for Biotechnology and Precision Medicine Global Development	OMICS-A JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY			English	Review						slow innovation; the fast-second winner; precision medicine; technology foresight; biomarkers and diagnostics; David Bowie	RESPONSIBLE INNOVATION	Original ideas and innovation cannot always be ordered like a courier service and delivered fresh to our desk at 9 am. Yet, most creativity-based organizations, careers, and professions, science and biotechnology innovation included, emphasize the speed as the prevailing ideology. But a narrow focus on speed has several and overlooked shortcomings. For example, it does not offer the opportunity to draw from, and stitch together disparate concepts and practices for truly disruptive innovation. Preventing false starts, learning from others' or our own mistakes, and customizing innovations for local community needs are difficult in a speed-hungry innovation ecosystem. We introduce a new strategy, the Fast-Second Winner, specifically in relation to global development of biotechnologies and precision medicine. This a la carte global development strategy envisions a midstream entry into the innovation ecosystem. Moreover, we draw from the works of the late David Bowie who defied rigid classifications as an artist and prolific innovator, and introduce the concept and practice of slow innovation that bodes well with the Fast-Second Winner strategy. A type of slow innovation, the Fast-Second Winner is actually fast and sustainable in the long term, and efficient by reducing false starts in new precision medicine application contexts and geographies, learning from other innovators' failures, and shaping innovations for the local community needs. The establishment of Centers for Fast-Second Innovation (CFSIs), and their funding, for example, by crowdfunding and other innovative mechanisms, could be timely for omics and precision medicine global development. If precision medicine is about tailoring drug treatments and various health interventions to individuals, we suggest to start from tailoring new ideas, and focus not only on how much we innovate but also what and how we innovate. In principle, the Fast-Second Winner can be applied to omics and other biotechnology responsible development in medical practice or any field of applied innovation.

J	Bulkeley, H; Broto, VC; Maassen, A				Bulkeley, Harriet; Broto, Vanesa Castan; Maassen, Anne			Low-carbon Transitions and the Reconfiguration of Urban Infrastructure	URBAN STUDIES			English	Article						energy; socio-technical system; infrastructure; climate change; urban governance; experiment	POLITICAL ECOLOGY; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; SOCIOTECHNICAL SYSTEMS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INNOVATION; POLICY; CITY; GOVERNANCE; TYPOLOGY; NETWORKS	Over the past decade, a growing body of research has examined the role of cities in addressing climate change and the institutional and political challenges which they encounter. For the most part, in these accounts, the infrastructure networks, their material fabric, everyday practices and political economies, have remained unexamined. In this paper, it is argued that this is a critical omission and an approach is developed for understanding how urban responses to climate change both configure and are configured by infrastructure networks. Central to any such analysis is the conception of how and why (urban) infrastructure networks undergo change. Focusing on urban energy networks and on the case of London, the paper argues for an analysis of the 'urban infrastructure regimes' and 'experiments' through which climate change is governed. It is found that climate change experiments serve as a means through which dominant actors articulate and test new 'low-carbon' logics for urban infrastructure development. It is argued that experiments work by establishing new circuits, configuring actors in new sets of relations and through these means realising the potential for addressing climate change in the city. At the same time, experiments become sites of conflict, a means through which new forms of urban circulation can be confined and marginalised, leaving dominant energy regimes (relatively) intact.

The article reveals the directions to increase the digitalization of the economy, the issues of creating information database for the companies' activities, the strategy of creating equity, increasing the additional cost, providing a continuous reproduction process. Nowadays, information exposure has become an important problem that requires the evolution of the reporting system, increasing the ability to eliminate information gaps in order to meet the needs of different stakeholders, that is to involve them in the corporate governance of economic entities. The paper studies methods and techniques of financial and non-financial information integration through a company's single integrated report to reflect the results how the company uses its resources through the structural elements of capital: production, financial, intellectual, human, natural and social capital. The possibilities to increase the transparency of business by preparing a new model of non-financial reporting based on integrated thinking, which provides a comprehensive assessment of the organization's effectiveness and prospects, provides investors with the information necessary to make more effective decisions on the capital allocation. The methodical bases of the reporting formation for business strategy, opportunities of the company to create additional cost taking into account economic, social and natural factors are defined, that will increase the interest in financial investments to create capitalized value.

A systematic approach was applied in this study to search for articles about SIA models. In the first step, we analysed six main SIA model mappings between 2004 and 2015. In the second step, 98 models were identified. The main findings include the definition of emerging paths for the future research agenda on this topic. Compared with previous SIA mappings, we identified 22 additional models that are related to the sustainability discourse. The meaning of sustainability is defined both by the emergence of new systems in finance that require specific metrics and in relation to the global agenda towards sustainable development. It is interesting to notice how social impact models, sustainability indicators (under the global framework of sustainable development goals (SDGs)) and new financial scores (such as environmental, social and governance (ESGs)) are converging into a common discourse, even if divergence is still present, and further research is needed to unlock the relationships among them.

Participatory research was conducted in caivas in the Northern Plateau, Santa Catarina State, to identify strategies to intensify pasture use and increase animal productivity. To better understand the outcomes of these strategies, a sustainability assessment was conducted in properties that participated in the research (improved caivas; IC) and those that did not (traditional caivas; TC). The Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture Systems (SAFA) tool 2.0.0 for smallholders was chosen as it evaluates the productive unit as a whole using environmental, social, economic, and governance indicators and is tailored for small-scale production. All evaluated indicators showed higher scores for IC properties in relation to TC. In general, the SAFA analysis showed that when evaluated as productive systems, TCs are a strategic option for rural development, as 65% of their indicators were evaluated as good. With the support of rural outreach and research and the adoption of appropriate technologies, this percentage increased to 86% in ICs. These results confirm that with adequate support caivas can significantly contribute to the development of more sustainable livestock farming in Southern Brazil.

J	Shi, JW				Shi, Jianwen			Study on the Decoupling Relationship and Rebound Effect between Agricultural Economic Growth and Water Footprint: A Case of Yangling Agricultural Demonstration Zone, China	WATER			English	Article						economic growth; water footprint; decoupling relation; rebound effect; Yangling	RIVER; QUALITY	The coordinated development of the economy, water resources, and environment is key to the concept of sustainable development. In this study, in respect to the water footprint, it calculated the water resource input and sewage dilution for the Yangling Agricultural Demonstration Area during the agricultural economic growth period from 1999 to 2019. This study also established the Tapio decoupling analysis model on this basis to study the decoupling relationship between economic growth and the water resource environment, as well as its evolution law. A residual free-complete decomposition model was introduced to analyze the influence of the water resource input and sewage dilution on the agricultural economic growth in the Yangling Demonstration Area and its transmission mechanism. The results showed the following: (1) the economic growth and the blue and green water footprints of the Yangling Demonstration Area were decoupled from one another from 1999 to 2019, and the degree of decoupling between economic growth and the grey-water footprint was poor, indicating that economic growth had a more obvious promotion effect on the reduction of water resource consumption, and the pressure on the water environment was increased year by year; (2) the main factor affecting the reduction of water resource consumption in the Yangling Demonstration Area was the effect of technology, and this was greater than the effect of water resource consumption increments resulting from the expansion of the economic scale; (3) the progress of environmental governance technology was the main reason for the decrease in the grey-water footprint in the Yangling Demonstration Area. To improve the quality of our economic development, the pattern of economic development should be transformed to regulate economic growth and expand the scale, reducing water consumption, improving pollutant emission control technology, and making full use of water resources to provide evidence for a reasonable water resource management policy.

Uganda's refugee 'success story', corruption and the international community	THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY			English	Article						Uganda; donors; international community; agency; UNHCR; migration and refugees	AFRICAN AGENCY; POLITICS; OPPORTUNITIES; DONORS; AID	The progressive refugee policy of the Ugandan government has been widely applauded as a success story, and Uganda has been depicted as a role model. This article argues how the perceived success created a situation of mutual dependency between the Ugandan government and the international community. While the Ugandan government relied on aid from the international community, the international community had interests in the success story as proof that their policies work (for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees), and in response to the European migration crisis (for bilateral donor governments). Nevertheless, in 2018, it emerged that the Ugandan refugee policy suffered from large-scale corruption. The article argues that the mutual dependency provided a fertile breeding ground for corruption, and negatively impacted accountability. Similarly to how the Museveni regime has been able to benefit from an image of success to deflect accountability on governance transgressions in the past, it has now largely managed to evade accountability for corruption in its refugee policy.

Empowerment of fisherfolk organization and strengthening or development of their capacity, especially in relation to leadership, is important to the successful implementation of the 2014 Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries in the Context of Food Security and Poverty Eradication (SSF Guidelines) and the realization of sustainable fisheries and stewardship. Leadership is a challenging and relatively recent fisheries research topic, and gender is poorly documented in Caribbean fisheries. The deficiency of knowledge on leadership and gender was addressed through fisherfolk organization leader assessments to assist in understanding capacities and gaps in Caribbean fisherfolk organization leadership for informing gender and other aspects of overall SSF Guidelines implementation. Our work contributes to a baseline of knowledge on fisher organization leaders in the region. It confirms some already known information on fisherfolk organizations, documenting this and new information. Dimensions such as decision-making, gender, participation, governance, education and assets relevant to fisherfolk leadership are covered in the leadership profile developed. We discuss the implications of this preliminary and exploratory applied research for Caribbean fisheries in the context of the SSF Guidelines, and a way forward.

J	Gupta, J; Schmeier, S				Gupta, Joyeeta; Schmeier, Susanne			Future proofing the principle of no significant harm	INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS-POLITICS LAW AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						No-harm; No significant harm; Sovereignty; Responsibility; Equity; Water law; Environmental law; Sustainable development goals	CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOUTH-ASIA; RESPONSIBILITY; LIABILITY; PREVENT	The principle of 'no significant harm' as a way of addressing transboundary environmental challenges is both inadequately researched and inadequately implemented in many parts of the world. This paper addresses the questions: What is the nature of transboundary harm in the Anthropocene? Is the principle of no significant harm able to address current and pre-empt future transboundary harm in the field of water and environmental law? This special issue has focused on this principle in the arena of water law. This article integrates the findings in the context of a broader understanding of global harm in the Anthropocene. We draw 4 conclusions. First, conceptually harm is moving beyond direct inter-state harm between neighbouring countries to a multi-directional, multi-actor/multi-level harm, which is increasingly creeping and cumulative, with growing spatial and temporal characteristics. It thus requires moving beyond quibbling over what is 'significant' harm to recognize the climate emergency, the sixth biodiversity extinction, the huge damage to water systems and to realize that the threshold of ecosystem and human tolerance of damage are reducing rapidly. Second, however, the no-harm principle tends to be better developed in qualifying sovereignty in relation to transboundary harm on rivers than in the broader environmental and development arena as demonstrated by agenda 2030 which reverts to full permanent sovereignty. Third, legal scholarship, however, does provide a wide range of instruments for addressing harm before it occurs, after it has happened, and considering the differentiated economic capacity of the actors. Finally, the larger problem is that it is not individual projects or programmes that cause problems as much as national prioritization of economic growth which has led to externalizing the environment. The no-harm principle will be ineffective if it cannot be used to question the content of 'growth'-led policies. There is need to future proof the no-harm principle.

J	Neuwirth, RJ				Neuwirth, Rostam J.			LAW, TIME AND OXYMORA: A SYNAESTHETIC EXPLORATION OF THE FUTURE ROLE OF CUSTOMARY GLOBAL LAW	REVISTA GENERAL DE DERECHO PUBLICO COMPARADO			English	Article						Global Law; Customary Law; Legal Synaesthesia; Holonomic Paradigm; Oxymora and Paradoxes	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; GLOBALIZATION	For a future global legal order capable of addressing the most serious contemporary problems to emerge a new understanding of law and its related concepts needs to be sought. This search requires first the creation of new tools of perception and eventually a cognitive revolution as institutional changes are usually preceded by cognitive changes. Cognitive changes, on the other hand, can be measured by changes in language, in technology, and in law. At the same time, important changes can also be driven by law. It is therefore important to take notice of drastic changes in the context and discuss them in the legal realm. Generally, a recent rise in the number of oxymora and paradoxes used in science and in law seem to suggest a silent cognitive revolution requiring also a new thinking in legal terms. This article will briefly exemplify the ramifications of this rise by reference to the two related concepts of "sustainable development" and "customary global law", both of which have tellingly been identified as oxymora. These two and other oxymora also indicate an important shift in the perception of time, as perhaps "the greatest remaining mystery" in the present world. This shift in the perception of time and the changing cognitive conditions will be discussed by virtue of the related terms of synaesthesia and holonomy, which both share an emphasis on the relation between different parts and the whole by way of a greater integration of different sources of information. Such greater integration of different sources of sensory and other kinds of information, possibly achieved by a future homo synaestheticus, will be needed if humanity were to successfully tackle the current serious challenges as posed by the global governance debate in the 21st century.

Despite some attention across urban studies, the need to interrogate how new forms of urban carbon governance are transforming infrastructure space remains pressing. This paper examines the low-carbon restructuring of the waste system in Mbale, Uganda, a town struggling to address its socio-ecological futures. The paper asserts that a UPE approach to how urban carbon governance is materialised advances three particular concerns; the governing of urban circulation, carbon capital and socio-material relations. Through examining these, the paper shows how global actors are increasingly involved in low-carbon transformation, use places such as Mbale as spaces of experimentation and dominate the governing of this restructuring. Yet out of such unjust processes new forms of contestation and low-carbon politics may emerge.

The main purpose of this research is to propose a research model that generates relevant information to establish sustainable management strategies in rural areas close to the protected areas of the Dominican Republic, with the aim of promoting the social economy of the communities. The methodology used to carry out the study consisted of an analysis of the existing literature review in relation to rural development, tourism and protected areas, in addition to applying the qualitative method of participant observation. The model proposed in this study aims to know the assessments, opinions and perceptions of all the actors involved in tourism that takes place in the ANP. Based on the data obtained with the application of the model, it will be possible to design, plan and apply a management plan for sustainable tourism management, which guarantees local governance of tourism by residents.

J	de Kraker, J				de Kraker, Joop			Social learning for resilience in social-ecological systems	CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article							NATURAL-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; ADAPTIVE GOVERNANCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INNOVATION; COMMUNITY; KNOWLEDGE; ORGANIZATIONS; COMANAGEMENT; PERSPECTIVE; ADAPTATION	Fostering of social learning is generally considered an important governance instrument to build resilience in social-ecological systems. Empirical studies addressing the contribution of social learning to resilience are scarce however, and do not provide direct evidence but infer this contribution from the impacts of social learning on system governance and management. These impacts are found more frequently at the local level than at higher, regional or national levels, probably depending on the overlap between participants in social learning and actors in governance and management. Recent studies have shown that at higher levels a connection between social learning and policy can be achieved through bridging actors or organizations, and vertical linkages between governance levels. Conceptually and methodologically the study of social learning and its relation with resilience has advanced sufficiently to enable more rigorous and detailed empirical research. This should focus on how attempts to foster social learning within social-ecological governance systems can be made more effective and efficient, for example, through the use of new technologies to support the learning process or through the creation of permanent, informal multistakeholder learning spaces within formal policy structures.

We explore what approaches align with plural valuation on the ground, as well as how different social-ecological contexts play a role in translating plural valuation into decisions and outcomes. Based on a co-constructed analytical approach relying on empirical information from ten cases from the Global South, we find that plural valuation contributes to equitable and sustainable outcomes if the valuation process: 1) is based on participatory value elicitation approaches; 2) is framed with a clear action-oriented purpose; 3) provides space for marginalized stakeholders to articulate their values in ways that can be included in decisions; 4) is used as a tool to identify and help reconcile different cognitive models about human-nature relations; and 5) fosters open communication and collaboration among stakeholders. We also find that power asymmetries can hinder plural valuation. As interest and support for undertaking plural valuation grows, a deeper understanding is needed regarding how it can be adapted to different purposes, approaches, and social-ecological contexts in order to contribute to social equity and sustainability.

Technical cooperation within the context of foreign aid: trends for the CEE countries in transition (1991-2004)	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	IIAS Symposium on International Aid and Public Administration	2008	Ankara, TURKEY	IIAS		countries in transition; foreign aid; improving governance; technical assistance	DONOR INTEREST MODELS; RECIPIENT NEED; ALLOCATION	This article investigates technical assistance (TA) to CEE countries in relation to development aid in general. There is plenty of literature examining the foreign aid, but specific components of aid, like technical assistance, remain largely unexplored. One debate about development aid focuses on whether aid is primarily given to improve the situation in the recipient countries or if this improvement is simply a side-effect from aid based on political-military factors. This article argues that development aid, unlike technical assistance, is often provided based on political-military factors with the accompanying side-effect of improving the situation. To investigate aid money to CEE countries during their transition (1990-2004), we used data from OECD DAC that distinguishes technical assistance as a component of foreign aid. The analysis shows that the foreign aid to CEE countries in general seems to have been largely determined by political factors while the money provided for TA is shown to be especially determined by the recipient countries' needs. The technical assistance has proved to be much more sustainable. The article concludes that empirical research should analyze the components of aid separately.

A smart city is a technological solution that integrates engineering and information systems to assist in managing these scarce resources. A smart city comprises several intelligent services such as smart grids, smart education, smart transportation, smart buildings, smart waste management and so on. Among all these, smart grids are the nucleus of all the facilities because these provide sustainable electrical supply for other smart services to operate seamlessly. Smart grids integrate information and communication technologies (ICT) into traditional energy grids, thereby capturing massive amounts of data from several devices like smart meters, sensors, and other electrical infrastructures. The data collected in smart grids are heterogeneous and require data analytic techniques to extract meaningful information to make informed decisions. We term this enormous amount of data as big energy data. This book chapter discusses progress in the field of big energy data by enlisting different studies that cover several data management aspects such as data collection, data preprocessing, data integration, data storage, data analytics, data visualisation and decision-making. We also discuss various challenges in data management and report recent progress in this field. Finally, we present open research areas in big data management especially in relation to smart grids.

My inquiry is inspired by the question posed by James Ferguson and Tania Murray Li: what do development schemes do? I analyse a renewable energy pilot project in Tanzania that was implemented by an NGO, which eventually failed to continue its service delivery but still produced important effects. Conceptually, I build on and extend previous arguments about how development projects produce depoliticizing effects, have ambiguous effects, and reproduce unequal relations of power. Building on feminist and sociotechnical relational approaches to power, I identify when and where in the encounter between energy project and local community that these, and other, effects emerge. Case study data was collected by qualitative methodology, and consists of project documentation, observation, and interviews with actors involved. The study shows how particular material, social, emotional, and economic effects emerged from the encounter between the project and local society. Feedback between technical problems, financial difficulties, and social tensions created a downward spiral resulting in system failure. It had negative effects on the credibility of actors and on trust relations. I argue that asking what decentralized electrification schemes actually 'do' can provide insight relevant to energy geography, as the focus on effects reveals the sociotechnical and political relations through which electricity becomes possible and how it may reconfigure local places. The case study shows why and how a small-scale, renewable energy project only temporarily repositioned actors and places, produced ambiguous effects, and maintained unequal power relations.

We explore the politics and political economy of how the nexus around food, energy, and water is being governed through initiatives to promote climate-smart agriculture (CSA) as it moves from the global to the local. We combine an analysis of how these interrelationships are being governed (and ungoverned) by key global institutions with reflection on the consequences of this for developing countries that are being targeted by CSA initiatives. In particular, we look at Kenya as a country heavily dependent on agriculture, but also subject to some of the worst effects of climate change and which has been a focus for a range of bilateral and multilateral donors with their preferred visions of CSA. We draw on strands of literature in global environmental politics, political ecology, and the political economy of development to make sense of the power dynamics that characterize the multiscalar politics of how CSA is translated, domesticated, and operationalized in practice.

B	Rao, PK	Rao, PK			Rao, P. K.	Rao, PK		Green Economic Policies: Regional and Global Levels	ARCHITECTURE OF GREEN ECONOMIC POLICIES			English	Article; Book Chapter							LAW	This chapter focuses on the priority sectors agriculture (with reference to industrial livestock sub-sector) and forestry for their roles in climate change, examines the relationship between Green Economic Policies and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), summarizes some of the regional trade and environment agreements and emerging scenarios of global trade reform. An important area of environmental governance relates to the law and application of international environmental law and its role in institutional reforms for better governance of the environment. Global financial and economic policies are largely influenced by the sovereign nations' policies, and also by the coordination arrangements of the powerful country blocks such as the Group-of-Eight (G-8) and Group-of-Twenty (G-20) countries. In addition, the role and contributions of the United Nations group of organizations, and the Bretton Woods institutions (The International Monetary Fund, The World Bank, and the World Trade Organization), multilateral development banks (MDBs) are significant in policy formulations and operations. Besides, the role of the UN charter bodies such as the UN Development Programme (UNDP), UN Environmental Programme (UNEP), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and scientific bodies such as the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are important in their policy guidance and/or operations affecting development policy in general and environment in particular. Also relevant are the Official Development Assistance (ODA) being coordinated by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and several resourceful private foundations and charity organizations/non-governmental entities. This chapter deals with some of the critical issues and sectors of significance and urgency in the context of sustainable development and adoption of Green Economic Policies (GEP). The recent policies toward adaptation and mitigation of the adverse effects of climate change (CC) are briefly examined, as well as the activities in relation to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the scope of environment under some of the regional trade agreements. The role of institutional environment deserves substantial additional attention and this includes the role of strengthened international environmental laws.

The whole economic system in which people operate must be circular, which means that it must eliminate conflicting aspects related to regulation, collaboration, governance, supply chain dynamics, and data transparency. However, the barriers to the transition to a circular economy are substantial, and it is up to states to work together to find innovative solutions to society's problems. This article focuses on aspects related to eco-innovation in the field of drinking water quality in all administrative regions of Romania. In this regard, a study was undertaken, and the main objective pursued in was to identify and highlight the degree of eco-innovation of drinking water suppliers in seven underdeveloped regions of Romania. Starting from an analysis of the water management framework through the OECD Principles on Water Governance, it was possible to develop a study on drinking water supply companies in Romania. This study was performed based on specific indicators grouped by categories, and it aimed in two directions: on the one hand, the identification of drinking water distributors with a high degree of eco-innovation, which leads to quality certification of the drinking water supplied and which has the impact of encouraging household consumers to mainly use this type of supplied water to the detriment of PET bottled water (which has well-known major disadvantages in relation to environmental pollution and user health); on the other hand, the identification of drinking water supply companies with a low degree of eco-innovation, which is proof of the need for mandatory measures to improve drinking water quality, measures that can be taken at the supplier level but especially with support from the administrative and political environment.

It is mainly focused on solutions using living organisms (in particular plants and microorganisms) to perform functions such as those of soil-and water-bioengineering interventions in order to ensure the safety of human infrastructures and constructions in contexts of conflict between natural processes and human needs. Further, it handles the problematic of reintroducing natural processes and functions in the built environment (urban, industrial, infrastructures, etc.) in order to recover, recreate, or reinvent nature in humanized landscapes and developing a more creative relation between humans and natural elements, processes, and functions. It presents, furthermore, the contribution of natural solutions to a wide variety of decontamination processes and prevention and recovery of degraded land and natural resources.

Previous researches concentrations on HWM have been transferred from technologies, economic, and ecological benefits to social relations because the coordination and cooperation among different stakeholders determine the efficiency of HWM. To analyze stakeholder coordination in HWM, this paper employed a mixed-method combined with stakeholder analysis(SA) and social network analysis(SNA), for analyzing interests, powers, attitudes, knowledge of different stakeholders, and the characteristics, power quantification of the stakeholders' coordination network, by chosen Shanghai Hangzhou bay economic and technical development park(SHDP) as a case study area. In hazardous waste management, governmental supervision has enough interest but less power and with the complete knowledge on, third-party supervision has a medium interest but less knowledge to support their supervision, firms have the lowest power but interest, waste treatment and disposal company have most power and interest but limited knowledge. NGOs, research institutes and media have interest and knowledge but less power. Most stakeholders have positive attitude. We also find that local supervisions play an important role in stakeholder coordination, and NGOs and research institutes have the most potential to push stakeholder coordination by improving information exchange. Therefore, policy recommendations are proposed, including the establishment of communication mechanisms, the adoption of hazardous treatment regulations and economic instruments, the application of a platform for information exchange, and the encouragement of stakeholders' engagement and public participation.

The system in question is the Brazilian community of Itabira, Minas Gerais, host to an iron ore operation of Vale, the world's second largest mining corporation. Utilizing a resilience assessment framework, this study describes the various components of the Itabira social-ecological system revealing the challenges brought about by mining's dominance. Data collection included literature reviews and semi-structured interviews with 29 individuals representing different stakeholder groups. Findings revealed that, despite recent efforts by government to regulate the industry, the mine continues to generate press and pulse disturbances that impact the resilience of the community. Operating from the standpoint that resilience depends largely upon the management capacity of stakeholders, the research identifies three ways to improve mining governance in Itabira. First, there is a need for local government to have more power in dealings with the corporation. Concurrent with this power, however, the municipality must demonstrate ownership over its fate, ideally through the creation of a sustainability plan. Finally, all key parties must demonstrate commitment to cooperating to resolve outstanding disturbances, even when these fall outside the regulatory approval process. While Itabira will remain a mining town for the foreseeable future, actions taken now to address challenges will only strengthen community well-being and sustainability moving forward.

But the resulting kaleidoscope of donor-driven projects has often overlooked the need to create a sense of ownership by beneficiaries. In part this is because it is unclear what political and social structures effectively facilitate activism in situations where state-society relations are contentious. We use Cambodia's unusual success creating and sustaining a labor rights regime to illustrate the dynamics behind one type of social regime change that has opened up governance over worker protections in a sustainable and potentially replicable way.

Spatio-temporal patterns of domestic water distribution, consumption and sufficiency: Neighbourhood inequalities in Nairobi, Kenya	HABITAT INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Water distribution; Water sufficiency; Water inequality; Urban water consumption; Sustainable development	ACCESS; INDIA	Whilst there are longstanding and well-established inequalities in safe-drinking water-access between urban and rural areas, there remain few studies of changing intra-urban inequalities over time. In this study, we determined the spatio-temporal patterns of domestic piped water distribution in Nairobi, Kenya between 1985 and 2018, and the implications of socio-economic and neighbourhood inequalities in water sufficiency. Using data from the Nairobi water and sewerage utility company for the period 2008-2018, we examined the sufficiency of monthly domestic water consumption per capita for 2380 itineraries (areas with an average population of 700) in relation to a residential neighbourhood classification, population and neighbourhood age and also examined water rationing patterns by neighbourhood type. Water sufficiency differed by residential areas, age of neighbourhood and population per itinerary. Compared to residents of low-income areas, those in high-and middle-income areas were six and four times more likely to receive the recommended 1500 L per capita per month respectively. Newer neighbourhoods and less densely populated areas were more likely to receive higher volumes of water. Non revenue water loss accounted for 29% (average 3.5 billion litres per month) of water distributed across Nairobi, and was more than two times the amount of water needed for all residents to access the recommended monthly per capita water consumption. The observed spatial inequality in distribution, and access to piped water associated with socio-economic status and neighbourhood age highlights the need for deliberate planning and governance to improve water distribution to match the speed of growth of low/middle-and low-income residential areas and enhance equity.

Characterization of an artisanal fishery in Argentina using the social-ecological systems framework	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS			English	Article						Coastal management; community-based management; institutional analysis; Ostrom's framework; social-ecological system	BAHIA BLANCA ESTUARY; MANAGEMENT; COMMUNITY; INSTITUTIONS; GOVERNANCE; TRAGEDY; COMMONS	Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) studies how institutions (the rules of the game of a society) determine the performance of a social-economic system. Elinor Ostrom extends the institutional analysis to the collective action for a particular case, the study of the social-ecological systems (SESs) (Ostrom 1990). Any group that attempts to manage a common resource (e.g. aquifers, pastures) for optimal sustainable production must solve a set of problems in order to create institutions to facilitate collective action. Some evidences show that following a set of design principles in creating institutions can lead to overcome these problems. The aim of the paper is to apply the SES framework to an artisanal fishery community in Argentina in order to: 1) describe the principal features, key variables and relations of the small-scale fishery system; 2) detect the principal drivers of a potential common-management and the leading detractors from the current communal performance; and 3) analyze the possibility that a self-governing for sustainable fishery may appear. Several drivers for potential common-management and some detractors from the current common performance are summarized. Artisanal fishery SES is currently at a bifurcation point. A common historical and cultural root, the presence of leaderships, the relevance of local knowledge, the dependence on the resource to sustainable livelihoods and the threat of big-scale fisheries area have generated incentives to collectiveaction. But, simultaneously, internal conflicts are the most important barrier for an integrated community-based management. The heterogeneity among actors and the relevant external conditions have resulted in two groups diverging in their self-organization. The work is framed by the project COMET-LA (COmmunity-based Management of Environmental challenges in Latin America; European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme of Research and Development), which aims to identify sustainable community-based governance for the management of natural resources that can be used in different social-ecological systems in a context of climate change and increasing competition in the use of resources.

J	Kirby, DS; Visser, C; Hanich, Q				Kirby, David Sean; Visser, Candice; Hanich, Quentin			Assessment of eco-labelling schemes for Pacific tuna fisheries	MARINE POLICY			English	Article						Eco-labelling; Pacific tuna; Precautionary approach; Ecosystem approach	EASTERN TROPICAL PACIFIC; DOLPHINS	Developments in fisheries governance in recent decades notably the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and its implementing agreements have established a framework of principles, standards, institutions and regulations that is broader and more complex than traditional fisheries management, which has generally focused on individual target species. As this framework has evolved, a number of seafood eco-labelling schemes have also developed. These schemes aim to identify well-managed fisheries and give competitive advantage to their products, thus translating the environmental awareness of consumers into direct support for sustainable fishing practices. This paper evaluates a number of these schemes in the context of international fisheries governance principles and considers the conservation benefits that may result from sustainability certification of Pacific tuna fisheries. The paper briefly summarises developments in eco-labeling of Pacific tuna fisheries in relation to the evolution of fisheries management, where focus has shifted from the maximum sustainable yield of individual tuna species to ecosystem-based approaches that directly consider the broader environmental impacts of fishing. The paper discusses two different 'Dolphin Safe' eco-labels, the third-party scheme of the Earth Island Institute and the intergovernmental scheme of the Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Program, and two broader eco-labels offering sustainability certification of fisheries, 'Friend of the Sea' and the 'Marine Stewardship Council'. The role played by seafood-industry associations with sustainability claims, such as the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation, is also considered. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

While "treading water" and "sinking" partly describe legal conditions at the millennium, this paper examines seven challenges in the international environmental law field which at the very least promise to make for a "hard swim" in coming decades. Those challenges include: coping with the proliferation of negotiated instruments; overcoming political opposition to environmental commitments; clarifying the jurisprudential underpinnings of international environmental law; sorting out the relation of environmental ethics, science and the rule of law; fleshing out the principles of sustainable development; addressing practical problems of implementing international responsibilities; and visioning future paths of ocean governance.

NFR is a comprehensive term that includes several forms of reporting, such as CSR reporting, integrated reporting (IR), SDG reporting, GRI reporting, and GHG reporting, among others. The lack of a common standard in NFR has generated discrepancies in NFR managerial practices around the globe. As a result, this study aims to summarise the various NFR practices and the evolution of NFR research by providing a review based on the most influential articles published between 2012 and 2020. We used bibliometric analysis to identify eight research areas: the content of non-financial reports, the IR framework, the relation of NFR with firm-level variables, the relationship between NFR and corporate governance, the theories behind NFR, NFR assurance, the relationship between institutional context and NFR, and environmental reporting. We propose a summary of the literature, together with the best managerial practices that have emerged in recent years. The present study also offers methodological best practices for conducting literature reviews grounded on bibliometric analysis (applying the visualisation of similarities - VOS - method) through a ten-step process, which guarantees the reproducibility of the study by applying quality assurance protocols from medical fields, such as PRISMA and AMSTAR 2.

ECONOMIC RESOURCES OF ETHNOCULTURAL DIVERSITY	MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA			Russian	Article						immigration; diversity; multiculturalism; ethnic economies; ethnocultural resources; complementarities between competences; innovations; international economic relations; economic growth; integration		Global migration radically increases the number of foreign born and their descendents, as well as birthplace, linguistic, ethnic and confessional diversity of the population in more developed regions of the world. Such cultural heterogeneity is being translated into a motley mosaic of cultural identities changing in the course of intercultural contacts through the lifespan and with succeeding generations. The economic effects of immigration cannot be comprehensively explained as part of traditional economic theory without taking into account the factor of culture and its economic resources. On the one hand, the economy of diversity is based on cultural capital which presupposes cultural predisposition of certain diasporas representatives to business activities, and on resources of economic agents belonging to the same culture. On the other hand, such effects are generated by usage of special assets of cultural multiplicity being formed through interaction of cognitions, values, norms and practices referring to different cultures and influencing economic preferences, choices and other forms of economic behavior. Multicultural composition of a receiving society is being reproduced in multiplicity of "ethnic economies" on the back of the "big economy", as well as in joint economic activities of descendents from different states and civilization areas implementing complementarities between competences relevant to different types of mentalities. The usage of such resources makes local economies more balanced, contributes to increase in productivity, innovation and foreign trade, making development more dynamic, competitive and sustainable. At the same time, cultural diversity may generate economic losses due to ethnolinguistic fragmentation of receiving societies and conflicts within them. Adequate immigration policies, in particular, an efficient governance of cultural diversity, successful migrant integration outcomes and collaborative intercultural relations are crucial for making the benefits of diversity overweight the risks of ethno-cultural fragmentation in receiving societies.

Participation as Relational Space: A Critical Approach to Analysing Participation in Sustainability Research	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						spaces of participation; critical studies of participation; power relations; co-production; transdisciplinary sustainability research; transformation; relational approaches	TRANSDISCIPLINARY KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION; PUBLIC-PARTICIPATION; SCIENCE; POWER; COPRODUCTION; PERSPECTIVES; GOVERNANCE; ENGAGEMENT; APPRAISAL; PROJECTS	In the field of sustainability, scholars, and policy-makers herald the transformative power of participation in knowledge production. However, a discrepancy between these expectations and the limited understanding of the complex interactions constituting participation processes can be observed. With the aim of critically analysing these complex interactions, this paper develops a conceptual perspective on participation as a relational space which is formed in the interplay of structures and processes. This perspective is applied to the analysis of empirical literature in sustainability research, development research, and science and technology studies. The literature review guided by the proposed conceptualisation systematically draws together the rich experience with participation in knowledge production. Elements constituting participation spaces along the dimensions 'structures' and 'actors' are identified and discussed in relation to 'processes' of space-making: (i) (in)coherences with reference system, (ii) resources, (iii) timing, (iv) expectations, (v) mutual trust, and (vi) worldviews and values. Power relations are found to pervade the three dimensions. Enhanced conceptual-analytical clarity of the elements constituting participation spaces provides a differentiated basis for discussing the transformative power of participatory knowledge production. By stimulating reflexivity on the making of participation, this approach contributes to better understanding when spaces of participation have the capacity to become spaces of transformation.

Reviewing a decade of scholarship for the field of transport	TRANSPORT REVIEWS			English	Review						Policy transfer; policy learning; sustainable mobility; transport; learning; critical drivers	GOVERNANCE; COMMUNITY; CAPACITY; LESSONS	Attempts to pursue sustainable mobility face widespread challenges. One key way of approaching these challenges is through policy transfer and policy learning; indeed, the practice of learning from elsewhere is encouraged at various levels of government. This paper contends that a better understanding of what facilitates learning through policy transfer might support further change, yet such examinations remain underdeveloped in the field of transport. This paper synthesises key concepts and factors that drive this learning process, by reviewing 65 papers on transport policy published between 2011 and 2020. Our findings testify to the growing prevalence of policy transfer research and emerging critical perspectives on the transfer and translation of global ideas. We uncover critical factors of the learning process, including settings where learning takes place, inter-actor relations, and organisational and institutional patterns. While most papers reviewed here aimed to examine learning, few employ theories to measure the concept. Consequently, one of our main conclusions is that relatively little is known about how and to what extent learning, triggered by experiences from other contexts, is actually transformed into action. Suggestions include more systematically focusing on organisational and institutional dimensions and concerted trans-disciplinary efforts to close the gap between research and practice.

We use three variables to measure the level of cooperation, namely number of joint CDM projects, volume of CO2 abatement realized from the CDM projects, and volume of investment in the CDM projects. We rely on international economics and international relations literature to suggest that the levels of economic development and institutional development, energy structures of the economies, country vulnerability to various climate change effects, political constraints, trade, and historic relations between the host and investor countries are good predictors of the level of cooperation in CDM projects. The main policy relevant conclusions include the importance of simplifying the CDM project regulation/clearance cycle as an essential policy option for further growth of joint CDM projects; improving governance structures in the host and investor countries that would lead to higher political stability and trust between the countries for business, including CDM; and strengthening trade or other long-term economic activities that connect the countries for fostering CDM cooperation.

An Ex-Post Analysis of Modal Shift in Four Cities	ENERGIES			English	Article						policy package; policy mix; car mobility; modal shift; sustainability; urban transition	ENERGY; CLIMATE; TRAVEL; INSTRUMENTS; FRAMEWORK; MOBILITY; GERMANY; LESSONS; CHOICE; MIX	Recently, there has been wider acknowledgement that sustainable urban mobility will not be triggered by one silver bullet' policy, or by piling up various policies, but requires a deliberate package of policies. Until recently, studies on policy instrument (or measure) interaction have been primarily ex-ante studies, estimating interactions in the future. However, from an evidence-based policy-making perspective, ex-ante evaluations need to use knowledge gained through ex-post evaluations, a crucial link in the policy cycle. To contribute to the strengthening of this poor link, this paper provides an ex-post analysis of instrument interaction in four northwest European, medium-sized cities: Bruges, Ghent, Jena & Erfurt. By exposing the relationships between the range of mobility policies implemented in relation to modal shift achieved, we offer insight into the crucial difference between piling up policies' and deliberate policy packages. As such, the paper offers evidence to inform ex-ante analysis for urban mobility policy-making and contributes to policy learning as part of effective governance.

The case study relies on documents and interviews to build the network and to investigate the structure of network relations. Results show that factors that govern the tourism policy implementation process reflect broader conditions that prevail within a decentralised elite-democracy context. Execution of the fiscal incentives policy is found to resemble pressure politics characterised by coalition building, government turfism and power relations, as opposing groups from other subsystems struggle to impose their own values. The effect is the non-implementation of policy. This implies that, in such a setting, tourism policy implementation should not be assumed to be a simple massing of assent or Weberian in nature. Rather, it should be thought of as having a political nature. The results pose some implications for tourism policy research and wider public policy process theory including the primacy of legal authority in a hierarchy of coalition resources.

To this end, this discussion will be developed at the global and local levels based on two different historical moments, although complementary. At the global level, we highlight the construction of the "Project for Environmental Protection and Sustainable Development of the Guarani Aquifer", between 2003 and 2009. At the local level, the mobilization (and non-mobilization) of the scientific discourse for the groundwater management in the municipality of Ribeirao Preto, located in the state of Sao Paulo-Brazil, and known for having aquifer outcrop zones in its territory. Thus, science must be understood as a recursive discourse mobilized by both scientists and other agents at different times in order to legitimize a position. From a theoretical perspective, this article mobilizes concepts from Pierre Bourdieu's sociology to study the construction of discourses on two scales and to understand the agents' positions in relation to the subjects discussed.

J	Arbab, P				Arbab, Parsa			City Prosperity Initiative Index: Using AHP Method to Recalculate the Weights of Dimensions and SubDimensions in Reference to Tehran Metropolis	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						City Prosperity Initiative (CPI) Index; Sustainability; Urban Prosperity; Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) Method; Tehran Metropolis		City Prosperity Initiative (CPI) as a comprehensive multidimensional index agreed globally, is a broad and flexible conceptual framework for measuring and monitoring the urbanization and urbanism as a consequence of this process. This initiative is a fundamental approach for defining an integrative and incremental vision and subsequently multi-sectorial and spatial analysis based direction for its fulfilment towards the sustainability path and sustainable urban development in different hierarchical levels and scales of global, national, regional, and local. The CPI is accompanied by a conceptual matrix, the Wheel of Urban Prosperity, in terms of six key components or dimensions associated with the city and urban settlement, including Productivity, Infrastructure Development, Quality of Life, Equity and Social Inclusion, Environmental Sustainability, and Urban Governance and Legislation. Each of these aspects includes 3 to 5 subdimensions defined and measured by a group of variables or indicators. Thus, the City Prosperity Initiative Index is essential basis to found and promote a new pattern or model of urbanization in the global scale which is adaptive to the contextual conditions and dynamics. Therefore, one of the most key issues in relation to the CPI Index is the weights of the dimensions and sub-dimensions in terms of the conceptualizations of a prosperous city based on the local priorities. Accordingly, this paper has been focused on the City Prosperity Initiative Index and subsequently recalculating the weights of its dimensions and sub-dimensions using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method according to the contextual situation of Tehran Metropolis in Iran.

On the relation between population density, land use and vegetation cover fractions in a city using a 30-years Landsat time series	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING			English	Article						Compact city; Dispersed green city; Remote sensing; Earth observation; Spectral unmixing; Berlin	URBAN FORM; COMPACT CITY; ENMAP DATA; SPACE; REGRESSION; CITIES; CHALLENGES; DYNAMICS; JUSTICE; IMPACT	Both compact and dispersed green cities are considered sustainable urban forms, yet some developments accompanied with these planning paradigms seem problematic in times of urban growth. A compact city might lose urban green spaces due to infill and a dispersed-green city might lose green in its outskirts through suburbanisation. To study these storylines, we introduce an operationalised concept of contrasting changes in population density (shrinkage or growth) with vegetation density (sealing or greening) over time. These trends are ascribed to different land use classes and single urban development projects, to quantify threads and pathways for urban green in a densifying city. We mapped the development in vegetation density over 30 years as subpixel fractions based on a Landsat remote sensing time series (for 2015: MAE 0.12). The case study city Berlin, Germany, developed into a city that is both gaining in vegetation-greening-and population-growing-in recent years but featured highly diverse trends for both compact and green city districts before that. Pathways to achieve a greening-growing scenario in a compact city include green roofs, brownfield and industrial revitalisation, and bioswales in predominantly green city districts. A threat for compact cities pose infill developments without greening measures. A threat for dispersed-green cities is microsealing in private residential gardens-gravel gardens-or car parking infrastructure. We conclude that neither a compact nor a dispersed-green city form concept logically leads to a development towards more environmental quality-here vegetation density-in times of densification but rather context specific urban planning.

Using case studies of Mount Elgon in Kenya and Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh it shows the importance of ethnicity based inequalities in defining sustainability outcomes. The paper explores, first, the mechanisms through which dominant ethnic groups are able to exert influence on resource management at the expense of less powerful groups; and second, the consequences of ethnic inequalities for resource uses within ostensibly democratic systems. It combines information from social and political history with remote sensing data to explore causes, processes and patterns behind spatial trends in the study of forests. The paper concludes that efficacy of national democracy and its institutions in achieving positive environmental outcomes depends on the power relations among social groups, particularly in historically contested contexts. Further, environmental and social dimensions of sustainability cannot be treated separately and the issue of equity among groups, ethnic or otherwise, needs to be recognised in policies for sustainable development. The study points out the need for further research into integrating socio-political history with spatial data to better understand social and spatial distribution of policy impacts.

First, it provides a comprehensive review of different approaches to analysing food security. Second, it highlights the added value provided by the capability approach and the human development paradigm. Third, it proposes a methodology to assess food security through this approach. Our proposal entails three basic steps: (1) analysis of food entitlements; (2) analysis of nutritional capabilities and (3) analysis of the capability to be food secure. In this way, we can move beyond income, entitlement or livelihood related frameworks, and identify the root causes of food insecurity. Food insecurity can be the result of a lack of education, health or other basic capabilities that constitute people's wellbeing. This, therefore, allows situating the study within the broader area of wellbeing and development. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

SUSTAINABLE GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT OF FOOD SYSTEMS: ETHICAL PERSPECTIVES			English	Proceedings Paper	15th Congress of the European-Society-for-Agricultural-and-Food-Ethics (EurSafe)	SEP 18-21, 2019	Tampere Univ, Tampere, FINLAND	European Soc Agr & Food Eth	Tampere Univ	animal welfare science; Brambell Committee; actor-network-theory		Since the Brambell Committee formulated the Five Freedoms, animal welfare received considerable attention in science and society. Animal welfare developed into an independent, but interdisciplinary science that combines natural and life sciences with philosophical assumptions. This development into an academic discipline has been influenced by non-scientific factors such as governmental laws and regulations and the ongoing public debates on animal welfare. A better understanding of the dynamic relation between scientific disciplines and the governmental and public dimensions can give us relevant information about the development of animal welfare science and changes in the human-animal relationship. However, due to its complexity, it is not easy to get grip on this development. In this paper, we aim to approach this challenge to get more grip on the development of animal welfare science by exploring whether the application of the Actor-Network-Theory can help. For this step, we have three arguments. First, Actor-Network-Theory (ANT) provides a frame that enables us to deal with the interaction between humans and animals. The ANT recognizes the distinction between 'human actors' and 'non-human actants', but allows to include animals in the theory. Second, the ANT provides a frame to analyse the complexity and dynamics of animal welfare science, for instance by relating it to developments in science and society. Third, ANT addresses science from a scope that includes social dimensions that seem relevant in the case of animal welfare science. The hypothesis is that elaborating these three aspects can contribute to a better understanding of the development of animal welfare science.	[Guo, X.; Meijboom, F. L.

We review these findings in relation to: an environmentally sustainable level of water diversions, as mandated in the Australian Water Act 2007; Sovereign Indigenous water rights and interests; the economics of water recovery to increase stream and river flows; and water governance. After reviewing the independent findings and the responses by government agencies, we propose the following actions to respond to post-truth: (1) instituting greater transparency in measurements of water use, consumption, storage and return flows and also of water values (market and non-market); (2) using deliberative democracy, engaging in more effective and inclusive participation in decision-making in terms of water planning and allocations, especially of those who have been long excluded such as the First Peoples of Australia; and (3) giving primacy to the environmental goals of the Water Act 2007 and supporting this through the establishment of an independent standing commission which reports to the Australian parliament and has audit and oversight powers in relation to land, water and the environment.

Evolving water science in the Anthropocene	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							FED AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS; NGIRO RIVER-BASIN; LAND-USE CHANGES; CONSERVATION TILLAGE; MAKANYA CATCHMENT; SMALLHOLDER FARMERS; GLOBAL CHANGE; ECONOMIC GOOD; MANAGEMENT; IMPACTS	This paper reviews the changing relation between human beings and water since the Industrial Revolution, a period that has been called the Anthropocene because of the unprecedented scale at which humans have altered the planet during this time. We show how the rapidly changing world urges us to continuously improve our understanding of the complex interactions between humans and the water system. The paper starts by demonstrating that hydrology and the science of managing water resources have played key roles in human and economic development throughout history; yet these roles have often been marginalised or obscured. Knowledge of hydrology and water resources engineering and management helped to transform the landscape, and thus also the very hydrology within catchments itself. It is only fairly recent that water experts have become conscious of such mechanisms, exemplified by several concepts that try to incorporate them-integrated water resources management, eco-hydrology, socio-hydrology. We have reached a stage at which a more systemic understanding of scale interdependencies can inform the sustainable governance of water systems, using new concepts like precipitation sheds, virtual water transfers, water footprints, and water value flow.

J	Frantzeskaki, N; McPhearson, T; Kabisch, N				Frantzeskaki, Niki; McPhearson, Timon; Kabisch, Nadja			Urban sustainability science: prospects for innovations through a system's perspective, relational and transformations' approaches This article belongs to Ambio's 50th Anniversary Collection. Theme: Urbanization	AMBIO			English	Article						Cities; Nature-based solutions; Place; Sustainability; Systems; Transitions; Transformations		In this perspective, we present how three initial landmark papers on urban sustainability research contributed to the larger sustainability science scholarship and paved the way for the continued development of urban sustainability research. Based on this, we propose three conceptual innovation pathways to trace the progression of urban sustainability science: First, urban sustainability from a system's perspective, meaning that urban sustainability requires integrative solutions to work in the tripled social-ecological-technological system setting. Second, urban sustainability from a (people and place) relational perspective, meaning urban sustainability is a contested and dynamic social-ecological contract of cities. As a governance mission, urban sustainability requires evidence from research that can inform coordinated action to bridge people, places, meanings, visions and ecosystems. Third, urban sustainability from a transformative science perspective, meaning that for urban sustainability to be achieved and progressed, deep transformations are required in systems, relations, policies and governance approaches. Our proposal for the future of urban sustainability science centres on emphasizing the relevance and policy applicability of systems' thinking, value and place thinking and transitions/transformations thinking as fundamental to how knowledge is co-produced by research science, policy and society and becomes actionable.

J	Perez, FR; Vina, M				Represa Perez, Fernando; Vina, Michael			From below and from within: fishing communities under the COVID-19 pandemic and other globalizations in southern Manabi, Ecuador	TERRITORY POLITICS GOVERNANCE			English	Article						globalization; fisheries; pluriverse; COVID-19; adaptation; marine governance	POLITICAL ECOLOGY; ADAPTATION; FISHERIES	Within the many fishing communities that dot the southern coast of Manabi province, Ecuador, everyday realities are more diverse and uneven than those suggested by the romantic images circulating in the global media. This article zooms in on a maritime-fishing territory located in the Puerto Lopez canton to illustrate the challenges posed by globalization processes at different scales. Drawing on Ribeiro's concept of globalizations from below, this work analyses the ambiguous relations between artisanal and industrial fishing sectors, marine conservation and fishers' livelihoods, and the unmitigated spread of COVID-19. The article argues that fishers' adaptive strategies do not exclusively articulate with a changing environment but are also pragmatic responses to the long-term effects of several types of socioeconomic developments that have shifted the meanings of the seascape. The study concludes that fishers' adaptive strategies to grapple with institutional and economic volatility must be understood as non-linear and emergent processes that simultaneously shift between the centre and the marginal borders of the globalized economic system. This article is based on ethnographic research, semi-structured interviews and focus groups carried out between 2014 and 2020.

J	Mandrup, T				Mandrup, Thomas			An uncertain future: South Africa's national defence force caught between foreign-policy ambitions and domestic development	JOURNAL OF EASTERN AFRICAN STUDIES			English	Article						SANDF; MONUC; MONUSCO; Central African Republic; South Africa; democratic Republic of Congo; defence; foreign policy		In June 2015, the South African Parliament passed the long-awaited defence review (DR2015). The aim of the review was to stop the decline of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) and to create an economical and sustainable force structure capable of continuing to fulfil its constitutional obligations and to support the country's foreign policy, primarily in relation to Africa. However, implementation of the DR2015 has turned out to be difficult. The major claim of this article is that the processes of demilitarisation and transition since the end of apartheid, combined with years of underfunding and the lack of a priority given to the SANDF has reduced the latter's professional military capabilities to such an extent that in the future it will find it difficult to function in the active international role it has played since the end of the 1990s.

Using a theoretical approach, the UGI's specific contribution to WB is calculated as the sum of the products of (a) the number of perceived ES per ES group and the WB weight factor divided by the product of (b) the number of respondents and (c) the sum of the products of ES and the WB weight factor. Stakeholders demand more ES than the perceived ES supply from all types of UGI, especially for the social relations component of WB. The highest number of perceived ES and greatest impact on all WB components is provided by urban forests. This method could be helpful in acknowledging ES and involving stakeholders not previously familiar with the ES concept with the aim of introducing ES into UGI governance.

The transition motif has also been taken up by local and grassroots actors and initiatives trying to converge in a cohesive society project. These two strands of transitions, one institutional, directed in a 'top-down' manner, and another, a grassroots or 'bottom-up' sort, question the potential for a dialogue to emerge between these two dynamics and their respective actors. This chapter draws on the case of Montreuil, the fourth most populous suburb of Paris, involved in a transition management process from 2011 to 2014 as part of the elaboration of its Local Climate Plan. Based on a 2-years' participant observation within the project team, the aim is to describe the adaptation of transition management to the French political context and to explore the possibility of 'hybridisations' between 'regime' and 'niche' actors-between their roles, relations, and cultures.

The Institutional Status of the BRICS and Pragmatic Cooperation: The Case of South America	VESTNIK MEZHDUNARODNYKH ORGANIZATSII-INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS RESEARCH JOURNAL			English	Article						BRICS; pragmatic cooperation; emerging powers; New Development Bank; South America	GLOBAL GOVERNANCE; MULTILATERALISM	BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), a group of emerging powers, is a pragmatic political group in which members are not always in agreement. Internal cooperation in BRICS evolved, becoming more "institutional" with the creation of its financial institutions, the New Development Bank (NDB) and the Contingency Reserve Agreement (CRA), which have led the group to the next stage in its development without changing its essence. The NDB was created to mobilize resources for infrastructure and sustainable development projects in emerging and developing countries, and the CRA to provide liquidity to countries that face balance of payments difficulties and to future economic crises. Many developing countries are keenly observing these financial institutions. A number of South American countries appear particularly interested in these financial institutions, and would like to attract investments and obtain loans from BRICS to develop the infrastructures of their countries, and to build informal relationships with foreign partners, but without the same level of political commitments as those between BRICS members. South American countries see BRICS as an example of pragmatic cooperation that is different to the modus operandi of traditional powers, and its financial institutions as an alternative to the International Monetary Fund and World Bank for financial aid. The relations between BRICS and South America are characterized by a pragmatic approach reflecting the ethos of the group and the necessity for modernization in South America. This article analyzes the particular relationship that BRICS is establishing with South American countries, using its institutional status and pragmatic approach.	[Contipelli, E.

Many CE practitioners consider the first international CE agreement between China and the EU a milestone towards such an effort. This analysis shows why this expectation is premature. European and Chinese stakeholders' optimistic and depoliticized CE narratives disable communication regarding development disparities, negative competition and distrust, which shape geopolitical rivalry. While skeptical narratives that address political barriers exist, they fall short of suggesting alternatives. Based on 72 stakeholder interviews, 40 documents and participant observation, these results highlight the critical importance of investigating narrative strategies to repoliticize environmental cooperation. Such narrative strategies would support contestation and negotiation on development disparities and open channels for joint conceptualization of implementation scales for environmental strategies, circular or otherwise. We therefore propose using constructivist perspectives of international relations to explore discursive barriers and enablers to global environmental action.

J	Hansen-Magnusson, H				Hansen-Magnusson, Hannes			The web of responsibility in and for the Arctic	CAMBRIDGE REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS			English	Article							ACCOUNTABILITY; POWER; OIL; POLITICS; AGENCY; LIMITS	What does it mean to be responsible in and for the Arctic? This article addresses this question, noting that responsibility has become a core policy norm in different governance areas in recent decades. The article contributes to the current debate on responsibility in global politics, arguing that one should consider not only who is responsible (and what for) but also the capability foundations upon which responsibility is exercised, as well as the underlying normativity of this practice. Instead of only focusing on capabilities as first principles from which responsibilities arise, this article suggests approaching responsibility as a web of relations. On the basis of this theoretical discussion the article turns to two cases of contemporary Arctic policy where we can observe responsibility 'at work'. The fields of search and rescue and sustainable development are both marked by a cooperative approach among (state and non-state) parties, whose interactions centre on a particular ethical understanding of responsibility rather than on power-oriented politics. Yet each policy field contains specific dilemmas, as Arctic governance is characterised by a web of responsibility that comprises multiple subjects in charge and/or objects for which they are responsible.

J	Beisbart, C				Beisbart, Claus			Do we need an ethics of planetary sustainability?	GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Communication and education; human behaviour; policies; politics and governance		The politics of the United Nations aims at sustainable development (i.e., development that can continue with future generations). Andreas Losch has recently proposed to expand our current notion of sustainability to what he calls `planetary sustainability', and he has urged an ethics of planetary sustainability. This comment article discusses these proposals. The proposed conceptual change is assessed, drawing on desiderata suggested by Carnap. To the extent to which the current notion of sustainability has excluded consideration of outer space, we gain in simplicity. To the extent to which it has been unclear about this issue, we gain in exactness. The proposed concept is fruitful because it points to important considerations, in particular if there are extraterrestrial beings that share moral status with human beings. But to some extent this fruitfulness requires a clear deviation from the anthropocentric outlook of our current notion of sustainability, and costs regarding similarity arise. As far as an ethics of sustainability is concerned, we certainly need to address ethical issues that arise in relation to outer space. However, the notion of planetary sustainability is not likely to figure prominently in related thoughts because the notion of sustainability is not a key concept in known ethical theories.

The transformations often involve conflicts and also new governance arrangements between different knowledge regimes, local practices and national and global frameworks of climate mitigation, water resources management and the green economy. Significantly, they also entail varying expectations concerning the meaning of water and the political promises of technology in advancing more sustainable futures. Drawing on sociological science and technology studies, particularly the sociology of expectations, this article analyses competing, parallel and confronting expectations regarding water and technology that different actors produce, negotiate and contest in the context of the recently launched 1500 MW hydropower megaproject Coca Codo Sinclair in Ecuador. It takes expectations as performative as they may shape and challenge policies, discourses, social interactions, institutions and power relations. By analysing and comparing these expectations, the article scrutinises the socio-technical imaginaries and related knowledge regimes they represent, derive from and support, and what kinds of repercussions these have in terms of water resources management in particular and sustainability governance in general.

J	Rodenbiker, J				Rodenbiker, Jesse			Making Ecology Developmental: China's Environmental Sciences and Green Modernization in Global Context	ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS			English	Article						China; ecological civilization; ecology; modernization; science and technology studies		Although the science of ecology is often understood in antimodernizing terms, this article shows how ecology in China has become a means to articulate green modernization and sustainable development. As scholars predominantly focus on the policy rhetoric surrounding China's national modernization and sustainable development program called "ecological civilization building," the origins of how ecology came to take on developmental meanings remain obscure. This article highlights moments of global exchange and knowledge production by Chinese Marxists, earth systems scientists, and economists that produced eco-developmental logics. These logics define an interventionist role for the state, frame urbanization as moral progress, and refashion the role of the peasantry from the revolutionary vanguard to a backward social force impeding modernization. Ecological sciences in China, therefore, lay an epistemological foundation for legitimizing state-led technocratic practices of socioenvironmental engineering and naturalizing social inequalities between "urban" and "rural" people. In highlighting Chinese scientists' agency in producing knowledge, this article counters diffusionist accounts of science as singular systematically organized branches of knowledge that emanate from the West. Instead, I demonstrate how ecology is contingent on the historical and political conditions through which it takes on meaning. In the context of China, ecology has become integral to environmental governance, state formation, and uneven relations of power.

There is a growing literature that explicitly focuses on studies that reveal the existence of an extremely rich variety of systems of management of common-pool resources. In relation to natural resources, the term management can be understood as the "right to regulate internal use patterns and transform the resource by making improvement's" Partnerships between local communes are vital in the quest for integrated sustainable development and conservation. Since 2004, when Poland acquired the status of a European Union Member State, local authorities in Poland have shown an increased interest in voluntary environmental commitments in order to decrease the negative environmental impacts caused by their organizations and activities, and to further the process of sustainable development. Good governance is a prerequisite for effective management, and is fundamental to securing the political and community support essentials to the development indeed the survival of the global protected area system. Without support from management of the local communes, it is difficult to integrate environmental issues into landscapes parks and other protected areas. Activities of associations of communes and other environmental organizations aim at reaching a compromise between competitive interests of the economy and the needs of ecosystems, which is important from the point of view of eliminating potential human being-environment conflicts.

Landholders' perceptions on legal reserves and agricultural intensification: Diversity and implications for forest conservation in the eastern Brazilian Amazon	FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Legal Reserve; Farmer perceptions; Forest conservation; Forest protection; Agricultural intensification; Q methodology; Brazilian Amazon	LAND CONFLICT; SAO-FELIX; DEFORESTATION; BIODIVERSITY; GOVERNANCE; FRONTIER; SYSTEMS; VALUES; STATE; NEEDS	Forest conservation on privately owned lands is a cornerstone of the Brazilian environmental policy framework. Brazilian legislation requires that all farms in the country maintain and protect forest areas known as Legal Reserves. Since Legal Reserves have major implications for forest conservation and agricultural production, it is key that we understand landholders' perceptions towards Legal Reserves. We applied Q methodology to identify different perspectives of medium and large landholders on Legal Reserves and their relation to agricultural intensification in the municipality of Paragominas, eastern Amazon. We conducted 31 interviews in which landholders sorted 36 statements in a quasi-normal distribution array. Three groups of landholders were identified: 1) Land use planning enthusiasts (n = 16) were interested in zoning initiatives to explore alternative landscape designs and legislation that may deliver better conservation and production outcomes; 2) Agrochemical-based agriculture supporters (n = 7) held the most critical views against Legal Reserves and perceived their costs as higher than the potential environmental and life quality benefits; 3) Policy complacentmarket responders (n = 4) showed no interest in Legal Reserves reforms and were the most market driven group.. While Paragominas has achieved notable successes in halting large-scale deforestation through a social "Green Municipality" pact, addressing persisting forest degradation and fragmentation in the region remains a key priority. Local governance initiatives that account for multi-stakeholder perceptions on forest conservation can foster dialogue and mutual understanding to effectively conserve and restore Legal Reserves.

Failure to meet these demands imposes costs on firms and workers, stifles expansion, and potentially compromises the long-run economic competitiveness of the growth area. Drawing on evidence from Germany (Munich), Sweden (Stockholm), and the UK (Cambridge) this paper examines the organisational and political challenges of growth facilitation in the context of post-Keynesian political and economic restructuring. Particular emphasis is placed on tensions arising from changes in the form and function of European state social regulation. These tensions are not simply a matter of neoliberal regulatory deficit but reflect broader societal cleavages in relation to the uneven spatial impact of local economic growth. Deploying the concept of territorial structures of growth facilitation provides a conceptual framework for taking forward research on the relationship between state spatial regulation, state restructuring, and the competitiveness of city-regions.

J	Cuadrado-Quesada, G				Cuadrado-Quesada, Gabriela			Realising the Human Right to Water in Costa Rica through Social Movements	UTRECHT LAW REVIEW			English	Article						social movements; right to water; Costa Rica; social organisation; pineapple monoculture		This article examines human rights from the perspective of social constructions and as the result of historical processes. This means that human rights, as we know them today, are the result of dynamic and historical struggles. This is no different with regard to the human right to water. In particular, this article addresses the following research question: how interwoven are social movements with the realisation of the human right to water? While answering this question the article brings to the discussion some relations between the human right to water and the idea of sustainable development. This article focuses on Costa Rica because it is a country that has long been celebrated as a leader in sustainable development, environmental policy, and protection of natural resources. Recently, however, Costa Rica became the world's number one exporter of pineapple. The shocking growth of pineapple plantations in recent years has caused innumerable socio-environmental problems including that of water pollution. The article concludes that demanding the realisation of the human right to water through social struggles, and especially through social organisation and pressuring the government, is the way forward to accomplish this right and the ultimate goal of sustainable development.

This article looks at the challenges of conserving marine biocultural diversity by investigating the unique heritage of marine salmon fisheries through a case study of a small group of marine fisheries in Norway, still fishing for Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L. Tight relationships between declining natural resources and daily struggles to keep cultural heritage alive are highlighted through theoretical perspectives of social identity and local ecological knowledge. The theoretical lens of social identity contributes to better understanding tensions between scientific and local knowledge by bringing forward social categorisation, polarisation and power relations as drivers of conflicts. Involvement of local communities and respect for their cultural heritage, knowledge and practices can assist in more effective management and governance of multifunctional biocultural landscapes, and contribute to their resilience and adaptability.

We draw attention in particular to global commodity chains as relational processes not only of trade and investment, but also geopolitics and aid, to argue that these transborder processes have connected together commons in distant localities resulting in their simultaneous enclosure, dispossession and (re-)commoning with implications for community vulnerabilities in positive and negative ways. To demonstrate this argument we analyse three periods of EAEI: the late nineteenth century until World War II, when Japan and Thailand both began to modernise and new trade and geopolitical relations emerged in the context of colonialism; the post-World War II recovery until the Plaza Accord in 1986, during which time Japan rapidly industrialised, as did Thailand to a lesser extent and regionalism was largely defined by US hegemony; and the post-Plaza Accord period, when Japan deindustrialised its labour intensive manufacture and heavy industry and Thailand rapidly industrialised and EAEI became defined by new and intensified global commodity chains.

To achieve this goal, general scientific and special scientific methods of cognition were used, in particular, dialectical, logical-formal, analysis and synthesis, structural-systemic, legal-comparative, legal-formal, prognostic. The study emphasizes that the lack of approved strategic documents for the development of the forestry sector prevents the formation of a projected public policy and, therefore, creates an unresolved organizational and legal structure of governance in forestry relations in general and reduces the effectiveness of fire safety in forests. It is concluded that among the priorities for achieving the task of effective fire safety in forests are identified factors that are primarily the formation of a single interagency consensus vision of the development of the forestry sector, reflected in the Strategy for Sustainable Development of Forest Resources and, consequently, a system of rules and principles basis of the national forest policy.

J	Essletzbichler, J				Essletzbichler, Juergen			Engaging with precarious urban futures: From entrepreneurial to grounded cities	EUROPEAN URBAN AND REGIONAL STUDIES			English	Article						Foundational economy; grounded city; precariousness; social-ecological transformation; sociospatial reliance systems	EMISSIONS; VIENNA; INCOME	In order to answer the question posed by the conference Urban Europe, Precarious Futures? the article examines the relationship between rising precariousness,the need for social-ecological transformation to keep socio-ecological environments manageable for future generations of Europeans and the provision of urban reliance systems as the key pillar of a possible transformation toward life within the planetary boundaries. The article has four goals: First, it establishes a link between the literatures on precarization, three possible political-economic development scenarios, and resulting modes of urban governance. Second, it develops the normative but theoretically and empirically backed claim that a strengthening of the foundational economy appears most suited to produce the necessary reductions in precarious living conditions and environmental destruction required for a socially and ecologically sustainable future. Third, the urban scale is argued to occupy a privileged position as a growing site of human habitation in Europe and for the design and provision of foundational infrastructure and universal basic services. The article links cities to the foundational economy via the concept of the Grounded City. Fourth, research on the provision of universal basic services in the City of Vienna is employed to illustrate that a narrow focus on cities as territorial-administrative containers ignoring their inter-territorial and inter-scalar relations is likely to produce socio-spatial rebound effects that may neutralize the gains of social-ecological investment in cities. Any effective social-ecological transformation thus requires coordination, cooperation, lobbying and political change at all scales of governance. In the European case, it requires the European Union to evolve from an economic to a social-ecological Union and for urban governance regimes across Europe to be altered to take into account the horizontal and intra-scalar relations that co-constitute cities.

Global food chains are often perceived to be less sustainable than local food chains. Yet, thorough food chain analyses and comparisons of different food chains across sustainability dimensions are rare. In this article we analyze the local Belgian and global Peruvian asparagus value chains and explore their sustainability performance. A range of indicators linked to environmental, economic and social impacts is calculated to analyze the contribution of the supply chains to economic development, resource use, labor relations, distribution of added value and governance issues. Our findings suggest that none of the two supply chains performs invariably better and that there are trade-offs among and between sustainability dimensions. Whereas the global chain uses water and other inputs more intensively and generates more employment per unit of land and higher yields, the local chain generates more revenue per unit of land.

In earlier days the environmental impacts due to these solutions were limited-although not always locally or even regionally negligible as the example of hunting of big animals illustrates. Closer to our times the character of the solutions, their systemic connections and the global width of application has drastically changed the situation. Today it is not only the "classical" industrial manufacture of products that have environmental repercussions, but the entire support system for daily life which includes a global connectivity of food provisions and new kinds of energy solutions as examples. These illustrate the integrated cross sectorial nature of the challenge due to their character, intensity and global embrace. Indeed, humans have during the latest generation taken over as the prime driving force with regard to global environmental impacts. And the character of the transformation is accelerating. Thus we are quickly moving into a new historical era-sometimes called the Anthropocene. This confronts us with issues about the relation between actions at different scales-including challenges regarding the material base for society and its natural environmental embedding. This has been referred to-in risk handling terms at global level-to a concern for living within a safe space set by "planetary boundaries". The interplay between the global macro level and other levels, not least with regard to governance and responsibility considerations, i.e. "stewardship", is at the core of our current societal situation. Systems and resilience considerations are now coming into the forefront when approaching this key "grand challenge". But also the societal distributional aspects increase in importance. The basis of our knowledge production and handling in connection to the expressed and used value systems are here of central importance when we have to face what stewardship at different scale levels from micro to macro might entail.

A systematic map	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL			English	Review						Biodiversity conservation; Marine Reserve; Marine Protected Area; Poverty; Human development; Livelihood	BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; FISHERIES MANAGEMENT; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; PROTECTED AREAS; SUSTAINABILITY; IMPACT; PHILIPPINES; GOVERNANCE; FRAMEWORK; PROJECTS	Background: Conservation activities and natural resource management interventions have often aimed to tackle the dual challenge of improving nature conservation and human well-being. However, there is concern over the extent to which this dual goal has been achieved, and an increasing recognition of trade-offs and synergies within and between aspects of each of the goals. The amount and scope of the available evidence on the success of conservation and management interventions in both arenas has lacked documentation, for a number of reasons, including limited resources for monitoring and evaluation and the difficulty in bringing together a disparate evidence base. This systematic map focuses on the interaction between marine conservation management and the health and well-being of coastal communities in South East Asia. Method: We searched bibliographic databases to find published literature, and identified grey literature through institutional and organisational website searches and key stakeholders. Eligibility criteria were applied in two stages, title and abstract and full text, with consistency checks. We extracted meta -data on the design and characteristics of each study, from which we produced an interactive database and map, and a narrative summary. Results: We assessed 42,894 records at title and abstract from the main searches. 1,331 articles were assessed at full text (30 articles were not retrievable). 287 articles (281 studies) were included in the systematic map. Most studies were peer-reviewed publications (90%), and from the Philippines and Indonesia (72%). 31% of studies were solely qualitative, 45% were solely quantitative and 24% included both qualitative and quantitative research. Only 24% (31/127) of quantitative studies included a comparator. We identified knowledge clusters where studies investigated the links between the marine conservation interventions: Site Protection, Economic or Livelihood Incentives or Alternatives, or Habitat Management, and the human health and well-being outcomes: Economic Living Standards, Governance and Empowerment, or Social Relations. In addition, qualitative research clusters were identified exploring the links between the intervention Habitat Management, and the outcome Governance and Empowerment, and between the intervention Economic or Livelihood Incentives or Alternatives, and the outcomes of Governance and Empowerment, and Social Relations. We identified major knowledge gaps in evidence for the effect of marine conservation interventions on the outcomes Freedom of Choice and Action, Security and Safety, Subjective Well-being, Health, and Culture and Spirituality. There was a lack of studies involving Education, Awareness and Activism interventions that reported any human health and well-being outcomes. Conclusion: We present the first updatable, interrogable and comprehensive evidence map on this topic for South East Asia. Our work supports further, detailed investigation of knowledge clusters using systematic review and also serves to identify understudied topic areas. The lack of comparative, quantitative studies suggests that future research should include counterfactuals to strengthen the robustness of evidence base. Users of this systematic map should recognise that much evidence may be national or locally specific, and that we did not undertake an assessment of study quality. Thus, when considering implications for policy and decision-making, users should carefully consider the heterogeneity of available evidence and refer to original research articles to gain a full depth of understanding and context.
