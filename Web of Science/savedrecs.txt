URBAN POLICY AND RESEARCH			English	Article						Finance; decarbonisation; governance; urban political ecology; cities; local government; Melbourne	CLIMATE-CHANGE; ENERGY; GOVERNANCE; CITIES; TRANSITIONS; POLITICS; CHALLENGES; INNOVATION; INSIGHTS; PROJECTS	As decarbonisation interventions proliferate within cities, local governments setting ambitious targets are increasingly engaged in complex financial relations. Recognising the necessary cost of renewable and energy efficient infrastructures, and the ever-present constraints on public funds, this paper argues that finance is a critical node through which local governments advance decarbonisation in urban localities. While local decarbonisation strategies have been viewed cautiously for their potential to overburden individuals at the expense of more systematic and organisational change, this paper reveals a more complex picture. Drawing on decarbonisation initiatives in two Melbourne municipalities-Moreland and Darebin-it identifies four ways in which local governments are using public finance to achieve their sustainability objectives. Local governments are brokering bulk product purchases for residents; lending upfront capital for solar PV via local property taxes; purchasing energy efficient products and funding innovative technology pilots; and procuring renewable energy supply through multi-stakeholder power purchase agreements. By targeting lower income households and pooling resources with other organisations, the paper shows that local governments can address socio-economic inequality and facilitate extra-local change towards a low-carbon city. However, these incremental achievements emphasise the need for co-ordination and state engagement to realise decarbonisation at a meaningful scale.

While state-owned power companies (SPCs) are the dominant firm type in the global electricity sector, representing nearly two thirds of global electric power generation capacity, most climate policy literature focuses on private sector companies when analyzing decarbonization interventions. SPCs' distinct corporate governance structures, objectives, relationships with government, and sources of finance, however, can be markedly different from those of private companies. Here, we develop a framework for analyzing the extent to which common and divergent features of SPCs, and the markets in which they operate, affect their relationship to government interventions on decarbonization. We also consider the implications of these relationships for the effective implementation of sector-wide decarbonization strategies. We then apply this framework using a comparative case study analysis of six major SPCs, and highlight how differences in their agency, motivation, capacity, and market exposure may result in different potential responsiveness to government regulatory, policy and market interventions on decarbonization. We generalize these findings by developing four SPC archetypes and illustrate how they might respond differently to government interventions targeting decarbonization. Our analysis posits that SPCs can, under the guidance of governments pursuing ambitious climate policy, be more effective vehicles for decarbonization relative to private sector companies, particularly when they operate with a high degree of operational independence, are insulated from competitive pressures, and have the financial and technical capacity to invest in the decarbonization of their asset base. Similarly, market-wide policy interventions, such as carbon pricing mechanisms, could in practice be less effective interventions with respect to SPCs than their private counterparts when the SPC is ill-equipped to translate these incentives into decarbonization action because it is mandated to pursue supplementary objectives other than profit maximization alone. Ultimately, governments will need to step up their climate action to achieve carbon neutrality. SPCs can, and where they are major market players, must be key actors in driving decarbonization when the appropriate interventions are utilized and therefore deserve significantly more attention in the climate policy debate.

In the nationally orientated climate policy framework codified under the Paris Agreement, each nation must decide the scale and method of their emissions reduction contribution while remaining consistent with the global carbon budget. This policy process will require engagement amongst a wide range of stakeholders who have very different visions for the physical implementation of deep decarbonization. The Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project (DDPP) has developed a methodology, building on the energy, climate and economics literature, to structure these debates based on the following principles: country-scale analysis to capture specific physical, economic and political circumstances to maximize policy relevance, a long-term perspective to harmonize short-term decisions with the long-term objective and detailed sectoral analysis with transparent representation of emissions drivers through a common accounting framework or 'dashboard'. These principles are operationalized in the creation of deep decarbonization pathways (DDPs), which involve technically detailed, sector-by-sector maps of each country's decarbonization transition, backcasting feasible pathways from 2050 end points. This article shows how the sixteen DDPP country teams, covering 74% of global energy system emissions, used this method to collectively restrain emissions to a level consistent with the 2 degrees C target while maintaining development aspirations and reflecting national circumstances, mainly through efficiency, decarbonization of energy carriers (e.g. electricity, hydrogen, biofuels and synthetic gas) and switching to these carriers. The cross-cutting analysis of country scenarios reveals important enabling conditions for the transformation, pertaining to technology research and development, investment, trade and global and national policies. Policy relevance In the nation-focused global climate policy framework codified in the Paris Agreement, the purpose of the DDPP and DDPs is to provide a common method by which global and national governments, business, civil society and researchers in each country can communicate, compare and debate differing concrete visions for deep decarbonization in order to underpin the necessary societal and political consensus to design and implement short-term policy packages that are consistent with long-term global decarbonization.

The purpose of this research was to analyse the rates of change taking place in the energy systems of the European Union (EU), in the light of the EU's climate change mitigation objectives. Trends on indicators such as energy intensity and carbon intensity of energy were compared with decadal benchmarks derived from deep decarbonisation scenarios for the electricity, residential, transport, and industry sectors. The methodology applied provides a useful and informative approach to tracking decarbonisation of energy systems. The results show that the EU has made significant progress in decarbonising its energy systems. On a number of indicators assessed the results show that a significant acceleration from historical levels is required in order to reach the rates of change seen on the future benchmarks for deep decarbonisation. The methodology applied provides an example of how the research community and international organisations could complement the transparency mechanism developed by the Paris Agreement on climate change, to improve understanding of progress toward low-carbon energy systems.

J	Linton, S; Clarke, A; Tozer, L				Linton, Samantha; Clarke, Amelia; Tozer, Laura			Technical pathways to deep decarbonization in cities: Eight best practice case studies of transformational climate mitigation	ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Cities; Climate change; Deep decarbonization; Pathways; Energy; Transportation	WASTE MANAGEMENT; PLANS; CITY; POLITICS; SYSTEMS; IMPACT; SCALE	As the urgency for climate action heightens, local governments and stakeholders are developing pathways towards deep decarbonization at the local level and committing to community-wide greenhouse gas reductions of 80-100% by 2050 or earlier. Urban areas are the largest place-based source of greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for 71%-76% of global emissions. Local governments have direct and indirect control of over a significant proportion of emissions that occur within their municipalities. However, there remains a gap in knowledge about the local technical and policy pathways that are being developed in order to achieve deep decarbonization and how these pathways vary for different size cities. This study qualitatively analyzes eight local government deep decarbonization plans of cities that range in size from eight thousand to nine million people. We analyze emerging patterns among the cities, while also considering the impacts of the population size and the national context. Each city has unique circumstances and priorities when it comes to decarbonization, and not all cities prioritize their highest emitting sectors for decarbonization. We find that emerging technical pathways to deep decarbonization focus on five priority sectors (electricity, buildings, transportation, waste, and carbon sinks and storage), but also that several local governments are developing innovative strategies beyond what is described in the literature for decarbonizing the priority sectors within their jurisdiction and are expanding the scope of their plans to include emerging areas in GHG mitigation such as scope 3 and embodied greenhouse gas emissions.

It complements our previous work in [1] which stressed the economic effectiveness and CO2 emission reductions. Based on the results of these two works, here we analyze the trade-offs of the energy-environmental-economic (3E) objectives of the pathways. We find that although CCS technology can help achieve a cost effective and a high degree of CO2 emission abatement, it results in an additional coal consumption and cost disadvantages of RES power. Accordingly, if China heavily relies on CCS technology to achieve power decarbonization, the long-term energy sustainability is undermined. The challenges for policy makers are therefore to design comprehensive packages which are mutually reinforcing or at least compatible with acceptable costs in achieving the 3E objectives for the power decarbonization. With an empirical review of the past policy designs, we also find that China favors energy sustainability, yet neglecting the economic effectiveness and CO2 emissions. The institutional environment including the government's attitudes towards climate change, the development of ETS market and the reforms on electricity price, will largely influence the deployment of low-carbon technologies and thus the pathways of power decarbonization.

To limit global warming, many nations, including Switzerland, have committed to a (near) net-zero emission industry target by 2050. While the policy relevance of an industry transition increases, specific knowledge on the key barriers and drivers towards industrial decarbonisation is still largely missing. With the objective to contribute to the decision basis for effective policy development and based on 17 semi-structured interviews with firms from the Swiss industry, we investigate the key factors that hinder or accelerate a timely adoption of decarbonisation technologies. We relate the identified barriers and drivers from our interviews to an adapted St. Gallen Management Model (SGMM), a well-known, system-oriented management framework. Our study shows that the SGMM categories technology & economy (e.g. high technology costs), state & policymakers (e.g. emission price) and finance & controlling (e.g. payback periods) are most frequently mentioned by the interviewees and that the firms' decarbonisation decisions are influenced by both the firm itself as well as external stakeholders, such as the government, consultants, customers, NGOs or suppliers. Therefore, we conclude that the firm itself and each of these stakeholders must play a key part in fostering industry decarbonisation. We suggest future research to (1) quantitatively assess the importance of the identified barriers and drivers and (2) investigate how policy actions of the relevant stakeholders could be effectively orchestrated and incentivised.

The political challenge is to use dedicated funds and grants to move from the energy market to low-carbon technology. For sustainable development, governments must implement an environmentally friendly, cost-effective, and socially acceptable policy. The risk of social acceptance plays a vital role in Poland, especially in Silesia, influencing the decarbonization process. The study's main objective was to identify socio-economic features that affect the assessment of the decarbonization process in Poland, assuming that respondents used central or local funds to carry out this process. The authors deepened the multidisciplinary aspect of the analysis of decarbonization, mainly pointing to social issues, which was presented in the article. The study was conducted using the "snowball" method on a group of 444 socially diverse people. They were based on non-parametric statistical methods: Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U, and the Kruskal-Wallis test, which showed that the most effective factors in the decarbonization process are subsidies used by local governments. Moreover, it was found that people with higher education give less support to the centralization of funds for decarbonization, though they perceive that local funds provide a greater chance of success for decarbonization processes. This study fills the gap in social sciences.

J	Joskow, PL				Joskow, Paul L.			Facilitating Transmission Expansion to Support Efficient Decarbonization of the Electricity Sector	ECONOMICS OF ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY			English	Article						Electricity; transmission; decarbonization; wind generation; solar generation; regulation	COST; SCALE	Many governments, electric utilities, and large electricity consumers have committed to deep decarbonization of the electricity sector by 2050 or earlier. Over at least the next 30 years, achieving decarbonization targets will require replacing most fossil-fueled generators with zero carbon wind and solar generation along with energy storage to manage intermittency and for balancing more broadly. The best wind and solar resources are located in geographic areas that are often far from the locations of the legacy stock of generating plants and their supporting transmission infrastructure. Many studies have found that achieving decarbonization targets in a cost-efficient manner will require significant investments in new intra-regional and inter-regional transmission capacity. However, there are numerous barriers to planning, building, compensating, and financing this transmission capacity. They go beyond "NIMBY" opposition. These barriers are identified and potential reforms to reducing them are discussed here. The focus is on the U.S. and Europe. Comparing and contrasting U.S. and European responses to similar challenges yields suggestions for institutional, regulatory, planning, compensation and cost allocation policies that can reduce the barriers to efficient expansion of transmission capacity.

J	Qiu, Y; Cohen, S; Suh, S				Qiu, Yang; Cohen, Stuart; Suh, Sangwon			Decarbonization scenarios of the US Electricity system and their costs	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Electricity system modelling; Electricity system decarbonization; Cost; Renewable energy	SECTOR ENERGY ROADMAPS; RENEWABLE ENERGY; POWER-SYSTEM; DEEP DECARBONIZATION; EMISSIONS; WATER; WIND; PATHWAYS; CO2	Decarbonizing the electricity system to zero-carbon emission is crucial for climate change mitigation. Previous studies have shown that such a transition in the United States (U.S.) may lead to higher system cost compared to a business-as-usual case, but it is not well-known how the cost of electricity generation varies at sub-regional level under the transition, and studies have rarely evaluated the trade-off between the cost and avoided climate damages, as well as the potential roles of negative emission technologies (NETs) in the electricity decarbonization. Here, we present a regionally resolved national model to quantify the cost of decarbonizing the U.S. electricity system under a set of possible scenarios. The results show that, compared to the reference scenario without a decarbonization policy, reaching zero CO2 emission by 2050 would incur, depending on the scenarios, 335-494 billion USD additional cost to the U.S. electric power sector during 2020-2050. The regional costs of electricity generation ranges from 2.4 to 4.7 cent/kWh, largely due to the generation profiles and renewable resources availability of those regions. The additional costs can be translated to an average CO2 abatement cost of 29-59 USD/metric ton CO2 (with 2%-7% discount rates), which are comparable to the social cost of carbon in the literature at around 4% discount rate. The results also show that the cost of mitigating the last few percent CO2 emission from the U.S. electricity system may exceed the costs of NETs, indicating an opportunity for NETs to contribute to electricity decarbonization.

The purpose of the study is to identify how the public perceives decarbonisation determinants in order to develop a sustainable energy strategy for Poland. The transition of the energy market to low-carbon technology is a policy challenge. Governments must implement policies that are environmentally friendly, cost-effective, but, most of all, socially acceptable. Social acceptance risk plays a significant role in Poland, influencing the decarbonisation process. In Poland's case, the coal share is decreasing, but it is still the most important fuel for electricity production. This process of decarbonisation is a fundamental influence on the transformation of the energy sector in Poland. The social perception of solutions that can be applied was examined. The Polish natural environment is poisoned. Poles suffer from diseases related to the burning of coal for energy production. Societal awareness, how people perceive the government's actions, and what they expect in this regard is crucial.

Long term low-greenhouse gas emissions development strategies are key enabling instruments to reconcile near-to-medium term action with long term objectives. While a range of options exist to decarbonize the passenger transport sector, the detailed sequencing of actions and resulting transformations over time remain largely unexplained in policy debates. Scenarios from transport-energy modelling provide useful insights about technological strategies but often overlook other key drivers of transportation futures, including social, organizational and spatial determinants of mobility, and are not easily usable to inform policy discussions. In this paper, we introduce a new framework to design and compare long term national decarbonization pathways for passenger transportation. This framework is based on an iterative method combining detailed qualitative storylines, full scenario quantification and standardized dashboard reporting, adapted from the general Deep Decarbonization Pathways (DDP) framework. For illustration, the method is applied by four national research teams in Japan, the UK, Mexico and France, to derive country-specific decarbonization pathways. The results across countries show that: (i) strong action is needed across all types of options to reach deep decarbonization, notably demand-side solutions; (ii) deep decarbonization is compatible with other policy priorities such as satisfying mobility needs at affordable costs; and (iii) strategies should be tailored to mobility purpose, local contexts and national circumstances. The framework can be adapted to other sectors and should be further developed in the context of future policy processes. Key Policy insights Understanding deep decarbonization of the passenger transport sector requires a novel conceptual approach that articulates metrics across diverse dimensions (social, economic, energy, etc.) to increase policy relevance. We introduce a framework to design national decarbonization pathways for passenger transportation following this approach. Strong action across all pillars of decarbonization including demand-side solutions is needed to reach deep emissions reductions. Deep decarbonization is compatible with other policy priorities such as satisfying mobility needs at affordable costs. Strategies should be tailored to mobility purposes, local contexts and national circumstances.

J	Tozer, L				Tozer, Laura			The urban material politics of decarbonization in Stockholm, London and San Francisco	GEOFORUM			English	Article						Urban; Carbon; Climate change; Governance; Decarbonization; Materiality	CLIMATE-CHANGE; ENERGY TRANSITION; CARBON; POLICY; CITIES; CITY; GOVERNANCE; INFRASTRUCTURES; INSIGHTS; EUROPE	This paper examines the implementation of carbon governance initiatives targeting urban buildings and energy infrastructure and uses a material politics approach to evaluate whether these practices are triggering trajectories towards decarbonization. Urban low carbon transitions suggest a substantial re-ordering of urban infrastructure. However, there is a critical need to engage with the material implications of low carbon practices since research so far has painted a picture of incremental ambitions struggling in implementation. This paper interrogates how carbon governance is implemented through urban buildings and energy systems, and the implications for urban decarbonization, by drawing on three urban case studies: Stockholm, London and San Francisco. The analysis draws on interviews with representatives from government, industry, utilities, building owners, and non-governmental organizations who are striving to achieve decarbonization in their cities. Patterns are emerging in what is being made to matter politically through the translation of carbon governance into building-energy infrastructure. In particular, the paper finds that (1) a short-term decision making timeline encourages action that incrementally reduces greenhouse gas emissions without fundamentally overcoming carbon lock-in, (2) actors are harnessing exceptional urban space to overcome the tyranny of cost-effectiveness in maintaining fossil fuel entrenchment (with concerning implications for justice and uneven development), (3) there is a pattern of individualization of responsibility for decarbonization, and (4) material politics are limiting the application of low carbon retrofits for the existing built form. Overall, this paper examines the implementation of urban carbon governance while encompassing the messy, materially embedded, and contested nature of infrastructure transformations.

Moving the system boundaries in decarbonization of large islands	ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Sustainable islands; Smart islands; RES integration; Decarbonization		During the last few years, the majority of the EU Governments are implementing suitable energy policies, promoting a transition toward full decarbonized sustainable energy systems by 2050. This paper focuses on creating comprehensive decarbonization scenarios for the island systems, using EnergyPLAN software. The island of Sardinia, Italy, was selected as a case study. The presented method uses scenario approach and seeks to push the boundary of the island energy system and use the locally available resources to partially supply the maritime transport connecting the island to the mainland. The reference model was validated using the data provided by EDGAR and IEA for 2017. The Business as Usual Scenario and High Renewable Scenario by 2030 and 2050 were modelled. The latter considers the conversion of the Sardinia energy system into a smart, highly efficient and integrated system. For the power system, improvements are made by the installation of small decentralized renewable systems, mainly including photovoltaic and wind technologies, and increase of storage technologies use. Thermal demand is reduced by building energy refurbishment actions, including the envelope insulation and use of heat pumps. For the transport sector, raise of the share of electrical vehicles is expected, as well as the possibility to introduce biofuels in both maritime and road transport sectors. Results clearly show that carbon neutrality by 2050 is a reasonable target in different decarbonization scenarios. The study also provides useful suggestions to be implemented in order to achieve this goal.	[Calise, F.; Vicidomini, M.; Orlando, A.

A rapid expansion of renewables in the Chilean energy matrix, mostly thanks to exceptional solar and wind resources, combined with a rapid decrease in the cost of renewable energy technologies, intensified current policy debates to reduce the role of coal, which is the largest source of CO2 emissions in the generation mix. Recently, the main generation companies in Chile made a voluntary commitment to not invest in new coal projects that do not include carbon capture and storage systems. In addition, the Chilean government announced its plans to phase out coal plants completely by 2040. In this context, the aim of this research is to study the economy-wide and emission reduction impacts of different decarbonization paths in the Chilean power sector. For this purpose, we consider dynamic simulations using a new energy-oriented version of the Computable General Equilibrium Model (CGE)- General Equilibrium Model for the Chilean Economy (ECOGEM)-Chile which is soft linked to the bottom-up engineering energy model. The results show the major impacts under both the business as usual (BAU) scenario and the coal phase-out scenario. Additionally, the study discusses to what extent the ambitious decarbonization goals of the Chilean government are coherent with the current technological limitations.

This study reviews the effective decarbonization strategies in the context of Europe's climate neutral vision. Initially, the study analyzes the reasons for ever-increasing emissions and investigates the perception of decarbonization in line with various influencing factors such as population size, economic growth, energy intensity, emission intensity, innovation, affordability and time. Subsequently, an in-depth qualitative analysis is performed to force out the challenges that Europe faces in decarbonizing the heating sector from the aspects, such as using clean energy resources, effective heat energy conversion and management approaches. Sustainable approaches and practices are proposed to mitigate carbonization and to promote carbon sink in line with the major problems associated with various sectors such as building, energy, industry and transportation sector. Furthermore, the roles of digitalization in decarbonization are explored and the inherent challenges are also discussed. This study also reviews various decarbonization policies that can direct the governments' action to effectively make a transition towards a climate-neutral society. The key findings highlight that solar energy utilization in small-scale is relatively not preferable for heat energy conversion in Europe due to climatic conditions, while district heating network with bio-and geothermal energy resource highly favors clean heat transformation scenario. In addition, 3D printing has a prodigious role to reduce building lifecycle emissions and hybrid policies as well as reward-based policies yields better outcomes. Promoting hydrogen utilization and carbon capture storage and utilization technologies can pivot climate neutrality in the sectors that are difficult to decarbonize. On the other hand, it can be observed that more focus is provided to reduce emissions and significantly less attention is focused on carbon sink.

J	Britton, J; Woodman, B; Webb, J				Britton, Jess; Woodman, Bridget; Webb, Janette			Ideational bricolage as a route to transforming local institutions for heat decarbonisation: heat networks and local government in England	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY & PLANNING			English	Article						Discursive institutionalism; heat networks; urban climate governance; local government; bricolage	DISCURSIVE INSTITUTIONALISM; GOVERNANCE; DISCOURSE; IDEAS; POWER; TRANSITIONS	Heat networks could play a significant role in energy system decarbonisation. Unlike much energy infrastructure, heat networks are developed at a local-scale, raising questions about which actors and institutions, at which scales, will most effectively deliver networks. This paper examines different ideas about the role of local government and the translation of those ideas into the institutional framework for heat networks in England. The paper applies a discursive institutionalist approach to analyse ideas and discourses across three case studies and at the national level. We argue that there is a push back by local governments against the UK government dominant discourse of the efficient market in respect to heat network development. This model constitutes the role of local governments as enabling and convening actors, while emphasising techno-economic feasibility and private finance. There is, however, evidence of local governments specifying a more central ensuring role and incorporating local public goods beyond financial returns. We highlight ideational bricolage as a process by which the local state can mobilise ideational power to challenge dominant discourses. This demonstrates how powerful institutions, and their discursive components, can be disrupted - and potentially displaced - by locally led emergent, and perhaps only partially coherent, assemblages of ideas.

ENERGIES			English	Article						decarbonization; energy transition in the cities; low carbon policy; climate changes; energy efficiency in the cities	RENEWABLE ENERGY; DECISION-MAKING; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; EFFICIENCY; EMISSIONS; SECTOR; GOVERNANCE; MANAGEMENT; SECURITY; MODEL	The objective of this paper is to identify the determinants of decarbonization processes in Poland by urban and rural areas. It also presents directions for knowledge diffusion on decarbonization to develop a sustainable energy strategy for Poland, particularly for local governments and cities. Despite extensive research on the determinants of decarbonization and sustainable energy development, there is a lack of specific solutions in this area. The authors of this paper investigated which determinants, according to the respondents, would lead to better decarbonization solutions in cities and villages in terms of sustainability. The studied sample was purposefully selected and an online questionnaire was used with the use of the "snowball" method. The authors conducted surveys that allowed the concerned parties themselves (respondents) to indicate which factors they believe best influence decarbonization. Such measures are helpful in terms of the understanding public acceptance of decarbonization in terms of the energy transition. This is of particular importance in terms of green governance globally and in Europe. The results of the authors' research indicate that despite the reduction in the share of coal in residential and domestic heating, coal remains the main source of electricity generation and that the potential for low-carbon policy to have an impact on solving urban challenges is underestimated. From the findings, it can be concluded that more in-depth research is needed on public acceptance of decarbonization in its broadest sense and its implications.

The role of hydropower reservoirs in deep decarbonization policy	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Climate change mitigation macro-energy systems decarbonization hydropower energy systems engineering power system planning	POWER; ELECTRICITY; WIND; COST; TRANSMISSION; EMISSIONS; PATHWAYS; STORAGE	This paper analyzes the role of hydropower reservoirs in the deep decarbonization of power systems. Extending previous work, this study models the impact of hydro reservoirs on optimal planning decisions. It further provides a more holistic assessment of the role and economic value of hydro reservoirs through the use of a detailed capacity expansion and dispatch model. Our model is parameterized based on the power system of New England, U.S. and the hydro-based system of Quebec, Canada. We find that expanding transmission access to hydro reservoirs reduces the need for fossil-fuel power plants that may otherwise be deployed to balance renewable intermittency. Our results show that hydro access can accelerate decarbonization by decreasing optimal gas plant capacity and generation. At levels of very deep decarbonization, reservoir hydro reduces the need for Carbon Capture and Storage. Our modeling shows how hydro reservoirs accomplish this by serving as both a short- and long-term energy storage resource. We further show that, by reducing the need for more expensive balancing technologies and by enabling a more efficient utilization of variable renewables, hydro access lowers the cost of decarbonization, and that this benefit grows non-linearly with the decarbonization target.

Design/methodology/approach The authors used a validated energy literacy survey to assess undergraduate students' attitudes and behavioural intentions towards energy saving in two countries (Brazil and Belgium). The questionnaire, administered online, comprised 23 Likert scale questions and three questions eliciting socio-demographic information. Results were analysed using a linear regression model and compared with previous research using the same energy literacy instrument. Findings The research identified three dimensions of sustainable attitudes: citizens' role, scientists' role and government's role, explaining 65.5% of respondents' energy-related attitudes. Three dimensions of sustainable behaviours were identified, explaining 64.5% of energy-related behavioural intentions: consumption of eco-friendly products, financially driven behaviours and household energy saving. The linear regression model identified scientists' role, consumption of eco-friendly products and financially driven behaviour as the key predictors of student energy use. Differences between the two contexts also emerged. Research limitations/implications Individual action to improve energy saving is necessary, but not sufficient for decarbonisation. However, student attitudes and behavioural intentions towards energy are an important element of campus decarbonisation: these "micro" experiments can become a "network" searching for synergies at the campus level (in collaboration with the neighbourhood) and act as a catalyst towards a more profound carbon-free society. Limitations of the research include the use of a survey to ascertain estimates of energy use; however, the study offers a model for further research and a mode of analysis that would be useful to other researchers. Practical implications This research enables universities to better understand the drivers and barriers to student energy-saving activities and thereby promote decarbonisation on campus. This is a crucial underpinning in the creation of sustainable universities, linking education and campus developments. This survey was one of the catalysts to set up a total new maintenance energy performance contract (MEPC) at one of the authors' institutions, where energy efficiency was realised alongside other sustainability aspects, such as water saving, circular renovation and waste reduction. Social implications This research illustrates the challenges and opportunities of working with key stakeholders in university settings for university-based decarbonisation efforts. Intensive involvement of students and teachers in the new MEPC offers an example of co-creation with building "users" - which may have implications for other university building developments. Increasingly, universities need to consider the need for a new business model in which shared and multiple value creation is a key feature. Treating societal challenges as business opportunities is an important new dimension of corporate strategy and a powerful path to social progress, which higher education institutions should not overlook. Originality/value Student attitudes and behavioural intentions towards energy are an important element of campus decarbonisation and can act as a catalyst towards a carbon-free society. Although energy literacy research has been undertaken in the USA and UK, this research is the first of its kind for Belgium and Brazil, and the mode of analysis - using a linear regression model - differs from the earlier work, offering a novel methodological approach.

However, the rapid development of hydropower plants and the slowdown in the growth of electricity demand can easily cause imbalances in the energy system. Therefore, this study explores the possibility of achieving deep decarbonization by 2030 in a region which has a high installed hydropower capacity and proposes solutions to the problems of water abandonment and supply-demand imbalance. This is done by developing various models and pathways to meet the electricity, industry, and transportation energy demands in Sichuan Province, China within the confinement of the government policies. Hence, three different scenarios including reference scenarios, policy scenarios, and optimization scenarios are modeled. These scenarios consider the resource development potential of renewable energy, energy policies, and the development of advanced technologies. Under different hydropower generation capacities, hybrid hydropower-photovoltaic-wind-biomass energy systems are constructed using the EnergyPLAN model, and the planning models for a clean/zero-carbon energy system in 2030 are proposed. Results from the analysis of the models showed that the conservative policy models could reduce CO2 emissions to some extent. Decarbonization models with different levels of hydropower generation under different scenarios could all result in zero CO2 emissions. The large-scale use of energy storage results in a significant increase in investment costs, but a significant reduction in energy costs. The results of this study validate the possibility of achieving decarbonization in areas with high hydropower potential. This also suggests the best decarbonization model for meeting the different needs of the future energy system. This article provides a reference and basis for any province or region to achieve long-term decarbonization using hydropower.

Its case study of a staged policy intervention to promote the transition to a low carbon economy' in Victoria's coal-dependent Latrobe Valley reveals the selective use of evidence to support policy directions that emerged from the interaction of policy knowledge and the political mood. The paper shows how local conditions can be manipulated to enable the production of evidence consistent with the policy objective, but also suggests that despite combining orchestrated evidence with customised forms of networked governance, it is not possible to suppress or deflect unresolved political disagreements. This paper examines the use of evidence in networked governance. Using a staged policy framework, it shows that each stage of the process invoked a different type of evidence. The addition of new evidence shifted the definition of the problem in a way that enabled the process to move to the next stage. The conclusions reflect on the implications of policy-led evidence for democratic government and the challenges of decarbonisation.

This paper contributes to understandings of governing crises by exploring the tension be-tween short-term crisis response and the achievement of longer-term policy goals, through the discussion of the Covid-19 pandemic and localised decarbonisation ambitions in Greater Manchester. Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, Greater Manchester outlined ambitions to achieve carbon neutrality by 2038 through the use of a place-based approach. Greater Manchester has been subject to a range of lockdown restrictions throughout the pandemic, with all aspects of society being impacted including decarbonisation ambitions. Thus providing a useful case study for understanding the impact that Covid-19 has had on the development and implementation of Greater Manchester's decarbonisation ambitions. Within this focus is placed on the opportunities and constraints experienced.A total of 22 semi-structured interviews were conducted with stakeholders associated with Greater Man-chester's decarbonisation ambitions between October 2020 and April 2021. Stakeholders interviewed included regional and local government, academics, community organisations, non-profit organisations and activist groups. Novel insights obtained through the stakeholder interviews highlight how Covid-19 has simultaneously constrained and provided opportunities for decarbonisation in Greater Manchester. Based upon the experiences of the stakeholders interviewed, 4 crises which have affected the achievement of longer-term decarbonisation ambitions have been identified - a communication crisis, an engagement crisis, a participation crisis and crises of temporality. The crises identified and discussed either emerged or intensified as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Although these crises are discussed in relation to the impact of Covid-19 on decarbonisation, the learnings identified can be applied to other crises and long-term strategic ambitions.

Local governments and stakeholders are developing short-term strategies and long-term pathways towards deep decarbonization at the local level but are struggling to determine effective actions. In this article, we examine cities pursuing deep decarbonization to provide insights into the strategies and governance structures that eight leading local governments are using to develop and implement deep decarbonization plans. The cases are in Canada (Bridgewater, Guelph, Vancouver and Toronto), the USA (Park City and New York City), Finland (Lahti), and Norway (Oslo) and range from very small (8.4 thousand people) to very large (9.6 million people). For each city, their implementation strategies are detailed under four categories: engagement; green economy; policy tools; and financial tools. Governance mechanisms and modes are explained regarding coordination; oversight and reporting; communication; multi-level integration; cross-sector collaboration; funding, and mode. While a number of these approaches and tools have been identified in previous research and grey literature, the findings show that leading local government plans continue to develop innovative strategies on their own and also share their successes with other communities through transnational networks. The cases examined in this study are moving beyond the incremental approach to mitigating greenhouse gases and are innovating to find applied methods for achieving transformative change. The findings from this study are useful for practitioners and academics working on climate mitigation, strategy implementation, cross-sector partnerships, and sustainable cities.

Achieving this goal in the United States requires a national, economy-wide transformation in energy production and use in five sectors: electricity, transportation, industry, land-based carbon sinks, and buildings. All of these sectors interact with planning for the built environment and land use, so planning scholars and practitioners have many opportunities to engage policymakers working on national-level decarbonization strategies. This article analyzes the consequences of deep decarbonization for the future speed, scale, scope, role, and relevance of planning.	[Hsu, David; P.

Our model seeks the optimal investment for a firm to achieve maximum profit under constraints derived from its environmental protection awareness and the government's taxation policy. We use an uncertainty theory to formulate the relationship of a firm's environmental protection awareness and its investment budget levels. Governments' taxation policy is modelled by a step-wise linear function, where reduced carbon dioxide emission can help the firm reduce taxation. A linearisation is proposed to solve the non-linear problem efficiently. A case study for a sector of electronic component manufacturers in Nottingham, the United Kingdom, demonstrates the practical implementation of the proposed model. Several large-sized instances, which were randomly generated, were utilised to evaluate the the efficiency of model in terms of computational time. Our model can be used to explore budget options to obtain higher profits under a particular taxation policy.

Integrating housing stock and energy system models as a strategy to improve heat decarbonisation assessments	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Heat; MARKAL; Decarbonisation; UK; Housing stock; Model	BUILT ENVIRONMENT; CO2 EMISSIONS; SECTOR; GAS; TECHNOLOGIES; POTENTIALS; SCENARIOS; NETWORK; DEMAND; MARKET	The UK government heat strategy is partially based on decarbonisation pathways from the UK MARKAL energy system model. We review how heat provision is represented in UK MARKAL, identifying a number of shortcomings and areas for improvement. We present a completely revised model with improved estimations of future heat demands and a consistent representation of all heat generation technologies. This model represents all heat delivery infrastructure for the first time and uses dynamic growth constraints to improve the modelling of transitions according to innovation theory. Our revised model incorporates a simplified housing stock model, which is used produce highly-refined decarbonisation pathways for residential heat provision. We compare this disaggregated model against an aggregated equivalent, which is similar to the existing approach in UK MARKAL. Disaggregating does not greatly change the total residential fuel consumption in two scenarios, so the benefits of disaggregation will likely be limited if the focus of a study is elsewhere. Yet for studies of residential heat, disaggregation enables us to vary consumer behaviour and government policies on different house types, as well as highlighting different technology trends across the stock, in comparison with previous aggregated versions of the model.

Residential willingness to pay for deep decarbonization of electricity supply: Contingent valuation evidence from Hong Kong	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Residential willingness-to-pay; Electricity decarbonization; Contingent valuation; Hong Kong	RENEWABLE ENERGY-SOURCES; GREEN ELECTRICITY; STATUS-QUO; ATTRIBUTES; PREFERENCE; CHOICE; POLICY; CHINA; BIAS	Motivated by the government's proposed target of reducing CO2 emissions by 30% of the 2005 level in the year 2020, we estimate the residential willingness-to-pay (WTP) for deep decarbonization of Hong Kong's electricity supply, which is heavily dependent on coal-fired generation. Our contingent valuation survey conducted in 2016 of 1460 households yields dichotomous choice data based on the respondents' answers to a series of closed ended questions. Such data are less susceptible to the strategic bias that often plagues self-stated WIT data obtained by direct elicitation via open-ended questions. Using binary choice models, we find that average WTP is 48-51%, relative to current bills, if the decarbonization target is achieved via natural gas generation and renewable energy. However, estimated WTP declines to 32-42% when decarbonization entails additional nuclear imports from China. As the projected bill increase caused by the target's implementation is 40%, our WTP estimates support the government's fuel mix policy of using natural gas and renewable energy to displace Hong Kong's coal generation.

J	Barrett, J; Cooper, T; Hammond, GP; Pidgeon, N				Barrett, John; Cooper, Tim; Hammond, Geoffrey P.; Pidgeon, Nick			Industrial energy, materials and products: UK decarbonisation challenges and opportunities	APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Industry; Energy use; Decarbonisation; Thermodynamic analysis and carbon accounting; Consumers, producers and publics; United Kingdom	EFFICIENCY; EMISSIONS; DEMAND; DECOMPOSITION; REDUCTION; CONSTRUCTION; COUNTRIES; IMPACTS; SECTOR; GAP	The United Kingdom (UK) has placed itself on a transition pathway towards a low carbon economy and society, through the imposition of a legally-binding target aimed at reducing its 'greenhouse gas' (GHG) emissions by 80% by 2050 against a 1990 baseline. Reducing industrial energy demand could make a substantial contribution towards this decarbonisation goal, while simultaneously improving productivity and creating employment opportunities. Both fossil fuel and process GHG emissions will need to be significantly reduced by 2050. Ultimately, all industrial energy use and emissions result from the demand for goods and services. Energy is required at each stage in the manufacture of a product from raw material extraction through to the final distribution and eventual disposal. The required energy and associated GHG emissions along UK supply chains emanate from many different countries, due to the growth of globalisation. A range of socio-technical methods for analysing decarbonisation have therefore been explored. Efficiency gains can be made in industry, including those associated with the use of heat and with improvements in processing. Changes in the materials needed to manufacture products (via material substitution, light-weighting and 'circular economy' interventions) can also lead to emissions reductions. Likewise, altering the way the final consumer (industry, households or government) use products, including through product longevity and shifts from goods to services, can further reduce energy demand. The findings of an interdisciplinary study of industrial decarbonisation is therefore reported. This gave rise to the identification of the associated challenges, insights and opportunities, in part stemming from the development of a novel set of 2050 decarbonisation 'technology roadmaps' for energy-intensive industries in the UK. These determinations provide a valuable evidence base for industrialists, policy makers, and other stakeholders. The lessons learned are applicable across much of the wider industrialised world.

In this perspective, we take a look at policies, strategies, and actions in Norway to realize its ambitious goals from a technological and materials development standpoint, as we are facing the change of pace after the Paris agreement in 2015 and the Katowice 2018 global climate panel meeting. Among the largest exporters of fossil fuels, Norway compensates by intensive investments in the development of carbon capture and sequestration. Following a growing debate involving the entire society, the Norwegian government has taken on aggressive strategies toward the decarbonization of energy production. We herein discuss the activities going on and the peculiar situation in Norway, which lives the rich life provided by fossil fuels while tasting the dream of being the climate knight of the world.

J	Pye, S; Bataille, C				Pye, Steve; Bataille, Chris			Improving deep decarbonization modelling capacity for developed and developing country contexts	CLIMATE POLICY			English	Article						Decarbonization; modelling; pathways; policy; tools		Energy models are essential for the development of national or regional deep decarbonization pathways (DDPs), providing the necessary analytical framework to systematically explore the system transitions that are required. However, this is challenging due to the long time horizon, the numerous data requirements and the need for transparent, credible approaches that can provide insights into complex transitions. This article explores how this challenge has been met to date, based on a review of the literature and the experiences of practitioners, drawing in particular on the Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project (DDPP), a collaborative effort by 16 national modelling teams. The article finds that there are a range of modelling approaches that have been used across different country contexts, chosen for different reasons, with recognized strengths and weaknesses. The key motivations for use of a given approach include being fit-for-purpose, having in-country capacity and the intertwined goals of transparency, communicability and policy credibility. From the review, a conceptual decision framework for DDP analysis is proposed. This three step process incorporates policy priorities, national characteristics and the model-agnostic principles that drive model choices, considering the needs and capabilities of developed and developing countries, and subject to data and analytical practicalities. Finally an agenda for the further development of modelling approaches is proposed, which is vital for strengthening capacity. These include a focus on model linking, incorporating behaviour and policy impacts, the flexibility to handle distinctive energy systems, incorporating wider environmental constraints and the development of entry-level tools. The latter three are critical for application in developing countries. Policy relevance Following the Paris Agreement, it is essential that modelling approaches are available to enable governments to plan how to decarbonize their economies in the long term. This article takes stock of current practices, identifies the strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches and proposes how capacity can be strengthened. It also provides some practical guidance on the process of choosing modelling approaches, given national priorities and circumstances. This is particularly relevant as countries revisit their Nationally Determined Contributions to meet the global objective of remaining well below a 2 degrees C average global temperature increase.

Uncertainties in key low carbon power generation technologies - Implication for UK decarbonisation targets	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Low carbon electricity; Decarbonisation; Uncertainty	ELECTRICITY-GENERATION; POLICY IMPLICATIONS; ENERGY SYSTEM; SECTOR; WIND; COST; SCENARIOS; MODEL; ECONOMY; BENEFIT	The UK government's economy-wide 60% carbon dioxide reduction target by 2050 requires a paradigm shift in the whole energy system. Numerous analytical studies have concluded that the power sector is a critical contributor to a low carbon energy system, and electricity generation has dominated the policy discussion on UK decarbonisation scenarios. However, range of technical, social and market challenges, combined with alternate market investment strategies mean that large scale deployment of key classes of low carbon electricity technologies is fraught with uncertainty. The UK MARKAL energy systems model has been used to investigate these long-term uncertainties in key electricity generation options. A range of power sector specific parametric sensitivities have been performed under a 'what-if' framework to provide a systematic exploration of least-cost energy system configurations under a broad, integrated set of input assumptions. In this paper results of six sensitivities, via restricted investments in key low carbon technologies to reflect their technical and political uncertainties, and an alternate investment strategies from perceived risk and other barriers, have been presented.

J	Kuriyama, A; Abe, N				Kuriyama, Akihisa; Abe, Naoya			Decarbonisation of the power sector to engender a 'Just transition' in Japan: Quantifying local employment impacts	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS			English	Article						Just transition; Decarbonisation; Power sector; Renewable energy; Employment; Transition Management; Gini coefficient		"Just Transition" is an important, brand new concept to implement policies towards decarbonisation of the power sector in Japan. However, a knowledge gap still remains between this concept and policy discussion at a practical level. Therefore, using the existing scenarios of decarbonisation of the power sector and employment factors for the power sector based on extended input-output tables, this study analysed "Just Transition" issues, looking at the concept from three aspects: distributional justice to identify key impacts by location and economic sector; recognition justice to assess key inequalities; and procedural justice which deal with fair process and possible measures to enhance acceptability of climate policies. The results of this study show that achieving decarbonisation of the power sector provides a net increase in domestic employment and supplies stable jobs in rural areas, thereby contributing to the revitalisation of the local economy. Furthermore, it improves inequalities in the working age population. Support from either national or local government is required to ensure a workforce is in place to enable a rapid increase in renewable energy. To achieve decarbonisation of the power sector with high political acceptability, it is essential to make early decision on the retirement of conventional power plants and to implement policy support for the surplus workers from conventional power plants.

There has been increased interest from important stakeholders regarding deep decarbonization, evidenced by market surveys conducted by Shell and Deloitte. However, deep decarbonization will require financial incentives and policies at an international and regional level given the maritime sector's similar to 3% contribution to green house gas (GHG) emissions. The review paper, based on research articles and grey literature, discusses technoeconomic problems and/or benefits for technologies that will help the shipping sector achieve the IMO's targets. The review presents a discussion on the recent literature regarding alternative fuels (nuclear, hydrogen, ammonia, methanol), renewable energy sources (biofuels, wind, solar), the maturity of technologies (fuel cells, internal combustion engines) as well as technical and operational strategies to reduce fuel consumption for new and existing ships (slow steaming, cleaning and coating, waste heat recovery, hull and propeller design). The IMO's 2050 targets will be achieved via radical technology shift together with the aid of social pressure, financial incentives, regulatory and legislative reforms at the local, regional and international level.

Understanding governments' policy action in the short and medium term is key to assess whether the response to the crisis will crowd out or fast-track decarbonization efforts. We surveyed over 200 policymakers and stakeholders from 55 different countries to collect climate policy expectations in various sectors and regions in the next five years. While support for high-emitting sectors is not expected to dissolve completely, commitment to policies supporting the transition to low-carbon energy and transport sectors is expected to increase substantially. This is true for OECD and Asian countries, representing approximately 90% of global emissions. Our results suggest that expectations that the COVID-19 pandemic will accelerate decarbonization efforts are widely shared.

J	Eslava-Bautista, J; Cottrill, CD; Beecroft, M				Eslava-Bautista, Jorge; Cottrill, Caitlin D.; Beecroft, Mark			Impacts of decarbonization on the automotive after sales sector: A review of evidence	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART D-JOURNAL OF AUTOMOBILE ENGINEERING			English	Review						Automotive after sales; spare parts; customer service; decarbonization; electrification of vehicles	BUSINESS MODELS; SERVICE; TRANSPORT; EMISSIONS; ENERGY; VEHICLES; CHINA; CARS	Automotive after sales, which include provision of spare parts, customer service, and accessories sales, is one of the most profitable parts of the automotive industry and provides for an ongoing relationship with the customer. In times of recession, performance of after sales remains steady as it is highly independent of macroeconomic behaviors and keeps outstanding margins. Current automotive after sales are predominantly based on fossil fuel power train technologies, involving a significant number of replaceable working parts, lubricants, and supplies, and requiring ongoing manual labor. Current efforts to decarbonize the automotive industry, however, have the potential to disrupt this industry by shifting traditional after sales business models. The objective of this paper is to review the background and development of policies and actions in relation to the decarbonization of transport with a particular focus upon the role of the automotive after sales sector. The review considers the role of a range of stakeholders including multilateral bodies setting targets for participating nations; national governments; and the automotive industry, operating at varying scales. Electrification of vehicles and discouragement of car use and ownership are identified as key decarbonization strategies that could significantly impact upon car manufacturers and the broader automotive industry, which will in turn impact upon the after sales market. The review concludes that there has been limited research about impacts on after sales markets from transport decarbonization strategies. Areas of impact identified include reduction of working parts, fewer additional units, longer service intervals, changes in labor needs, disruption in customer retention, and changes to the repurchase cycle. In order to explore these potential impacts, the development of alternative future scenarios under different power train technologies and regional factors is recommended as an area for further research.

The making of low-carbon urbanism: Climate change, discursive strategy, and rhetorical decarbonization in Chinese cities	ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING C-POLITICS AND SPACE			English	Article						Low-carbon urbanism; discourse analysis; climate governance; rhetorical decarbonization; Chinese cities	DISCOURSE ANALYSIS; ECO-CITY; POLITICS; POLICY; SUSTAINABILITY; TRANSITIONS; ENVIRONMENT	Existing studies of the incorporation of climate mitigation into urban governance are concerned overwhelmingly with the material aspects of low-carbon urbanism. Emphasis is placed upon the measurable, quantifiable, and technical characteristics of carbon, whereas the (uneven) leverage of its rhetoric value across different state spaces/scales is largely overlooked. This paper engages with ongoing theoretical enquiries through a study that applies a discursive-analytical perspective to examining the rise of low-carbon cities (LCCs) and the actual practicing of rhetorical decarbonization strategies in Shenzhen, China. The making of the LCC is found to be incentivized by the perceived symbolic value and enabling power of the climate agenda in attracting higher-level government supports, maintaining local collations, and enticing international attention and investment. This enabling power depends on the interpretive flexibility within decarbonization discourse and the manipulation of the discourse to justify involuntary socio-economic changes. Findings of this research call for greater attention paid to the overlooked discursive dimensions of low-carbon urbanism as the constitutive elements of ongoing global urban transformation processes.

Techno-economic comparison of technology options for deep decarbonization and electrification of residential heating.	ENERGY EFFICIENCY			English	Article						Decarbonization; Electrification; Residential heating; Heat pump; District heating; Levelized costs; Switzerland	RENEWABLE ENERGY; BUILDING ENERGY; COST; PATHWAYS; BIOMASS	This study aims to provide detailed information on the key technologies that utilize renewables for decarbonization and electrification of the residential heating sector. To contextualize and compare the economics of the technologies, a levelized cost model is employed to perform a comparative analysis for a dense urban area in Switzerland. The outcome shows that decarbonization of the heat supply with a dominant share of renewables is feasible, but it is challenged by the high cost of some options. In the given context (current energy and CO2 prices, no coercive measures), the rapid shift from conventional boilers to electrification via decentralized heat pumps and/or the introduction of targeted small-scale thermal energy networks utilizing cheap local resources like industrial excess heat is the most viable option. The replacement of natural gas boilers with electrification technologies also is recommendable because it would result in a sixfold reduction in specific CO2 emissions. Wide-scale application of heat pumps may require significant electricity grid reinforcement which ultimately may escalate the costs. Large-scale district heating systems are currently relatively expensive due to the high network costs and require a sustainable financing mechanism.

Indra			An overview of palm oil biomass for power generation sector decarbonization in Malaysia: Progress, challenges, and prospects	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Review						bioenergy; palm oil biomass; power generation; synergetic decarbonization	FEED-IN TARIFF; RENEWABLE ENERGY POLICIES; SUPPLY CHAINS; COMBUSTION; PYROLYSIS; EMISSIONS; OPTIMIZATION; INITIATIVES; DEMAND; FUTURE	With the ever-increasing danger of climate change, power plants are shifting from polluting fossil fuels to sustainable bioenergy fuels. As Malaysia continues to pledge to decrease glasshouse gas (GHG) emissions, quick and dramatic action should resolve the reliance on fossil fuel power plants. Furthermore, the coal-fired power station is Malaysia's biggest supplier of energy and the final power plant to be decommissioned. In Malaysia, a significant portion of palm oil biomass has the potential to replace coal in the generation of renewable energy power. However, the deployment of palm oil biomass as a renewable energy source has not been fully achieved. Furthermore, the surplus of unutilized biomass from the palm oil milling process has emerged as the key talking point leading to environmental concerns. As estimated, this palm oil biomass can generate approximately 5000 MW of electricity under 40% of operation efficiency. This significant power potential has the ability to replace Malaysia's yearly reliance on coal. Nonetheless, the limitations of technological stability, budgetary constraints, and other government policy concerns have prevented the potentials from being fulfilled. This necessitates an integrated framework that synergizes the decarbonization drive in order to realize the primary advantages of energy renewability and carbon neutrality. Among the suggested actions to decarbonize the power generating sector is an integrated scheme of palm oil production, biogas plant for electricity and steam generation, and biofuel pellet manufacture. This review provides an in-depth overview of palm oil biomass for Malaysian power production decarbonization.

Overcoming barriers to supply chain decarbonization: Case studies of first movers	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING			English	Article						Carbon neutrality; Net zero; Supply chain decarbonization; Carbon -neutral supply chain; Barrier; Performance	EMISSIONS	Excess greenhouse gas emissions from human and industrial activities are believed to be the key cause of catastrophic climate change. According to the United Nations, carbon neutrality by 2050 is the world's most urgent mission. Many countries recently made commitments to this mission; however, at a supply chain level, little is known about barriers to carbon neutrality, circumventing strategies, and their performance implications. This pioneering study addresses the knowledge gap by case studies of six first movers. We find four common barriers: "major upfront investment costs," "lack of awareness," "lack of expertise," and "resistant mindset." Small and medium-sized enterprises face additional barriers relating to "lack of support from supply chain partners" and "uncertainty in return on investment." We find that most first movers achieved positive economic performance associated with their carbon neutrality initiatives. Based on the findings and the literature, we develop a framework and discuss practical implications for governments and businesses to jointly overcome barriers to supply chain decarbonization.

J	Li, Y; Lukszo, Z; Weijnen, M				Li, Ying; Lukszo, Zofia; Weijnen, Margot			The impact of inter-regional transmission grid expansion on China's power sector decarbonization	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Inter-regional transmission grid; Impact; Decarbonization; China; Unit commitment	PLANNING-MODEL; SYSTEM; ENERGY	This paper investigates the impact of the inter-regional transmission grid capacity expansion on China's power sector decarbonization from the energy portfolio, economic efficiency and environmental perspectives. The impact is quantified based on a cluster integer unit commitment model which renders it suitable for modeling large-scale power systems with a high computational performance. The results show that, first, the inter-regional transmission grid capacity expansion has obvious economic benefit in reducing the total variable generation costs, mainly due to the increased ability of transmitting coal power with low marginal generation costs and the reduction in non-served load. Second, the expansion has a very limited impact on reducing the curtailment of renewable generation by 2030, although the extent to which the expansion can mitigate the curtailment of renewable generation increases with the share of renewable power in the generation portfolio. Third, the expansion increases CO2 emissions of the power supply in 2030 by around 2%, mainly because it facilitates more use of cheap yet low-efficiency coal generation in regions with low fuel prices. To better deliver the value of the inter-regional grid expansion for China's power decarbonization, this paper proposes that: (1) the planning of the inter-regional and intra-regional grid development should be coordinated with the renewable power development; and (2) effective dispatch mechanisms which account for CO2 emissions or generation efficiency across regions should be established. Additionally, the government plan of the inter-regional transmission capacity in 2030 is basically sufficient in enabling bulk power delivery and promoting renewable generation across regions.

J	Su, YJ; Hiltunen, P; Syri, S; Khatiwada, D				Su, Yijie; Hiltunen, Pauli; Syri, Sanna; Khatiwada, Dilip			Decarbonization strategies of Helsinki metropolitan area district heat companies	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS			English	Article						District heating; Decarbonization; Carbon price; Heat trading; Finland; Biomass; Heat pump	SYSTEM; IMPACT; PUMPS; OPTIMIZATION; FUTURE	District heating is of great significance for the Nordic countries due to the high heat demand. The Finnish government has set a national target of carbon neutrality in 2035. This implies a huge challenge and rapid system change. The Helsinki metropolitan area consists of Helsinki, Espoo and Vantaa, and in each city a different district heating company operates, and the technologies planned for decarbonization are different. This research aims to analyze these strategies with respect to carbon dioxide emissions and production costs, assuming different future European Union emissions carbon trading prices. The software EnergyPRO is used to provide least-cost optimal district heating operation solutions. From 2010 to 2030, carbon dioxide emissions from the Helsinki metropolitan area district heating will decrease by about 4.2 million tonnes. However, the average heat production costs are expected to increase considerably by almost threefold; while heat trade between the cities will reinforce the feasibility and decreases the system operation costs and total emissions. Helsinki will import heat, especially from Vantaa waste incineration plants. Higher carbon dioxide prices would reduce the total emissions, increase the total district heating operation costs, and lower the heat imported to Helsinki. As all the cities plan biomass as an alternative to fossil fuels, a higher biomass price would limit its consumption but in-crease natural gas usage the carbon dioxide emissions. In the future, combined heat and power plants will be used significantly less, leading to lost income on electricity sales and profoundly changing the business of the district heating companies.

J	Fang, YH; Xu, HY				Fang, Yinhai; Xu, Haiyan			Research on Decarbonization Pathway of China's Coal-Fired Power Industry From the Perspective of Conflict Mediation	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article						carbon peak; carbon neutrality; decarbonization pathway; coal-fired power industry; conflict mediation	ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; CO2 EMISSIONS; IMPACT; GENERATION; MINERS	The transition to a low-carbon energy system is imminent under the constraints of carbon-peaking and carbon-neutral targets. Undoubtedly, coal-related carbon emissions over the past decades have had profound negative impacts on human life and the global climate. However, the main position of coal in the energy system determines that pure coal reduction strategy will inevitably lead to a systemic energy crisis. To this end, we explore the conflict formation mechanism among coal enterprises, downstream coal-fired power plants, and government in the process of strategic energy decarbonization transformation from the perspective of industrial chain, and analyze the feasible conflict states and their NASH, GMR, SMR, and SEQ equilibrium characteristics by constructing a ternary GMCR model. It is found that there are two feasible conflict states s 10 and s 12 that simultaneously satisfy the conditions of the above four types of equilibria. In this context, the evolution paths of s 10 and s 12 are further analyzed and conflict mediation strategies are proposed accordingly. Meanwhile, the decarbonization transition of the energy system needs to consider both the stage characteristics and regional differences of energy reform, as well as the important role of green low-carbon technological innovation as a grip for the decarbonization transition of energy.

J	Sokolowski, J; Bouzarovski, S				Sokolowski, Jakub; Bouzarovski, Stefan			Decarbonisation of the Polish residential sector between the 1990s and 2021: A case study of policy failures	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Energy transition; Decarbonisation; Energy poverty; Air quality; Public policy	ENERGY TRANSITION; POLAND; HOUSEHOLDS; COAL	In this paper, we study the policies that regulated the energy mix in the Polish residential sector between 1990 and 2021. We apply a qualitative assessment of policies and difference-in-differences to evaluate the effects of particular regulations. We find that policymakers in Poland did not identify households as stakeholders in their strategies since starting the energy transformation back in the 1990s until the early 2020s. We demonstrate that the government policies failed to stimulate efficient decarbonisation of the residential sector and did not address such issues as energy poverty and air pollution, while the coal consumption rates by Polish households remained the highest in the European Union. The situation has started to change since 2017 when the first regions in Poland introduced anti-smog regulations, which have had a minor, yet positive effect on air quality and the decrease in the number of coal stoves. Furthermore, "Clean air" and "My electricity" programmes were introduced in 2018 and 2019, which provided subsidies for investments in clean heating technologies, and small-scale photovoltaics. These support instruments have yielded relatively positive results. Finally, the Polish energy policy of 2021 identified decarbonisation in the residential sector, reducing energy poverty and improving air quality as key priorities.

J	Cowell, R; Webb, J				Cowell, Richard; Webb, Jan			Making useful knowledge for heat decarbonisation: Lessons from local energy planning in the United Kingdom	ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Heat decarbonisation; Wicked problems; Knowledge frames; Framing and overflowing; Energy; Local energy planning	INNOVATION; SOCIOLOGY	Heat decarbonisation is challenging in many countries, but few studies address its `wicked problem' qualities and the implications for producing useful knowledge. This paper elucidates the challenges by applying insights from science and technology studies, especially Callon's concept of knowledge `frames', to explain the fate of a prominent UK innovation - the EnergyPath Networks (EPN) and Local Area Energy Planning (LAEP) tool of the Smart Systems and Heat programme. The aim of the tool, which coupled an engineering model with local planning, was to provide authoritative knowledge to support local decision making. However, after six years of piloting with local authorities the future take-up of EPN and LAEP remained uncertain, for two key reasons. First the techno-economic knowledge frame encountered numerous overflows emanating from more potent politicaleconomic and technological perspectives governing local priorities. Second the framing of local decision making neglected the marginality of energy planning at local government level. Our analysis shows the problems that arise when lab-based research and development prematurely frame energy system problems, before encountering societal and political contexts of use. Problem definitions and solutions for heat decarbonisation based predominantly on technical-economic knowledge lack requisite authority to progress this wicked problem, and must become more context-responsive.

We apply the integrated assessment model MEDEAS-World to study four global transportation decarbonization strategies for 2050. The results show that a massive replacement of oil-fueled individual vehicles to electric ones alone cannot deliver GHG reductions consistent with climate stabilization and could result in the scarcity of some key minerals, such as lithium and magnesium. In addition, energy-economy feedbacks within an economic growth system create a rebound effect that counters the benefits of substitution. The only strategy that can achieve the objectives globally follows the Degrowth paradigm, combining a quick and radical shift to lighter electric vehicles and non-motorized modes with a drastic reduction in total transportation demand.

J	Worrell, E; Boyd, G				Worrell, Ernst; Boyd, Gale			Bottom-up estimates of deep decarbonization of US manufacturing in 2050	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Climate change mitigation; Decarbonization; Energy efficiency; Electrification; Renewables; Material efficiency	ENERGY EFFICIENCY; TECHNOLOGY; RESOURCES; REDUCTION; OPTIONS; SECTOR; WATER	The world needs to rapidly reduce emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission to stave off the risks of disastrous climate change. In particular, decarbonizing U.S. manufacturing industries is particularly challenging due to the specific process requirements. This study estimates the potential for future CO2 emission reductions in this important sector. The analysis is a detailed accounting exercise that relies on estimates of emission-reduction potential from other studies and applies those potentials to the manufacturing sector using a bottom-up approach. The actions are grouped into four "pillars" that support deep decarbonization of manufacturing (DDM): Energy Efficiency, Material Efficiency, Industry-Specific, and Power Grid. Based on this bottom-up approach, the analysis shows that an 86% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from the Reference Case is feasible. No single pillar dominates DDM, although opportunities vary widely by sub-sector. The analysis shows that a strategy incorporating a broad set of elements from each pillar can be effective instead of relying on any single pillar. Some pillars, such as Energy Efficiency and Material Efficiency, have wide applicability; others have key niche roles that are Industry-Specific; the Power Grid pillar requires interaction between grid decarbonization and industry action to switch from fossil fuels to zero-carbon electricity where appropriate.

Decarbonization pathways for the power sector in Sumatra, Indonesia	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS			English	Article						Decarbonization; Power system modeling; Nationally determined contributions (NDC); Biomass power; Low emissions analysis platform (LEAP); Indonesia	OIL MILL EFFLUENT; PALM OIL; BIOMASS; ELECTRICITY; SYSTEM; GENERATION; MITIGATION; RENEWABLES; SCENARIOS; EVOLUTION	The Indonesian power sector faces the combined challenge to (i) satisfy growing electricity demand at an affordable cost and (ii) comply with the decarbonization targets committed under the Paris Agreement. In this study, we investigate cost-optimal pathways for the development of the power sector in line with climate targets. We used the Low Emissions Analysis Platform (LEAP) software tool to build a power-system expansion model for Sumatra and simulated four scenarios representing a business as usual development, the current development plans, and two mitigation pathways in line with the national climate targets. Particular focus is put on bioenergy, an energy source that has been often overlooked in previous studies and plans. The results show that, although the national plans consider mitigation actions, they do not reduce coal dependency. Besides, current development plans are not cost-effective and have high marginal abatement costs for emissions reduction. The two mitigation scenarios achieve better environmental results at lower system costs. Our results show that bioenergy deployment can contribute significantly to achieving the greenhouse gas (GHG) targets of 19% and 24% pledged by the Indonesian government. More efficient use of modern renewables and natural gas can reduce Sumatra's dependence on coal resources.

However, capturing this changing role through national-based analyses is challenging due to the global nature of fossil fuel demand and resulting trade patterns. This article sets out the limitations of existing national-scale decarbonization analyses in adequately capturing global conditions and explores how the introduction of a global modelling framework could provide vital insights, particularly for those countries that are dependent on fossil fuel exports or imports. The article shows that fossil fuel use will significantly decline by 2050, although gas will have an important transition role. This leaves large fossil fuel exporters exposed, the extent of which is determined by mitigation action in different regions and especially by the pathways adopted by the larger Asian economies. We find that global-scale models provide critical insights that complement the more detailed national analyses and should play a stronger role in informing deep decarbonization pathways (DDPs). They also provide an important basis for exploring key uncertainties around technology uptake, mitigation rates and how this plays out in the demand for fossil fuels. However, use of global models also calls for improved representation of country specifics in global models, which can oversimplify national economic and political realities. Using both model scales provides important insights that are complementary but that can challenge the other's orthodoxy. However, neither can replace the other's strengths. Policy relevance: In recent years, how global fossil fuel markets will evolve under different climate regimes has been subject to much debate and analysis. This debate includes whether investments in fossil fuel production still make sense or will be exposed in the future to liabilities associated with high carbon prices. This is important for governments who need to develop coherent policy in relation to fossil fuel sectors and their role as drivers of economic growth and in providing for domestic energy needs. This article argues that national analyses need to be fully cognizant of the global-scale transition, which can be informed by using a multi-scale modelling approach.

Turning points for sustainability transitions: Institutional destabilization, public finance and the techno-economic dynamics of decarbonization in South Africa	ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Decarbonisation; Turning point; Conjuncture; South Africa; Budget process; Transition risk		Existing socio-technical systems tend to be intransigent to change. Decarbonisation, on the other hand, is an imperative, leading to an obvious conflict between the need for, and highly effective resistance to, change. Moreover, the abandonment of fossil fuel-based technologies in favour of more sustainable alternatives will require substantial reallocation of government's operational expenditure, particularly in countries like South Africa with high per capita greenhouse gas emissions and low per capita income. In this article, it is argued that reallocation will require more than niche experimentation and destabilisation of the present socio-technical regime. Based on a study of South Africa's budget processes, it is concluded that change will only occur when four separate pre-conditions converge, namely a rapidly growing environmental problem capable of leading to civil unrest, a supportive and recently developed policy framework, decreasing techno-economic costs for its solution, and strong political support from an effective ministry or minister. Turning points for transition, although infrequent, can be reached through strategic attention to these pre-conditions. A modified Kingdon multiple streams approach, which introduces the additional dimension of techno-economic feasibility, is proposed as a useful framework for anticipating when and how to act in order to mobilise sufficient public resources for decarbonisation.

The country also holds the world's third largest oil reserves in the Alberta oil sands. Given increasing emissions from the oil sands sector, achieving Canada's net-zero target requires significant oil sands decarbonization. If, while phasing out fossil fuels, there is still a demand for Canadian oil sands, then the decarbonization of the resource production process becomes crucial. In this study, we use an enhanced version of the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM) with a detailed unconventional oil sector for Canada, including mining and in situ resources. We ask, what is the future of the oil sands sector in deeply decarbonized global and Canadian economies? We address this question under four mitigation scenarios with varying global net-zero GHG emissions constraints, three addi-tional representative lower carbon extraction technologies available for the oil sands sector, as well as global direct air capture (DAC) deployment. We find that lower carbon technology deployment allows a 20%-44% increase in oil sands production by 2050 for scenarios with net-zero GHG emissions in 2100 or 2075. DAC helps maintain oil sands production in the most ambitious global decarbonization scenario (net-zero GHG by 2050), without which low international oil demand makes Canadian oil sands production uncompetitive. Canadian oil sands production thus depends highly on the availability of lower carbon extraction technologies and interna-tional oil demand, which to a certain extent relies on the availability and global deployment of negative emis-sions technologies.

This paper discusses the environmental impacts of the decarbonisation plan proposed by the Spanish Government, comparing the current situation with those foreseen for 2020 and 2030. Furthermore, climate change will vary the thermal demands of buildings. The paper thus investigates the heating and cooling demands of a type of single-family house located in eight Spanish cities with very different climates and altitude. The combined effects of the decarbonisation plan and climate change are analysed based on the environmental impacts caused by the electricity required to meet thermal demands. Both effects led to a reduction of the damage in the categories Human Health (59-68%), Climate Change (57-67%) and Resources (54-65%). However, the damage to Ecosystem Quality will increase (5-28%) as a result of the greater impact on this damage category from the energy production scenario for 2030, although thermal requirements in households will decrease.

However, it is not yet clear how these technologies can contribute to decarbonizing urban energy systems that are different in forms, building types, climate, culture, technical, and regulatory conditions. Therefore, we investigated the decarbonization potential of rooftop PV combined with EVs as batteries ( "PV + EV ") in five cases in Korea; four cities, and one province, from 2019 to 2030 using techno-economic analysis. We evaluated the energy, economic, and environmental performance of rooftop PV and EVs for the five built forms in Korea and different building types in Seoul. In addition, technical and regulatory variables (e.g., EV efficiency, feed-in-tariff, etc.) are optimized for multiple performances. The "PV + EV " system has been found to reduce CO2 emissions by up to 86% and energy costs by up to 51% within cities in Korea. In particular, residential buildings are found to have better performance in all aspects than those of other building types. This research provides governments and industries with urban decarbonization strategies and supports prioritization of the investment in suitable building types for the "PV + EV " system in a city.

J	Boston, A; Bongers, G				Boston, Andy; Bongers, Geoff			MEGS: Modelling energy and grid services to explore decarbonisation of power systems at lowest total system cost	ENERGY STRATEGY REVIEWS			English	Article						Electricity cost; Grid services; Decarbonisation; Power system model; Total system cost; Australian national electricity market	OF-THE-ART; RENEWABLE ENERGY; FLEXIBILITY REQUIREMENTS; ABATEMENT; STORAGE	Finding the generation mix with the lowest total system cost for deep levels of decarbonisation is critical for electricity consumers and taxpayers, who together need to cover the costs of the entire electricity system. MEGS is an electricity system scenario tool designed to explore options to approach the optimal mix for a particular decarbonisation target. A future system must also maintain system security and "keep the lights on". To ensure this, MEGS also models grid services, such as firm capacity, inertia and frequency response, ensuring that there are sufficient volumes of these balancing mechanisms available to the grid operator. MEGS has been validated against outturn generation data for the Australian National Electricity Market and has been used to explore the lowest cost frontier at high levels of decarbonisation.

In this context, Heat as a Service (HaaS) business models, which provide consumers with an agreed heating plan rather than simply paying for units of fuel, are receiving increased attention. This paper explores HaaS based on insights from facilitated group discussions with key stakeholders, and learning from HaaS trials, in the United Kingdom. Results identified evidence needs and research gaps related to: addressing issues of trust between consumers and suppliers, supportive policies, financing business models, and openness and interoperability of technology and data. Based on the findings, we propose policy and research recommendations to better understand the role of HaaS business models in decarbonization.

J	Hammond, GP				Hammond, Geoffrey P.			The UK industrial decarbonisation strategy revisited	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-ENERGY			English	Article						business; climate change; energy	EMISSIONS REDUCTION; ENERGY; CHALLENGES; TRANSITION; INSIGHTS; CEMENT; STEEL; IRON	Since 2010, successive UK governments have produced various strategies for industry to reduce carbon dioxide emissions ('decarbonise'). This paper scrutinises the most recent version that was published in March 2021: the Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy (IDS). It contrasts the policy content of the IDS with previous industrial roadmaps, action plans and strategies (including the Clean Growth Strategy of 2017). In addition, it compares the proposals in the IDS with the latest recommendations of the UK government's independent Climate Change Committee, as well as drawing on lessons learned from the techno-economic assessments published by the author and his collaborators for a number of key 'foundation industries'. The latter emit significant shares of UK industrial carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions: the iron and steel (similar to 25%), chemicals (similar to 19%), cement (similar to 8%), pulp and paper (similar to 6%) and glass (similar to 3%) sectors. They also produce about 28 Mt of materials per year, which are worth 52 pound billion to the UK economy, and account for-10% of UK total carbon dioxide emissions.

J	Xu, JP; Zhao, CD; Wang, FJ; Yang, GC				Xu, Jiuping; Zhao, Chuandang; Wang, Fengjuan; Yang, Guocan			Industrial decarbonisation oriented distributed renewable generation towards wastewater treatment sector: Case from the Yangtze River Delta region in China	ENERGY			English	Article						Energy decarbonisation; Distributed renewable generation; Wastewater treatment plants; Multi-objective optimisation; Treatment scale	POWER-GENERATION; WIND ENERGY; TREATMENT-PLANT; SOLAR POWER; GAS; EFFICIENCY; SYSTEMS; COST; PV	Using the floor area in the wastewater treatment sector to deploy distributed renewable energy is economical and can assist in industrial decarbonisation; however, little attention has been paid to study of the ideal capacity. This study proposes a grid-connected wind-solar-storage system scheme for retrofitting existing wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and explores its regional potential. Seven treatment scales of WWTPs are classified, and the electricity consumption and available layout areas are estimated using fuzzy numbers. A multi-objective model with economic, technological, and environmental considerations is built and then solved using the e-constraint method. A case study in the Yangtze River Delta region in China is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results show that the installed capacity is 5.9 GWand that the levelized cost of electricity in the seven categories reflects a 'V' shape. The regression equations of the optimal potential, treatment scale, and layout area are identified. Further, scenarios in which export to the main grid is permitted and not permitted are discussed, and a four-step implementation strategy is proposed. This study provides an effective method for governments to improve space utilisation and energy decarbonisation in the industrial sector. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

At the end of 2020, the Chinese government announced a revised policy that will see the country attain carbon neutrality by 2060 and peak emission by 2030. This study aims to determine the techno-economic requirements for net-zero emission attainment in China. The models created are used to explicate the 100% integration of renewable energy into the energy systems in a Province in China considering the years 2030 and 2050. This study is novel as it aggregates the detailed requirements of all the energy sectors and the government policies for the case study. While the approach presented in this paper is applied specifically to Sichuan Province, China, the application of this method is limitless as it is vast and viable for other countries. This study can also serve as a template for many high carbon-emitting countries with sizeable RE potential. The total energy demand in the case study is summarized under three sectors; electricity, industry, and transport. Following the government policies, renewable energy sources such as wind power, solar PV, river hydro, and biomass are considered for 100% decarbonization of the case study. River hydro being the pre -dominant renewable energy source in this region is constructed considering three levels of hydro (dry, normal, and wet) years. The 2017 energy demand and supply data are first used to develop/validate the model on the EnergyPLAN simulation platform, then the 2030 proposed pathway to peak carbon emission by the government is analyzed. Three innovative pathways to net-zero emission attainment by 2050 are proposed in this study considering the additional use of biomass (BIO model), pumped hydro storage (EES model), and the import of clean electricity from neighboring provinces (IMP model). Based on the analyses in this study, the proposed pathway by the government cannot achieve net-zero emission by 2050, however, the three optimized strategies/ models presented in this study show a clearer and faster path to decarbonization. Carbon emission will reduce by 13.26 %, 14.77%, and 15.3 % between 2030 and 2050 reference models for the dry, normal, and wet year scenarios respectively. From the three optimization models, the total cost of the import model was the lowest under different scenarios. Therefore, the economic feasibility of this approach proves the superiority of the import model in terms of economic benefits.

To date, fuel switching has arisen as the most readily operational strategy, and its application in the cement sector is expected in the short to midterm. However, around two-thirds of the cement CO2 emissions come from the calcination of limestone. The implementation of CO2 capture utilization and/or storage will be crucial to support a reliable net-zero carbon future by 2050-2070. CCS is considered as the most carbon-neutral technology in the cement decarbonization roadmap, while CO2 recycling (CCU) has arisen as a suitable strategy for those locations where there is an industrial symbiosis between the cement market and CO2-based chemical markets (e.g., methanol, formic acid, etc.). Despite that the CCU strategy cannot be carbon-neutral by itself, it could be a powerful option in combination with CCS. To date, most CO2 recycling technologies are still emerging, and their development has to be boosted in the next decades. In this study, a prospective environmental analysis has been conducted through life cycle thinking to explore the benefits of cement long-term decarbonization by implementing a carbon recycling plant (CRP) based on the emerging electrochemical reduction (ER) of CO2 to produce methanol (MeOH). The study aims to demonstrate the synergic decarbonization and defossilization for both cement and MeOH markets, respectively. Cell energy efficiency and MeOH concentration have been identified as the key performance parameters that should be around 60% and 40% wt, respectively, to ensure a future sustainable implementation of ER to the MeOH technology. A CRP powered by low-carbon renewable electricity (<0.02 kg CO2eq/kW h) and with a low-fossil depletion (FD) impact (<0.01 kg oil(eq)/kW h) could lead to an integrated cement and MeOH production with sharp reductions in the carbon footprint (similar to 75%) and FD (similar to 66%) of the integrated cement and MeOH production compared to the conventional fossil-based productions. The proposed CO2 recycling scheme can contribute to accelerating the innovation of carbon capture and recycling technologies and their deployment in these hard-to-abate sectors.

It has become a considerable concern for local governments and practitioners to develop a regionally appropriate pathway to reduce emissions based on their resources and social development needs. Taking Guizhou Province as an example, this study aims to determine the resource allocation and techno-economic path of each sector in the energy system to 2050 under the low-carbon policies. Taking the policy target or total carbon emissions as the boundary condition, this paper depicts four potential decarbonization scenarios through a multi-sectoral open-source global energy system model. To accommodate provincial energy systems with a higher geographical resolution, the model proposed in this paper considers the ramping constraints of base-load units and increases the optimization step size to the hourly level. In addition, a quantitative assessment of the existing barriers to the low -carbon transition of the Guizhou provincial energy system and the role of flexible decarbonization technologies are presented. Results show that the model proposed in this paper can accurately reflect the actual situation of Guizhou Province and significantly improve the sensitivity. Based on the analyses in this study, the policy scenario does not allow Guizhou province to meet the national climate target. In contrast, the other three scenarios show clearer and rapider emission reduction options. Compared to the policy scenario (PS), the investment cost increases to 26.3%, 38.3%, and 112.7% for the accelerated transition scenario (ATS), 2 degrees C, and 1.5 degrees C scenario, with a 24.7%, 35.2%, and 74.6% reduction in total emissions, respectively, indicating that a decarbonization pathway that combines ATS and 2 degrees C scenarios is the most appropriate way to balance economic and emission reduction benefits. This way calls for the status quo year to immediately begin deploying emission reductions, accelerating renewable energy development, and deploying appropriately affordable carbon capture and storage (CCS) and energy storage.

The international community is actively promoting the idea of decarbonization, which implies a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. Although the current level of technology development does not allow abandoning the use of traditional energy sources, a general Western European tendency has already emerged to gradually abandon coal energy, driving the coal industry into another deep crisis. Coal mining is at the heart of the economic and social development of Asturias, and the miners' labor movement was the main social and political pillar of the region throughout the 20th century. Industrial disputes with mining companies and the government, high-profile miners' strikes and radicalism as an important component of the professional identity of miners around the world throughout the 20th century, have created the mythological image of the radical miner. This is the most militant segment of the labor movement, and the influence of the miners' trade unions has turned miners into leaders of leftist movements in many countries. The difficult and dangerous nature of work in an unfavorable environment connects the world history of coal mining with the trade union organizations of miners, the development of mining culture, which at the present time is already considered as an intangible heritage, and since the last third of the 20th century, with the corporate social responsibility of mining companies. Using the method of media analysis, a study of the current situation in the coal industry of Asturias and the vitality of the myth about the radical miner was carried out. Undoubtedly, decarbonization complicates the situation in the coal industry, but the task of the trade unions is precisely to minimize risks for people, to increase the possibility of maintaining wages, retraining, and finding new jobs. Drawing the attention of the state to these problems can help prevent social explosions and harmonize relations in society. But in modern conditions, miners, whose future is ambiguous, no longer possess that mythologized vital force, as it was in the 20th century, but rather depend on the efficiency of communications of the state, mining companies and trade unions.

However, there exists great disparity in previous studies on the effectiveness and suitability of renewable energy policies in abating carbon emissions. This study employs a dynamic general equilibrium model and assesses the effectiveness and trade-offs of renewable energy policies in achieving the dual decarbonization goals by 2060 in China. These policies include carbon market (CRP), the reduction of feed-in tariffs (FIT), the reduction of fossil fuel subsidies (FSB), the reduction of renewable energy costs (REC), resource taxes (RTX), and renewable portfolio standards (REP) as well as the mix of these policies. We find that renewable energy policies together could abate China's CO2 emissions in 2060 by 2.57 billion tons, but their effectiveness is very different. The REC would have the greatest effectiveness in abating CO2 emissions, followed by REP and CRP. Renewable energy policies would cause relatively slight damage to China's GDP, with the exception of the REC (raising GDP by 1.1713%). Regarding trade-offs, most policies will sacrifice China's internal and external demand but benefit employment. Renewable energy policies will effectively promote the low-carbon transformation of China's energy structure.

The pandemic made necessary to give great attention in the economic recession and also to give emphasis on the decarbonisation of our economy. While the European Commission reaffirms its determination to move forward with the European Green Deal and announces a green recovery plan, many governments are rapidly putting in place public stimulus programmes to boost the economy and restore jobs. After years of rising CO2 emissions from road transport and the lack of investment in clean technologies, in the early 2020s an unprecedented growth in sales of zero and low emission cars was observed in the EU. The three main pillars for the success of e-mobility are the spread of electric vehicles, the carbonneutral production processes and the use of energy from renewable sources. The present work shows the usefulness of traffic simulation tools for the comparison of existing and future scenarios, paying particular attention to the variation of the percentage of electric vehicles in the fleet. More specifically, a specific emission model is being used in the case of a roundabout in the city of Rzeszow, Poland and the results underline the importance of preventive analysis for the implementation of optimal transport decarbonisation strategies, as well as they lay the groundwork for future research steps.

J	Spanner, MM; Wein, J				Spanner, Maximilian M.; Wein, Julia			Carbon risk real estate monitor: making decarbonisation in the real estate sector measurable	JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN REAL ESTATE RESEARCH			English	Article						Risk management; Commercial real estate; Science-based targets; Decarbonisation; Downscaling; Carbon risk; Stranding risk; Excess emissions	SEA-LEVEL RISE; LEED; IMPACT; CERTIFICATION; VULNERABILITY; ADAPTATION; BUILDINGS; LOSSES	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the functionality and effectiveness of the Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM tool). The aim of the project, supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, was to develop a broadly accepted tool that provides investors and other stakeholders with a sound basis for the assessment of stranding risks. Design/methodology/approach The tool calculates the annual carbon emissions (baseline emissions) of a given asset or portfolio and assesses the stranding risks, by making use of science-based decarbonisation pathways. To account for ongoing climate change, the tool considers the effects of grid decarbonisation, as well as the development of heating and cooling-degree days. Findings The paper provides property-specific carbon emission pathways, as well as valuable insight into state-of-the-art carbon risk assessment and management measures and thereby paves the way towards a low-carbon building stock. Further selected risk indicators at the asset (e.g. costs of greenhouse gas emissions) and aggregated levels (e.g. Carbon Value at Risk) are considered. Research limitations/implications The approach described in this paper can serve as a model for the realisation of an enhanced tool with respect to other countries, leading to a globally applicable instrument for assessing stranding risks in the commercial real estate sector. Practical implications The real estate industry is endangered by the downside risks of climate change, leading to potential monetary losses and write-downs. Accordingly, this approach enables stakeholders to assess the exposure of their assets to stranding risks, based on energy and emission data. Social implications The CRREM tool reduces investor uncertainty and offers a viable basis for investment decision-making with regard to stranding risks and retrofit planning. Originality/value The approach pioneers a way to provide investors with a profound stranding risk assessment based on science-based decarbonisation pathways.

An impact assessment of urban heat decarbonisation and low emission vehicle uptake on future UK energy system scenarios	RENEWABLE ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	27th European Biomass Conference and Exhibition (EUBCE)	MAY 27-30, 2019	Lisbon, PORTUGAL			Urban decarbonisation; 2050; Renewables; Future energy systems; UK	ELECTRICITY; STORAGE; COST	The UK government has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 80%, from 1990 levels, by 2050. Decarbonisation of transport and heat supply to buildings is recognised as a fundamental step in achieving this target. With cities being the largest producers of GHG emissions they provide the biggest opportunity for climate change mitigation. Two contrasting visions of a 2050 target-compliant scenario are evaluated against each other. One is based on a high penetration of nuclear power and renewables the other based on predominantly gas with carbon capture storage (CCS). An impact assessment is carried out on both scenarios to understand how each scenario might perform over 4 evaluation criteria. The evaluation criteria provide insight into each scenario regarding; guaranteeing security of supply, scenario cost, sustainability and how feasible it is to deploy the chosen technologies. Whilst both scenarios raise discussion points on the feasibility of deploying certain technologies the more favourable scenario, in terms of the study results, is the nuclear and renewables option. The renewable energy generating technologies included as part of the study from largest to smallest in terms of capacity - are wind, solar photovoltaic, tidal and river hydro. The outputs of this study provide an important contribution to academic debate on what might be the most effective approach to achieving the 2050 decarbonisation target. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Advancing bipartisan decarbonization policies: lessons from state-level successes and failures	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Political polarization; Climate change; Climate policy; Environmental politics	IDEOLOGY; POLARIZATION	U.S. political polarization is at a high point since the Civil War, and is a significant barrier to coordinated national action addressing climate change. To examine where common ground may exist, here we comprehensively review and characterize successes and failures of recent state-level decarbonization legislation, focusing especially on bipartisanship. We analyze 418 major state-government-enacted bills and 450 failed bills from 2015 to 2020, as well as the political contexts in which they were passed or defeated. We use bivariate analyses and regressions to explore correlations and partial correlations between the policy characteristics and political contexts of bills, and their passage or failure, their bipartisanship, and vote shares they received. Key results include (i) nearly one-third of these state-level decarbonization bills were passed by Republican-controlled governments. (ii) Bipartisan or Republican co-sponsors disproportionately passed financial incentives for renewable energy, and legislation that expands consumer or business choices in context of decarbonization goals; Democrat-only co-sponsors disproportionately passed bills that restricted consumer and business choice, such as mandatory Renewable Energy and Efficiency Portfolio Standards (REEPS) and emissions standards. (iii) Bipartisan bills were disproportionately proposed in "divided" states, did not restrict consumer and business choice, had environmental justice components framed economically, and lacked environmental justice components framed either using academic social-justice jargon or non-neutrally with respect to immutable characteristics such as race. (iv) Bills that expand consumer or business choice were disproportionately enacted. Though climate change is a polarized issue, our results provide tangible insights for future bipartisan successes.

European Climate Action for 2020-2030 sets a long-term goal of achieving neutrality of greenhouse gas emissions and towards the end of 2019 the Spanish Government presented its Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan. It is of interest to the international audience to know how energy policies can affect decisions on building retrofitting to improve sustainability: reduction in energy consumption, climate change and other environmental impacts. A life cycle assessment was carried out for the retrofitting of the building envelope and different energy supply scenarios: only electricity from the electricity mix (scenario of reference that of 2018, and decarbonisation scenarios proposed for 2020 and 2030), and the installation of heat pump and photovoltaic panels. The impacts will decrease 40% for Global Warming Potential and 15% for Cumulative Energy Demand in 2030 with respect to the reference scenario. These reductions will further increase up to 54 and 61%, respectively, if photovoltaic panels and a heat pump are implemented.	[Gonzalez-Prieto, D.; Prieto, M.

J	Harlan, T				Harlan, Tyler			Conservation or Decarbonization? Small Hydropower and State Logics of Green Development in China	ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS			English	Article							SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; INTEGRATED CONSERVATION; PLANTATION FORESTRY; RENEWABLE ENERGY; ECO-CITY; CARBON; ACCUMULATION; POLITICS; URBAN; TERRITORIALIZATION	Through an analysis of small hydropower (SHP) in China, I argue that logics of green development offer a framework for analyzing why, how, and to what intended effect the state pursues different green agendas over time and space. For decades, China's central and provincial governments framed SHP as a model of green development, but in 2016 they instituted SHP restrictions due to ecological impacts and electricity waste, a situation blamed on local officials haphazardly approving too many plants. This interpretation, however, ignores a major shift in state logic for promoting SHP, first for conservation-based development in rural areas and then for low-carbon development in urban areas. These logics-which I abbreviate as conservation and decarbonization-are based on different political-economic problems that green development is meant to solve for the state, different places targeted for intervention, and different distributions of benefits and costs. Using this framework, I argue that a shift to decarbonization in the mid-2000s incentivized cash-strapped local governments in rural western China to build as many SHP plants as possible to export electricity and build local industries, leading to a subsequent "bust." I illustrate this trajectory using case studies of three prefectures in Yunnan province. This article thus enriches scholarship on state-nature relations by theorizing the role of the state in shaping dominant discourses and practices of green development across space and their uneven outcomes. Key Words: China, conservation, decarbonization, green development, renewable energy.

Assessing the most efficient routes to decarbonise these sectors requires an integrated view of energy and road transport systems. Here we describe how a national gas and electricity transmission network model was extended to represent multiple local energy systems and coupled with a national energy demand and road transport model. The integrated models were applied to assess a range of technologies and policies for heating and transport where the UK's 2050 net zero carbon emissions target is met. Overall, annual primary energy use is projected to reduce by between 25% and 50% by 2050 compared to 2015, due to ambitious efficiency improvements within homes and vehicles. However, both annual and peak electricity demands in 2050 are more than double compared with 2015. Managed electric vehicle charging could save 14TWh/year in gas-fired power generation at peak times, and associated emissions, whilst vehicle-to-grid services could provide 10GW of electricity supply during peak hours. Together, managed vehicle charging, and vehicle-to-grid supplies could result in a 16% reduction in total annual energy costs. The provision of fast public charging facilities could reduce peak electricity demand by 17GW and save an estimated 650 pound million annually. Although using hydrogen for heating and transport spreads the hydrogen network costs between homeowners and motorists, it is still estimated to be more costly overall compared to an all-electric scenario. Bio-energy electricity generation plants with carbon capture and storage are required to drive overall energy system emissions to net zero, utilisation of which is lowest when heating is electrified, and road transport consists of a mix of electric and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles. The analysis demonstrates the need for an integrated systems approach to energy and transport policies and for coordination between national and local governments.

J	Jia, QX				Jia, Qingxian			The impact of green finance on the level of decarbonization of the economies: An analysis of the United States', China's, and Russia's current agenda	BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT			English	Article; Early Access						carbon intensity; carbon neutrality; climate change; decarbonization; green bonds; green finance sustainable development		With growing global concern for mainstreaming of environmental protection measures, the promotion of climate change and sustainable development policies, the international community, represented by international organizations, research institutions, and world-wide businesses, has focused on green finance. Existing research on green finance in the context of environmental trends has been reviewed in terms of the products and determinants of green finance. This study aims to assess the impact of green finance on the decarbonization of economies in the context of a review of current and potential problems and prospects. Based on the examples of the People's Republic of China, the Russian Federation, and the United States of America, the study suggests that today green finance has not yet demonstrated a tangible effect in these countries. Based on the results of the study, it can be argued that in the three countries, the main tool of green finance in the field of decarbonization is green bonds; other types of green finance are used to a limited extent. The progress of the United States and China is not so obvious, but based on the overall involvement of relevant government agencies and businesses in the green bond market, it can be assumed that the results will be observed in the near future.

J	Kiuila, O				Kiuila, Olga			Decarbonisation perspectives for the Polish economy	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Computable general equilibrium modeling; Dynamics; Energy technologies	GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM-MODELS; IMPACTS; ENERGY	In the coming decades the energy sector in Poland will undergo a substantial transition towards low carbon usage, which will have a predominant impact on the economy. Several modernization scenarios for energy policy are currently being discussed by the government and not yet concluded. The main objective of this paper is to provide a tool that allows to simulate such scenarios and to show the impact of decarbonisation on the whole economy. We propose an intertemporal hybrid general equilibrium modeling that incorporates energy technologies (bottom-up approach) directly into a macroeconomic structure (top-down approach). By accounting for wide adjustments in the economy, while controlling for all major constraints, the model gives a unique and detailed insight into the future shape of the energy sector and prospects of low carbon economy in Poland. Our simulation results suggest that there are no free lunches. No realistic energy mix allows to achieve sustainable positive economic growth when considerable emission reduction is to be achieved. The price on CO2 will exceed EUR 100 for 30% emission reduction with respect to business-as-usual scenario. Gradual phase-out of coal requires focusing on biomass technology (the first best), nuclear and wind power (the second best).

A detailed modeling of different forest-based bioenergy pathways is provided following a techno-economic (bottom-up) approach. As an illustration, these pathways are implemented in NATEM-Que ' bec, a detailed bottom-up energy model for Que ' bec, Canada. It is the first time different primary and secondary forestbased bioenergy technologies are being modeled in such a detailed bottom-up energy system model like TIMES. A detailed analysis of forest-based bioenergy potential in Quebec is also provided under different greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction scenarios. Main insights are as follows. The transportation sector is the primary contributor to GHG emissions over the time horizon in all scenarios, except for the most stringent GHG reduction scenario (GHGB) in 2050. The industrial sector is the main emitter by 2050 in GHGB, indicating the difficulties to decarbonize heavy industry. Furthermore, an extensive electrification is required to reach the GHG reduction targets. The bioenergy share is expected to increase considerably in the transportation and industrial sectors, cutting down on the need to reduce GHG emissions. Forest-based bioenergies such as cellulosic bioethanol, biobased heat, FT diesel and electricity as a co-product can effectively support this energy transition. The present study discerns forest-based bioenergies as an attainable decarbonization pathway for the province of Quebec and envisages a greater penetration of bioenergy than in the 2030 Plan for a Green Economy proposed by the government of Que ' bec. Other world regions with a declining trend for traditional forest products should also consider such a strategy.

J	Leffel, B				Leffel, Benjamin			Climate consultants and complementarity: Local procurement, green industry and decarbonization in Australia, Singapore, and the United States	ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Eco-state restructuring; Expertise; Climate change; Green industry; Energy performance contract; Procurement	ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; ENERGY TRANSITIONS; OFFSHORE WIND; POLICY MIXES; URBAN; MARKET; CITY; RECONFIGURATION; ADAPTATION	Private climate expertise matters for the local political economy of urban climate governance. City climate policy often pairs decarbonization efforts with investment into the growth of local "green industries", seeking complementarity between environmental and economic goals. Underappreciated is that this pairing is increasingly achieved by local government purchasing of decarbonization services directly from private expertise within local green industries. This involves local government procurement of climate mitigation services from local environmental services firms, where service delivery facilitates greenhouse gas emissions reduction, while the local nature of procurement generates new growth in existing green industries. By these means, local governments can achieve both decarbonization and local green industry growth goals with the same policy stroke. Three case studies of this strategy in Singapore, Knoxville (USA) and Melbourne (Australia) between 2005 and 2012 are examined in detail. This study contributes new evidence of the role of local procurement in the process of eco-state restructuring, a concept which describes a more active role of the state in negotiating environmental and economic interests in climate change governance.

We develop and implement a framework to systematically review and synthesize the impact of ten types of decarbonization policy instruments on seven technical and socioeconomic outcomes. Our systematic review shows that the selected types of regulatory and economic and financial instruments are generally associated with positive impacts on environmental, technological and innovation outcomes. Several instruments are often associated with short-term negative impacts on competitiveness and distributional outcomes. We discuss how these trade-offs can be reduced or transformed into co-benefits by designing research and development and government procurement, deployment policies, carbon pricing and trading. We show how specific design features can promote competitiveness and reduce negative distributional impacts, particularly for small firms. An online interactive Decarbonisation Policy Evaluation Tool allows further analysis of the evidence.

The rise of demand-side resources is occurring alongside the efforts to decarbonize grids. The confluence of these two trends has motivated research on the role of demand-side resources in grid decarbonization. Here, we synthesize the demand-side resource literature to develop a coherent and realistic vision for that role. We find that demand-side resources can supplement supply-side approaches to decarbonize grids more quickly and cost effectively. The role of demand-side resources is secondary to that of supply-side resources, and a critical analysis of tradeoffs is required whenever demand-side solutions substitute for supply-side solutions. Nonetheless, our review suggests that demand-side solutions can play a meaningful role, providing around 10%-30% of the resources required for deep decarbonization in domains such as energy, peak capacity, and deployed solar capacity. However, demand-side resources remain underutilized due to several solvable barriers. The urgency imposed by climate change requires that these barriers be addressed to fully realize the demand- side resource opportunity.

Meanwhile, Deep Energy Retrofitting (DER) has been recognised as a pivotal strategy towards building decarbonisation, offering tremendous benefits in reducing energy consumption, tackling climate change, and enhancing residents' comfort and well-being. However, hurdles for the massive market uptake of DER exist with relatively low cost-effectiveness, limited retrofit funding/ government incentives and low end-user motivations. This paper adopts a holistic approach to evaluate and compare two retrofit strategies: Holistic-decarbonised Electrification Retrofit (HER) VS DER from the perspectives of costs, carbon, grid stability and overheating potentials. A 1940s British post-war dwelling with initial energy consumption of 396.6 kWh/m(2) is chosen as the case study to perform the analysis. This research also brings forward three load shifting strategies (i.e. fabric thermal insulation, renewables and battery storage) and investigates their impacts on enhancing grid stability and security. Results reveal that adopting the HER strategy can reduce lifetime carbon emissions up to 99%, higher than that from the DER strategy (i.e. 78%). From the ROI perspective, the HER strategy is more attractive than the DER strategy, with an initial investment of 184 pound/m(2) and a payback period of 14 years. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This study constructed a tripartite game model of urban DDT under the vision of carbon neutrality from the perspective of embedded participation of multiple subjects, analyzed the behavior strategy choice of relevant subjects and its evolution process by using the evolutionary game approach, and further simulated the influence of four types of driving policies on the system evolution by using Matlab software. The main findings are as follows. (1) The stable equilibrium point of stakeholders' behavioral strategies (e.g., active participation or limited participation) in the urban DDT process was influenced not only by their strategic tendencies, but also by the behavioral strategies of other relevant groups (2) Changes in stakeholders' initial willingness (i.e., the probability of choosing a particular strategy at the beginning). significantly affected the evolutionary trajectory of stakeholders' behavioral strategies in the urban DDT process. The evolutionary trajectory of the government's stabilization strategy under the low initial willingness scenario showed a tendency to evolve first toward an active guidance strategy and then gradually toward a limited guidance strategy. (3) Both subsidy and penalty policies had significant positive effects on enterprises' evolutionary trajectories, but their effects differed. The increase of policy subsidies could continuously push enterprises to converge to a stable strategy, while the in-crease of regulatory fines could push enterprises to converge to a stable strategy in the early stage of system evolution, and then the push effect gradually decreases. (4) Participation incentive policies and emission compensation policies affect the evolutionary trajectory of the behavioral strategies of the government and the public. When participation incentives increase, the government and the public would converge to the stabili-zation strategy quickly. Finally, targeted policy recommendations were made in order to provide reference for the government to formulate effective DDT policies.

Prospects for Using Hydrogen in Various Branches of the World Economy as One of the Directions of Its Decarbonization	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF APPLIED CHEMISTRY			English	Review						hydrogen; steam methane conversion; water electrolysis; carbon dioxide emission; decarbonization of economy	FUEL-CELL; ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE; WIND ENERGY; AMMONIA; STORAGE; TECHNOLOGIES; CHALLENGES; EMISSIONS; PART	The review deals with the state of the art and prospects for using hydrogen in various branches of the world economy: in industry (oil-refining, chemical, steel-casting, cement), on transport (road, railway, maritime, aviation), and in production and distribution of the electric and thermal power. Using hydrogen is one of efficient directions of the economy decarbonization. The possibility and efficiency of using hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, and synthetic kerosene as a fuel for internal combustion engines and gas turbines in various kinds of vehicles and in production of the electric and thermal power are evaluated. The need for long-term hydrogen storage for reducing the influence exerted on the operation of electric networks by seasonal variations in the electric power production from renewable sources is demonstrated, and the hydrogen storage methods are considered. The feasibility of various procedures for utilizing CO2 formed in the course of hydrogen production by steam methane conversion at industrial enterprises using hydrogen for their own needs are analyzed.

First, a review of the field looks at prior work highlighting metrics and goals for decarbonization. We next provide a synthesis of material obstacles and opportunities within this industry sector. Then, based on an understanding of the field, we utilize scenario planning to understand "how can we plan for decarbonizing the agricultural industry in the US in the next 10 to 25 years?" To help answer this question, we identify and rank drivers of change, uncertainty, and impact of these drivers. We then demonstrate how this industry's decision-makers can plan for pathways while navigating obstacles and opportunities to an uncertain future. Finally, we identify four scenarios providing plausible pathways to a future that is different from business as usual and able to generate trillions of dollars of value across industries. The study is with a call to action for decision makers to put this industry on a different path than it has been on for the last 100 years. We see opportunities for researchers to conduct more studies on emission policies, valuing CO2 emissions, along with investments in infrastructure, public-private partnerships, and government incentives for decarbonization in the context of applying scenario planning across industries.

Decarbonization pathways for the residential sector in the United States	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article							ENERGY SUFFICIENCY; CARBON FOOTPRINT; EFFICIENCY; DEMOLITION; BUILDINGS; DEMAND; SYSTEM; POLICY	Residential GHG emissions in the United States are driven in part by a housing stock where onsite fossil combustion is common, home sizes are large by international standards, energy efficiency potential is large and electricity generation in many regions is GHG intensive. In this analysis, we assess decarbonization pathways for the US residential sector to 2060, through 108 scenarios describing housing stock evolution, new housing characteristics, renovation levels and clean electricity. The lowest emission pathways involve very rapid decarbonization of electricity supply alongside extensive renovations to existing homes, including improving thermal envelopes and heat pump electrification of heating. Reducing the size and increasing the electrification of new homes provide further emission cuts and combining all strategies enables reductions of 91% between 2020 and 2050. The potential of individual mitigation strategies shows great regional variation. Reaching zero emissions will require simultaneous deployment of multiple strategies and greater reduction of embodied emissions. Residential sector decarbonization is an essential part of mitigation, especially in the United States where per capita energy use is high by global standards. This article shows the emission reduction potential from individual and combined strategies applied to existing and new homes and to electricity supply.

J	Finon, D				Finon, Dominique			The transition of the electricity system towards decarbonization: the need for change in the market regime	CLIMATE POLICY			English	Article						clean energy obligation; decarbonization; electricity system; feed-in tariffs; low-carbon technology; market coordination; public coordination; renewable energy		The mainstream community of energy experts is not aware of the long-term impacts that carbon policies directly concerned with promoting the development of low-carbon technologies produce on the electricity market regime. Long-term market coordination should be replaced by public coordination with long-term arrangements. The current market coordination makes carbon pricing ineffective in orienting investors towards capital-intensive low-carbon technologies. Fossil fuel generation technologies are preferred because their investment risks are much lower in the market regime, even with a high but unstable carbon price. Thus, in order to avoid delaying investment that is aimed at the decarbonization of the electricity system, a number of new market arrangements that lower the investment risk of low-carbon technologies and provide output-based subsidization have or are being selected by governments. As the use of low-carbon equipment to produce electricity develops, long-term market coordination for other technologies (e.g. peaking units, combined cycle gas turbine) will fade away because they alter the market price setting. Thus it is likely that, in the future, public coordination and planning will replace the decisions of market players not only for low-carbon technologies but also for every other type of capacity development. Policy relevance The development of renewables as promoted by both feed-in tariffs and green certificate obligations, which answer to different market failures, is well known. Similar long-term arrangements, which both subsidize and de-risk low-carbon investments for every small-sized and large-sized technology, shift learning costs and risks onto consumers. Energy experts and regulators have ignored that the expansion and generalization of these arrangements are changing the coordination function of the electricity markets. Apart from those in the UK, they are still unaware of the impacts that such technology-focused policies produce on the electricity market regime. The transition from market coordination to public coordination, which is inconsistent with the market principles of European electricity legislation, and long-term contracting is inevitable and should be anticipated.

This is reflected in the COP26 Transport Declaration signed by 38 national governments, alongside city region governments, vehicle manufacturers and investors. However, emerging evidence suggests that EVs present multiple challenges for air quality, mobility and health, including risks from non-exhaust emissions (NEEs) and increasing reliance on vehicles for short trips. Understanding the interconnected links between electric mobility, human health and the environment, including synergies and trade-offs, requires a whole systems approach to transport policymaking. In the present paper, we describe the use of Participatory Systems Mapping (PSM) in which a diverse group of stakeholders collaboratively constructed a causal model of the U.K. surface transport system through a series of interactive online workshops. We present the map and its analysis, with our findings illustrating how unintended consequences of EV-focussed transport policies may have an impact on air quality, human health and important social functions of the transport system. We conclude by considering how online participatory causal modelling techniques could be effectively integrated with empirical metrics to facilitate effective policy design and appraisal in the transport sector.

This paper builds on various insights for a novel perspective: policy-driven, narrative-based evidence gathering. In a case study of UK priority setting for bioenergy innovation, documents and interviews were analysed to identify links between diagnoses of the problem, societal visions, policy narratives and evidence gathering. This process is illuminated by the theoretical concept of sociotechnical imaginaries-technoscientific projects which the state should promote for a feasible, desirable future. Results suggest that evidence has been selectively generated and gathered within a specific future vision, whereby bioenergy largely provides an input-substitute within the incumbent centralised infrastructure. Such evidence is attributed to an external expertise, thus helping to legitimise the policy framework. Evidence has helped to substantiate policy commitments to expand bioenergy. The dominant narrative has been reinforced by the government's multi-stake-holder consultation favouring the incumbent industry and by incentive structures for industry co-investment.

CLIMATE POLICY			English	Article						Climate policy; decarbonization; public policy; long-term strategies; UNFCCC	POLICY; DECARBONIZATION; POLITICS; CHINA	Since the Paris Agreement was adopted in 2015, both national and subnational governments have been encouraged to submit Mid-Century Strategies, outlining how they would reach their deep decarbonization goals. However, research on the design and potential of these strategies has been very limited. To address this shortcoming, here we assess 13 such strategies - six national, seven subnational - in a comparative fashion. We find that the energy-economy-climate models underpinning these strategies are generally of high quality, though national jurisdictions generally performed better. However, most strategies are not plausible without significant changes to policy, and the industrial sector in particular presents a major limitation. The strategies are helpful in revealing this gap, but much works remains to be done for plausible mid-century decarbonization trajectories to become a reality. We also find that public input and societal participation in strategy building were a double-edged sword depending on the constellation of domestic preferences. Governmental Mid-Century Strategies for deep decarbonization are underpinned by high-quality energy-economy-climate models Governments' proposed strategies require significant new policies, as even among jurisdictions that have an MCS, extant policies are insufficient to achieve deep decarbonization No jurisdiction studied has yet put forward a plausible decarbonization policy for the industrial sector. Public input and societal participation can be a double-edged sword: they can increase durability of the strategy but also enable opposing forces to mobilize against ambitious changes.

Analyzing potential scenarios for building decarbonization in different socioeconomic contexts is a crucial step to develop national and transnational roadmaps to achieve global emission reduction targets. This study integrates building stock energy models for 32 countries across four continents to create carbon emission mitigation reference scenarios and decarbonization scenarios by 2050, covering 60% of today's global building emissions. These decarbonization pathways are compared to those from global models. Results demonstrate that reference scenarios are in all countries insufficient to achieve substantial decarbonization and lead, in some regions, to significant increases, i.e., China and South America. Decarbonization scenarios lead to substantial carbon reductions within the range projected in the 2 degrees C scenario but are still insufficient to achieve the decarbonization goals under the 1.5 degrees C scenario. Building decarbonization has an important role to play in achieving global emissions reductions targets. Here the authors find that stated policy scenarios are insufficient to achieve building decarbonization goals globally, while ambitious decarbonization scenarios are still not sufficient to achieve goals under the 1.5 degrees C scenario.

In our basic scenario, the EU is supposed to complete the decarbonisation of the selected sectors in 30 years, whereas in the rest of the world these sectors will be 30% decarbonised. We hypothesise that emissions and employment will fall once renewable sources of energy replace fossil fuels. Yet, in the meanwhile, massive investments are needed to build the required infrastructure. To compute the full impact, we apply a multiplier-accelerator model to a global multiregional hybrid input-output table derived from EXIOBASE3. In the EU, such a decarbonisation reduces yearly energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and employment by 22%, 19%, and 4%, respectively. Thus, additional measures are necessary to avoid global warming and absorb unemployment.

A transition in the transport sector is seemingly inevitable considering these priorities. This study outlines some key socio-economic implications of a transition in South Africa's transport system, building on work previously done. The focus was on a rapid decarbonisation of the South African economy and the potential impacts of implementing efficiency improvements in the transport sector, including mode-switching. The overall finding was that a more ambitious decarbonisation target would have marginal impact on the economy relative to South Africa's nationally-determined contribution. It was further found that the implementation of efficiency improvements and changes in behaviour (decreased mileage, increased occupancy, increased rail use and increased use of public transport) could significantly reduce the burden on the economy of a higher GHG emission reduction target.

As with other developing countries, Malaysia's challenge is to decarbonize its energy-centric economy in the face of population growth pressures and substantial levels of poverty. Drawing on extensive interviews with both public and private stakeholders, we examine how Malaysia has launched its transition to a decarbonized development path. Based on our multi-year analysis, we identify key breakout factors, including behavioral transformations, institutional shifts, and action by a broad network of actors that have allowed Malaysia to begin decarbonizing its economy. At the same time, we note that federal-state friction, limited government capacity, the absence of a centralized management agency, the lack of international funding, incipient environmental awareness, and numerous barriers to investment in renewable energy reinforce carbon lock-in. Our analysis suggests ways in which other rapidly developing countries can learn from Malaysia's initial successes and challenges.

Here, we calculate the potential GHG mitigation of a UK national planting strategy of 30,000hayr(-1) from 2020 to 2050, using dynamic life cycle assessment. What-if scenarios vary: conifer-broadleaf composition, harvesting, product breakouts, and decarbonisation of substituted energy and materials, to estimate 100-year GHG mitigation. Here we find forest growth rate is the most important determinant of cumulative mitigation by 2120, irrespective of whether trees are harvested. A national planting strategy of commercial forest could mitigate 1.64 Pg CO(2)e by 2120 (cumulative), compared with 0.54-1.72 Pg CO(2)e for planting only conservation forests, depending on species composition. Even after heavy discounting of future product substitution credits based on industrial decarbonisation projections, GHG mitigation from harvested stands typically surpasses unharvested stands. Commercial afforestation can deliver effective GHG mitigation that is robust to future decarbonisation pathways and wood uses. Afforestation is an important greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation strategy but the efficacy of commercial (harvested) forestry is disputed. Here the authors apply dynamic life cycle assessment to show that new commercial conifer forests can achieve up to 269% more GHG mitigation than semi-natural forests, over 100 years.

Despite the theoretical attractions, it has become doubtful whether carbon markets by themselves can offer the desired solution. We address this question through an integrated modeling framework, stylized for the Great Britain (GB) power market within the EU ETS, which includes three distinct components: (a) long-term least-cost capacity planning, similar in functionality to many used in policy analysis, but innovative in providing the endogenous calculation of carbon prices; (b) short-term price risk analysis producing hourly dispatch and pricing outputs, which are used to test the annual financial performance metrics implied by the longer-term investments; and (c) agent-based computational learning to derive pricing behavior in imperfect markets. The results indicate that the risk/return profile of electricity markets may deteriorate substantially as a result of decarbonization, reducing the propensity of companies to invest in the absence of increased government support and/or more beneficial market circumstances. If allowed, markets may adjust by deferring investment until conditions improve, consolidating to increase market power, or operating in a tighter market with reduced spare capacity. To the extent that each of these "market-led" solutions may be politically unpalatable, policy design will need to sustain a delicate regulatory regime, moderating the possible increased market power of companies while maintaining low-carbon subsidies for longer than expected. This paper considers some of the modeling implications for this compromise.

Firstly, the effect of Waste Cooking Oil (WCO) co-hydroprocessing with Heavy Atmospheric Gas Oil (HAGO) at different relative ratios (100/0, 95/5, 90/10, 85/15, 80/20 and 70/30 v/v) was evaluated in terms of diesel quality. The experimental results showed explicitly that the addition of WCO did not limit any hydroprocessing reactions targeted. Particularly WCO integration led to a significant diesel content increase which reached 13% for the highest WCO content feedstock (30% v/v), while increasing hydrogen consumption. The study showed that co-hydroprocessing of residual lipids within a refinery can provide an effective and no-risk pathway for integrating residual liquid biomass in transportation fuels, without significant capital investments, while the addition of 5-10% v/v WCO in the hydroprocessing feedstock is considered optimal in terms of H-2 additional requirements (similar to 6.5%), product quality and WCO availability.

Feasibility analysis of a CO2 recycling plant for the decarbonization of formate and dihydroxyacetone production	GREEN CHEMISTRY			English	Article							GENERAL TECHNOECONOMIC ANALYSIS; LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; FORMIC-ACID; CARBON-DIOXIDE; ECONOMIC-ASSESSMENT; ELECTROCHEMICAL REDUCTION; GLYCEROL; ELECTROLYSIS; OXIDATION; CHEMICALS	Renewable-driven CO2 recycling plants (CO(2)RPs) to produce chemicals have a certain role to play in the decarbonization of the economy. In recent years, significant progress has been made in the decarbonization of chemicals such as formate/formic acid (HCOO-/HCOOH) by CO2 electrochemical reduction (CO2ER). The traditional approach consists of the cathodic CO2ER coupled to the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Current trends consist of alternative anodic processes, such as glycerol (GLY) electro-oxidation (EOG), as a powerful alternative to the OER because it can noticeably lower the cell voltage. Also, this recent alternative leads to the formation of products in the anode with more economic value than O-2, for example, the fine chemical dihydroxyacetone (DHA). Until now factors other than just the energy savings in the ER cell have been neglected. But these factors, such as the anodic market size, the downstream separation energy demand, etc., have to be contemplated in the whole decarbonization picture. In the present study, we analyze the environmental and economic benefits of the integrated production of HCOO- and DHA by a renewable-driven CO2RP in which the traditional OER is substituted by the EOG alternative. Life Cycle Thinking was used to support the decision-making. HCOO- and DHA fossil routes as well as the traditional decarbonization OER scheme (that decarbonized the amount of HCOO-) were used for benchmarking. The integrated production in the proposed CO2RP is highly limited by the small market size of DHA compared to that of HCOO- and also by the high energy requirements in the DHA purification step. Anodic DHA concentration over 1.5 wt% is compulsory in short-mid-term developments to achieve a positive decarbonization scenario wherein the integrated production of DHA and HCOO- is compared with the traditional route. A noticeable reduction in the market price of DHA would be possible with appropriate anode developments. In addition, we evaluate the influence of the renewable electricity market forecast in the economic figures of DHA and HCOO- produced by the co-electrolysis technology.

J	Lachapelle, E; MacNeil, R; Paterson, M				Lachapelle, Erick; MacNeil, Robert; Paterson, Matthew			The political economy of decarbonisation: from green energy "race' to green "division of labour'	NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY			English	Article							TECHNOLOGICAL TRANSITIONS; UNITED-STATES; INNOVATION; ENVIRONMENTALISM; CAPITALISM; VARIETIES; RISE	This paper aims to provide an addendum to the rapidly growing concept of a global green energy race' between major states. It argues that although this framing has been useful in underscoring important dynamics in the process of decarbonisation, its narrow focus on installed capacity obscures a much broader and more complex process at play. In particular, it overlooks the critical role played by states aggressively investing in R&D and export manufacturing in the renewable energy sector. The paper thus supplements the concept of a green energy race' with that of a green global division of labour', which sees the process of decarbonisation not exclusively as an effort by individual states to install renewables domestically, but rather as a collective and interdependent process by dozens of states, all striving in different ways to promote capital accumulation on their soil. The paper provides an overview of data covering innovation, manufacturing and deployment in the clean energy sector, and offers a theoretical analysis of the trends observed.

This work is the first to develop the Generalized Divisia Index Method with a matrix of 8 x 14 to identify fourteen factors and analyze the provincial carbon change (especially the decarbonization progress) in residential building operations from 2000 to 2018. It shows that: (1) The operational carbon emissions released by residential buildings increased during 2000-2018, with an average rate of 4.53 % per yr in 30 samples. Behind this, the most positive contributor is residential floor areas, while the most negative contributor is the share of household consumption expenditure in the gross domestic product. (2) The annual decarbonization of most provinces in northern China peaked before 2008, accounting for 4.70 mega-tons of carbon dioxide (MtCO(2)) per province per yr, and in central and eastern China mainly peaked in approximately 2014, accounting for 7.21 MtCO(2) per province per yr, and the annual decarbonization in southern China generally continued to grow. (3) High levels of decarbonization and decarbonization efficiency have been observed in northern and southwestern China, with 35.06 MtCO(2) per province of decarbonization and 7.05 % per province of efficiency in 2001-2018. Overall, this study improves the analytical method to assess the decarbonization of building operations, and it helps the governments investigate the building decarbonization potential to promote the schemes of carbon peak.

J	Li, FGN; Strachan, N				Li, Francis G. N.; Strachan, Neil			Take me to your leader: Using socio-technical energy transitions (STET) modelling to explore the role of actors in decarbonisation pathways	ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Socio-technical transitions; Energy modelling; Climate policy; Behaviour	LOW-CARBON; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SUSTAINABILITY TRANSITIONS; POLITICAL SUSTAINABILITY; TECHNOLOGICAL-CHANGE; BEHAVIORAL REALISM; ELECTRICITY SYSTEM; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; SOCIAL-INFLUENCE; CO2 EMISSIONS	Quantitative modelling analysis in support of national and global decarbonisation pathways has never been more important to achieving global climate stabilisation in line with the Paris Agreement. However, established equilibrium and optimisation models tend to radically simplify their depiction of societal and political/institutional actors. This can make them difficult to use for implementing specific energy and climate policies in the near term and aligning these with long term targets. Most energy systems analysis continues to pair such techno-economic models with entirely qualitative narratives about future political and societal developments. The result is that these critical factors often fade into the background in subsequent discourse. In this paper, we utilise BLUE - a leading socio-technical energy transition (STET) model of the United Kingdom's (UK) energy system - to capture elements of the heterogeneity, consistency and co-evolution of societal and political drivers. We focus specifically on exploring government-led and societally-led energy transitions and investigating the differences in their decarbonisation pathways and end states. Our modelling exercise finds that it is not who leads per se that is the most critical, but rather the level of the initial effort and subsequent commitment from both leader and follower actors that appears to regulate the pace at which decarbonisation pathways unfold. However, systemic inertia in all cases means that the deepest decarbonisation targets continue to appear very difficult to achieve.	[Li, Francis G.

To help understand how an electrified local energy system could contribute to this target and the associated cost, we develop a whole-system based local energy optimization (LEO) model. The model captures a series of state-of-the-art technologies including building fabric retrofit, battery storage, electro-mobility, electro-heating, demand response, distributed renewable, and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading. And the model enables trade-off assessment between cost and emissions minimization, compares two system operating modes, i.e., cost-oriented and grid-impact -oriented, and evaluates the impacts from weather risks and capital cost assumptions. A case study in Wales reveals (1) capital cost assumptions can lead up to 30.8 % overall cost difference of the local energy system; (2) operating the system in cost-oriented mode can save up to 5 % cost than in the grid-impact-oriented mode; (3) electro-heating by heat pumps has the highest priority among all investigated technologies. Overall, this study demonstrates how to design and operate a cost-efficient and electrified UK local energy system by the whole-system incorporation of near-term technical and business model advances towards a decarbonized future.

The case of South Korea	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Climate change; Decomposition analysis; Energy; Green growth; Policy evaluation; South Korea	DECOMPOSITION ANALYSIS; RENEWABLE ENERGY; EMISSIONS; SCENARIOS	The win win opportunities connected to green growth are appealing to academics and policy makers alike, but empirical evaluations about the effectiveness of green growth policies are still scattered. Taking South Korea as case study, which set up a highly ambitious green growth program in 2009, our research casts light on the extent to which the Korean Green Growth Strategy has been effective in decarbonizing the economy. Our methodology combines decomposition analysis and econometrics with a review of energy and climate policies, including related structural changes. On the short term (2008-2012), most of the drivers displayed an enhancing effect on CO2 emissions from fuel combustion, with GDP per capita being the strongest driver. From a historical perspective (1971-2012), findings reveal that important drivers, such as energy and CO2 intensity even worsened their effects during the first years under the Green Growth Strategy. Regression statistics revealed that GDP per capita was in fact the driver with the most explanatory power for CO2 emissions, followed by energy intensity. The Korean policy mix of modest government support to low-carbon energy technologies and a lack of complementary pricing policies did not deliver the targeted emissions reduction, at least in the short-term. Despite recent policy developments, i.e. the introduction of a renewable portfolio standard in 2012 and an emissions trading system in 2015, several key policy challenges for decarbonization remain.

This paper, Part I of a two part paper, describes the methodology used to develop the scenarios and outlines the motivations for the project. The study utilised a backcasting approach, applied in three phases. In phase one, a set of credible and consistent end-points that described a substantially decarbonised energy system in 2050 were generated and reviewed by stakeholders. In phase two, pathways were developed to achieve the transition to the desired end-point. The impacts of the scenarios were assessed in phase three, by means of a deliberative multi-criteria assessment framework. The scenarios to emerge from this process are elaborated in Part II, and conclusions drawn in relation to the feasibility of achieving the 60% target. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Emodi, NV; Wade, B; Rekker, S; Greig, C				Emodi, Nnaemeka Vincent; Wade, Belinda; Rekker, Saphira; Greig, Chris			A systematic review of barriers to greenfield investment in decarbonisation solutions	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS			English	Review						Greenfield; Barriers; Systematic literature review; Renewable energy; Energy finance	RENEWABLE ENERGY; BROWNFIELD REDEVELOPMENT; URBAN GREENSPACE; CHINESE; ACCEPTANCE; TRANSITION; MANAGEMENT; TYPOLOGY; POLICIES; SECTOR	To achieve climate goals, unprecedented amounts of new clean energy capacity need to be deployed at a rapid rate. Project finance is crucial to achieve clean energy (CE) capacity targets in order to rapidly decarbonise economies. However, current project finance commitments are far from sufficient, particularly in greenfield settings. To accelerate decarbonisation efforts therefore, it is essential to understand the barriers to CE financing in greenfield settings in order to guide public policy and to direct future research in the greenfield and crossborder investment literature. To date, few studies have focused on mobilising private capital to develop and build greenfield investments. This paper reviews recent literature to identify the barriers to CE investment focusing on greenfield renewable generation projects using a systematic quantitative review. A total of 45 studies published between 2010 and 2022 were included in the review. The results identified 36 barriers grouped into 7 categories: business/market; construction, technical and operational; environmental; financial; legal and ownership rights; policy and regulatory; and political and social barriers. Over the study period, environmental barriers declined the most, while construction, technical and operational, and political and social barrier categories increased significantly. Financial barriers were consistent throughout the years. Although these barriers are likely due to ineffective policy and immature CE investment in host countries, they provide insights for governments to boost greenfield investments and to develop local industry capacity and expertise. This paper also provides directions for future research and concludes with policy recommendations to address the barriers.

Since municipal cities are the bottom administrative level for drawing up development plans, it is necessary and important to conduct decarbonization pathway research on municipal energy systems (MESs). However, there is little research on decarbonization at the municipal level, and the impact of development paths in each forecast scenario is mostly based on expert evaluation and qualitative assessment. Therefore, this study established a complete decarbonization framework for MESs, including general research procedures, models, and a sustainable evaluation method. The models of energy consumption and carbon emission were adapted and improved for MESs. In order to quantitatively evaluate the energy system development for each scenario, we proposed an energy-economy-environment-security (3E-S) evaluation method, in which principal component analysis (PCA) was adopted for multi-criterion decision making. According to the analysis results of the case city in Guangdong, this evaluation method was proved to be an effective way to identify the factors that may influence coordinated development. By adjusting the relevant parameters and factors in the model, the optimal decarbonization pathway can be found to promote sustainable and coordinated development, thus helping government decision makers to quantitatively evaluate planning paths.

Decarbonization of cement production in a hydrogen economy	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Cement plant; Hydrogen economy; Oxy-combustion; Carbon capture; Oxygen transport model; Cost analysis	OXY-FUEL COMBUSTION; PORTLAND-CEMENT; CO2 CAPTURE; EMISSIONS; PLANT	The transition to net-zero emission energy systems creates synergistic opportunities across sectors. For example, fuel hydrogen production from water electrolysis generates by-product oxygen that could be used to reduce the cost of carbon capture and storage (CCS) essential in the decarbonization of clinker production in cement making. To assess this opportunity, a techno-economic assessment was carried out for the production of clinker using oxy-combustion in a natural gas-fueled plant coupled to CCS. Material and energy flows were assessed in a reference case for clinker production (oxygen from air, no CCS), and compared to oxy-combustion clinker production from either an air separation unit (ASU, 95% O2), or water electrolysis (100% O2), both coupled to CCS. Compared to the reference, air-combusted clinker plant, oxy-combustion increases thermal energy demand by 7% and electricity demand by 137% for ASU and 67% for electrolytic oxygen. The levelized cost of oxygen supply ranges from $49/tO2 for an on-site ASU to pipelined electrolytic O2 at $35/tO2 (200 km) or $13/t O2 (20 km). The cost of clinker for the reference plant without CCS increases linearly from $84/t clinker to $193/t clinker at a carbon price of $0/tCO2 to $150/tCO2, respectively. With oxy-combustion and CCS, the clinker production cost ranges from $119 to $122/t clinker, reflecting a breakeven carbon price of $39 to $53/tCO2 compared to the reference case. The lower cost for the electrolytic supply of by-product oxygen compared to ASU oxygen must be balanced against the reliability of supply, the pipeline transport distance and the charges that may be added by the hydrogen producer.

J	Cabral, RP; Bui, M; Mac Dowell, N				Cabral, Renato P.; Bui, Mai; Mac Dowell, Niall			A synergistic approach for the simultaneous decarbonisation of power and industry via bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL			English	Article						Oxy-combustion; Carbon capture and storage; BECCS; Techno-economic analysis; Negative CO2 emissions; NET; Bioenergy	OXY-FUEL COMBUSTION; FLUE-GAS COMPRESSION; OXYFUEL PILOT-PLANT; CO2 CAPTURE; TECHNOECONOMIC ANALYSIS; AIR SEPARATION; PURIFICATION UNITS; BIO-ENERGY; COAL; BIOMASS	There is a need for a rapid and large scale decarbonisation to reduce CO2 emissions by 45% within 12 years. Thus, we propose a method that accelerates decarbonisation across multiple sectors via a synergistic approach with bioenergy with CCS (BECCS), which is able to remove 740 kg(CO2) from air per MWh electricity generated. Industry is a hard-to-decarbonise sector which presents a unique set of challenges where, unlike the power sector, there are no obvious alternatives to CCS. One of these challenges is the significant variation of CO2 concentration, which directly influences CO2 capture costs, ranging from $10/t(CO2) to over $170/t(CO2) for high (95-99% CO2) and low CO2 concentration (4% CO2) applications, respectively. Re-purposing the existing coalfired power plant fleet into BECCS displaces CO2 emissions from coal-use and enables a just transition, i. e., avoiding job loss, providing a supportive economic framework that does not rely on government subsidies. Negative emissions generated from capturing and storing atmospheric CO2 can be converted into negative emission credits (NECs) and auctioned to hard-to-decarbonise sectors, thus providing another revenue stream to the power plant. A levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) between $70 and $100 per MWh can be achieved through auctioning NECs at $90-$135 per t(CO2). Offsetting the global industrial CO2 emissions of 9 Gt(CO2) would require 3000 BECCS plants under this framework. This approach could jumpstart industrial decarbonisation whilst giving this sector more time to develop new CCS technologies.

Calcination of pelletized iron ore raw material was experimentally examined, using the samples that save their initial structure within the temperature and heating rate ranges of the existing roasting conveyor-type machines. Appearance of essential temperature gradients in the examined samples was proved experimentally; it was connected with non-stationary heating conditions and thermal effects of carbonates dissociation reaction. These conditions and effects restrict possibility of use of the existing non-isothermal kinetic methods for determination of kind and parameters of kinetic equations. The relationship among heterogeneous endothermic transformations and thermal physical calcination conditions was revealed.	[Dli, M., I; Bobkov, V., I; Sokolov, A.

However as with most, if not all, of the human civilizations, increases in prosperity have accumulated significant environmental impacts that threaten to result in environmentally induced economic decline. A key part of the world's response to this challenge is to rapidly decarbonise economies, with options to achieve 60-80% improvements (i.e., in the order of Factor 5) in energy and water productivity now available and proven in every sector. Drawing upon the 2009 publication 'Factor 5', in this article we discuss how to realize such large-scale improvements, involving complexity beyond technical and process innovation. We begin by considering the concept of greenhouse gas stabilization trajectories that include reducing current greenhouse gas emissions to achieve a 'peaking' of global emissions, and subsequent 'tailing' of emissions to the desired endpoint in 'decarbonising' the economy. Temporal priorities given to peaking and tailing have significant implications for the mix of decarbonising solutions and the need for government and market assistance in causing them to be implemented, requiring careful consideration upfront. Within this context, we refer to a number of examples of Factor 5 style opportunities for energy productivity and decarbonization, and then discuss the need for critical economic contributions to take such success from examples to central mechanisms in decarbonizing the global economy.

J	Kannan, R; Strachan, N				Kannan, Ramachandran; Strachan, Neil			Modelling the UK residential energy sector under long-term decarbonisation scenarios: Comparison between energy systems and sectoral modelling approaches	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Residential sector; MARKAL; Energy system model; CO2 emissions	EMISSION REDUCTIONS; HOUSING STOCK; 60-PERCENT	The UK government has set a groundbreaking target of a 60% reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050. Scenario and modelling assessment of this stringent target consistently finds that all sectors need to contribute to emissions reductions. The UK residential sector accounts for around 30% of the total final energy use and more than one-quarter of CO2 emissions. This paper focuses on modelling of the residential sector in a system wide energy-economy models (UK MARKAL) and key UK sectoral housing stock models. The UK residential energy demand and CO2 emission from the both approaches are compared. In an energy system with 60% economy-wide CO2 reductions, the residential sector plays a commensurate role. Energy systems analysis finds this reduction is primarily driven by energy systems interactions notably decarbonisation of the power sector combined with increased appliance efficiency. The stock models find alternate decarbonisation pathways based on assumptions related to the future building stock and behavioural changes. The paper concludes with a discussion on the assumptions and drivers of emission reductions in different models of the residential energy sector. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Moreover, to support the ambitious economic growth targets, reliance on and consumption of fossil fuels are increasing by each passing year. With this circumstance, this study aims to analyze the key drivers of CO(2)emissions in Vietnam from 1990 to 2016 using the Kaya identity and decomposition method. Following this approach, CO(2)emissions have been decomposed into five effect categories comprising population, affluence, energy intensity, fuel mix, and emission intensity. As per the results, CO(2)emissions in Vietnam were mainly driven by rising affluence (58.5%) and changing fuel mix (33.2%) which have resulted from improved living standards, rapid industrial development, and higher fossil fuel consumption. Moreover, population (13.8%) and emission intensity (3.1%) exhibited a relatively lower impact on CO(2)emissions during 1990-2016. However, energy intensity (- 8.7%) was the only negative driver which has resulted in the slowdown of carbon emissions in Vietnam. Based on the analysis of energy policy development, the share of renewable energy resources was still quite low in the national energy mix with higher reliance on traditional fossil fuels (mainly coal and petroleum). Therefore, to make a transition towards low-carbon economic growth, significant improvements in energy efficiency and emission intensity are necessary together with national energy mix restructuring for low-carbon economic growth.

SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						airport operators; COVID-19; climate change; sustainability; climate change mitigation	INDUSTRY	COVID-19 has had wide-ranging impacts on organisations with the potential to disrupt efforts to decarbonise their operations. To understand how COVID-19 has affected the climate change mitigation strategies of Airport Operators (AOs), questionnaires and semi-structured interviews with Sustainability Managers were undertaken in late 2020 amidst a period of disruption. While all reported that COVID-19 impacted delivery of interventions and projects to mitigate climate change, the majority stated that it would not impact their long-term climate goals, such as Net Zero by 2050. The most popular climate change mitigation interventions AOs intend to deploy between now and 2030 are on-site renewables and Electric Vehicles and related infrastructure. Engineered carbon removal interventions were considered highly unlikely to be deployed in this timeframe, with potential implications for Net Zero decarbonisation pathways. Despite the severe impacts of COVID-19 on the sector, results indicate that AOs remain committed to decarbonisation, with climate change action remaining the key priority for airports. Given ongoing financial and resource constraints, AOs will need to explore new business models and partnerships and nurture collaborative approaches with other aviation stakeholders to not only maintain progress toward Net Zero but "build back better ".

J	Milton, A				Milton, Alannah			Visions of Electrification and Potential for Decarbonisation: The Absence of Ridesharing and Carsharing in Australia's Electric Vehicle Policy	ENVIRONMENTAL AND PLANNING LAW JOURNAL			English	Article							CAR; MOBILITY; TRANSPORT; MANAGEMENT; SERVICES; FLEET	Governments around the globe are giving electric vehicles the green light to decarbonise passenger transport. But not everyone proposes the same idea of how they should be integrated. In sustainable transport policy and scholarship, two distinct visions emerge: "conservative" mass private electric vehicle uptake and "progressive" shared and intermodal electric mobility. Despite the conservative vision currently guiding most approaches, there is increasing concern about its capacity to deliver the decarbonisation required to avoid worst case climate change scenarios. Concerns centre on the slow uptake of electric vehicles, their life-cycle emissions and their priority over more energy efficient forms of mobility such as public transport, cycling and walking. Consequently, the progressive vision has gained traction, with electric ridesharing and carsharing as a core focus. Prioritising these industries for electrification is anticipated to minimise uptake barriers and reduce transport emissions quicker. This article evaluates federal and New South Wales electric vehicle policies against the two visions to gauge their decarbonisation potential. I argue that by failing to explicitly consider the ridesharing and carsharing industries for electrification, current policy measures largely reflect the conservative vision, limiting their emissions reduction potential. Though some measures may indirectly support the ridesharing and carsharing industries to electrify, without imagining electric vehicles as part of a transformed mobility system, Australia takes a businessas-usual approach to electrification.											115	0	0	0	3	LAWBOOK CO LTD	PYRMONT	LEVEL 6, 19 HARRIS ST, PYRMONT, NSW 2009, AUSTRALIA	0813-300X			ENVIRON PLAN LAW J	Environ.

If the GHG emission continues to rise at the current pace, humanity will face severe consequences and reverse all the progress made. This paper, therefore, uses relevant data from 14 developing countries in Asia from 1990 to 2018 to examine the potential impact of environmental innovation on CO2 emissions by controlling globalization, urbanization, and economic growth. The number of environmental-related technology patents is used as a measure of environmental innovation. We employed a panel long-run regression model - FMOLS, PCSE, and FGLS to estimate the elasticity of CO2 emissions. For causal association among variables, we used Dumitrescu-Hurlin Granger causality tests. Our results show that renewable energy consumption and globalization have a significant impact in reducing CO2 emissions, while environmental technology innovations play a meager role in reducing emissions and only when economic growth support those type of investment. Furthermore, we found urbanization, oil consumption, and economic growth is detrimental to the environment, which is also evident in past studies. Therefore, countries should invest in renewable energy and environmental innovation aligned with the growth to reduce GHG emissions.

J	Pielke, RA				Pielke, Roger A., Jr.			Mamizu climate policy: an evaluation of Japanese carbon emissions reduction targets	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						climate policy; decarbonization; Japan; policy evaluation		This letter evaluates Japan's so-called 'Mamizu' climate policies proposed in mid-2009 in terms of the implied rates of decarbonization of the Japanese economy for short-term and long-term targets. The letter uses the Kaya identity to structure the evaluation, employing both a bottom up approach (based on projections of future Japanese population, economic growth, and technology) and a top down approach (deriving implied rates of decarbonization consistent with the targets and various rates of economic growth). Both approaches indicate that the Japanese economy would have to achieve rates of decarbonization of 2.6% to meet a 2020 target of reducing emissions by 15% below 2005 levels, and 5.0% to meet a 2050 target of an 80% reduction below 2005 levels. A target of 25% below 1990 emissions proposed by the opposition party (which subsequently formed a government following elections in August 2009) implies a rate of decarbonization of 4.6% annually to 2020. The letter argues that international criticism of Japanese Mamizu climate policy proposals as being too weak was unfounded, and if anything, the proposals may have been too ambitious. In either case, climate policy would be strengthened through the support of a diversity of approaches to decarbonization.

Increasing demand-side emission abatement efforts is one important area to pursue, yet there are significant barriers that must be overcome in order to realize its potential. We ask: What barriers may be hindering deep emissions reduction at the household level? What kinds of levers are available to achieve emission reductions? Based on an original and extensive qualitative dataset, our in-depth study of households in Bergen, Norway, shows that individuals perceive they are confronted with considerable individual, economic, and infrastructural barriers that prevent them from taking deep mitigation actions. Our results however also suggest that some barriers can be overcome with motivational levers such as the availability of more sustainable alternatives, support networks and by the positive emotions felt when having a positive impact on the environment. Other barriers are more difficult to overcome, pointing to the overarching lesson from our study that households will need to be forced or incentivized beyond voluntary efforts to achieve rapid and comprehensive decarbonization. The current policy approach, aimed mostly at nudging for voluntary mitigation actions, is wholly inadequate to achieve significant emission reductions. Our study indicates that households are open for increasingly including more "sticks" into climate policymaking. While there are significant challenges to individuals taking stronger mitigation action, these can be overcome by strengthening government policies targeting the patterns and, importantly, volumes of household consumption.

This work aims (i) to assess the environmental performance of the buildings and (ii) to evaluate the effect of electricity decarbonization on the dwellings' global warming potential (GWP). Three different future electricity mix scenarios have been used and compared to a static scenario where the current electricity mix remains constant. The LCA results of the static scenario reveal that applying passive-house standards could reduce the impact of dwellings while it does not necessarily provide a positive environmental outcome. The building operation phase contributed the most to the environmental impact, while negligible impact comes from the end-of-life stage. The electricity decarbonization leads to a significant reduction of GWP in all cases, with the highest value achieved for the passive house using the highest share of electricity, 58%-70% GWP reduction compared to the static scenario. Moreover, electricity decarbonization increases the relative share of the production stage to the overall building emission. Therefore, close attention should be paid to construction material selection in any effort aiming to achieve further environmental benefits. The buildings' environmental and operational energy performances were also compared to the RIBA 2030 Climate Challenge.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Carley, S				Carley, Sanya			Decarbonization of the US electricity sector: Are state energy policy portfolios the solution?	ENERGY ECONOMICS			English	Article						Electricity markets; Energy policy; Carbon dioxide; Climate policy	COST	State governments have taken the lead on U.S. energy and climate policy. It is not yet clear, however, whether state energy policy portfolios can generate results in a similar magnitude or manner to their presumed carbon mitigation potential. This article seeks to address this lack of policy evidence and contribute empirical insights on the carbon mitigation effects of state energy portfolios within the U.S. electricity sector. Using a dynamic, long-term electricity dispatch model with U.S. power plant, utility, and transmission and distribution data between 2010 and 2030, this analysis builds a series of state-level policy portfolio scenarios and performs a comparative scenario analysis. Results reveal that state policy portfolios have modest to minimal carbon mitigation effects in the long run if surrounding states do not adopt similar portfolios as well. The difference in decarbonization potential between isolated state policies and larger, more coordinated policy efforts is due in large part to carbon leakage, which is the export of carbon intensive fossil fuel-based electricity across state lines. Results also confirm that a carbon price of $50/metric ton CO(2)e can generate substantial carbon savings. Although both policy options - an energy policy portfolio or a carbon price - are effective at reducing carbon emissions in the present analysis, neither is as effective alone as when the two strategies are combined.

Since the Paris Agreement, countries have been encouraged to implement more strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to build resilience against climate change impacts in developing countries. This article presents a literature review on policies, regulations, and programs that represent economic incentives to promote alternatives to decarbonize maritime and inland waterway transport in sixteen countries, including Colombia. More than one hundred thirty sources of information were reviewed, including official portals of governments, port authorities and organizations, and scientific articles; therefore, the incentives found were grouped into three categories: project financing, differentiated port tariffs, and incentives to cover onshore power service fees. As a result of this review, it was found that differentiated port tariffs were the most common type of incentive. Finally, the specific case of Colombia was analyzed, which provides a deeper perspective of current policies and measures aimed at encouraging the decarbonization of waterborne transport and compares them with the international panorama.

J	Dodds, PE; McDowall, W				Dodds, Paul E.; McDowall, Will			The future of the UK gas network	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Gas network; Decarbonisation; MARKAL		The UK has an extensive natural gas pipeline network supplying 84% of homes. Previous studies of decarbonisation pathways using the UK MARKAL energy system model have concluded that the low-pressure gas networks should be mostly abandoned by 2050, yet most of the iron pipes near buildings are currently being replaced early for safety reasons. Our study suggests that this programme will not lock-in the use of gas in the long-term. We examine potential future uses of the gas network in the UK energy system using an improved version of UK MARKAL that introduces a number of decarbonisation options for the gas network including bio-methane, hydrogen injection to the natural gas and conversion of the network to deliver hydrogen. We conclude that hydrogen conversion is the only gas decarbonisation option that might enable the gas networks to continue supplying energy to most buildings in the long-term, from a cost-optimal perspective. There is an opportunity for the government to adopt a long-term strategy for the gas distribution networks that either curtails the iron mains replacement programme or alters it to prepare the network for hydrogen conversion; both options could substantially reduce the long-term cost of supplying heat to UK buildings.

Adoption of biofuels for marine shipping decarbonization: A long-term price and scalability assessment	BIOFUELS BIOPRODUCTS & BIOREFINING-BIOFPR			English	Article						biorefinery; decarbonization; marine biofuels; renewable energy; scalability; sustainability; techno-economic analysis	ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY IMPACTS; STRAIGHT VEGETABLE-OIL; SUPPLY-SYSTEM; BIOMASS; FUEL	This study assessed the long-term annual biofuel production capacity potential and price in the United States and shed light on the prospect of biofuel adoption for marine propulsion. A linear programming model was developed to assist the projections and provide insightful analyses. The projected long-term (2040) maximum annual capacity of biofuels in the United States is 245 million metric tons (Mt) or 65 billion gallons of heavy fuel oil gallon equivalent (HFOGE) when based on the median feedstock availability. Between 2022 (near-term) and 2040, the potential biofuel capacity increases by over 40%, attributed to increased feedstock availability. At a price range up to $500/t, biodiesel is the main product, and the annual capacity (12 Mt) is limited to feedstock availability constraints. Biodiesel and corn ethanol are the main biofuels at a price range up to $750/t. At a higher price point (above $750/t), the biofuel types and annual capacities increase substantially (218 Mt per year). Biofuels above this price include gasoline-, jet-, and diesel-range blendstocks, as well as bio-methanol, bio-propane, and biogas. This study concludes that the US domestic feedstock availability coupled with advanced conversion technologies can produce substantial amounts of biofuels to achieve a critical mass and be impactful as alternative marine fuels. There is also a need to improve the biofuel price for marine shipping adoption. Policies and economic incentives that provide temporary financial support would help facilitate maritime biofuel adoption. (c) 2022 Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC.

The climate goal of the Paris Agreement, to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels while pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C, requires global GHG emissions reach net-zero and probably negative by 2055-2080. Given the average economic lifetime of industrial facilities is 20 years or more, this indicates all new investment must be net-zero emitting by 2035-2060 or be compensated by negative emissions to guarantee GHG-neutrality. We argue, based on a sample portfolio of emerging and near commercial technologies for each sector (largely based on zero carbon electricity & heat sources, biomass and carbon capture, and catalogued in an accompanying database), that reducing energy intensive industrial GHG emissions to Paris Agreement compatible levels may not only be technically possible, but can be achieved with sufficient prioritization and policy effort. We then review policy options to drive innovation and investment in these technologies. From this we synthesize a preliminary integrated strategy for a managed transition with minimum stranded assets, unemployment, and social trauma that recognizes the competitive and globally traded nature of commodity production. The strategy includes: an initial policy commitment followed by a national and sectoral stakeholder driven pathway process to build commitment and identify opportunities based on local zero carbon resources; penetration of near-commercial technologies through increasing valuation of GHG material intensity through GHG pricing or tradable performance based regulations with protection for competitiveness and against carbon leakage; research and demand support for the output of pilot plants, including some combination of guaranteed above-market prices that decline with output and an increasing requirement for low carbon Inputs in government procurement; and finally, key supporting institutions.

J	Verastegui, F; Lorca, L; Negrete-Pincetic, M; Olivares, D				Verastegui, Felipe; Lorca, Alvaro; Negrete-Pincetic, Matias; Olivares, Daniel			Firewood heat electrification impacts in the Chilean power system	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Power systems planning; Heat electrification; Decarbonization; Firewood; Energy systems integration	DEEP DECARBONIZATION; ENERGY; SOUTH; SWITCH; MODEL; GAS	Chile presents an extended use of low-quality firewood for residential heating. This raises serious concerns, mainly related to health problems due to particulate emissions from firewood combustion. Several initiatives have been considered by the Chilean government to address this, including heat electrification goals. In addition, the Chilean power system is undergoing a decarbonization process. This paper analyzes the impacts of firewood heat electrification over the Chilean power system's decarbonization process until 2044, based on a capacity expansion planning model and an estimation of firewood heat demand, to account for major changes in load shape and spatial distribution. The results show that there is a large increase in the power system total cost (ranging from 5.6% to 19.4%), with flexibility requirements becoming larger in the south. Technologies that strongly depend on local resource availability, such as wind and concentrated solar power, present changes in their systemic value, altering the need for storage and flexibility. Also, aspects such as household insulation, electrification efficiency, and smart heating technologies would significantly impact the process in terms of cost reduction and optimal generation mix. The policy implications for the Chilean power system are presented, within the broader discussion of the overall firewood problem.

This work addresses the challenge of decarbonizing the HB process in a novel way as it, for the first time, presents a conceptual process integration with a supercritical CO2 Allam power cycle, therefore transforming gaseous CO2 emissions into a valuable side product in a form of liquid CO2. Detailed process design and flowsheet simulation using Aspen Plus (R) was used as a basis for scale-up and techno-economic assessment of two cases (electrical grid dependent and independent). The results indicated that using this process design NH3 production reaches profitability at scales larger than 2 ton h(-1) to 5.4 ton h(-1) and at current global NH3 prices, the cost of manufacturing decrease, due to scale-up stabilizes at similar to 30 ton h(-1). Finally, this novel process integration achieves a significant reduction in gaseous CO2 emissions (compared to conventional HB process) of 68 % to 96 %, which indicates great potential for economically feasible green NH3.

The concept of applying TCS to individual road transport is familiar to transport researchers as a measure to regulate congestion and reduce transport-related emissions. Yet, it is not a strategy currently being considered by policy makers in the UK, despite the electrification of the road vehicle fleet and the associated loss of tax revenue presenting a rare opportunity to alter the economic instruments, which apply to road traffic. We consider how transport researchers can capitalise on this unique moment in transport history to shape transport policy. Our study uses qualitative methods, including a thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with transport stakeholders and experts, in addition to a literature review and document analysis. Data analysis is inductive, permitting the formation of new ideas about the potential benefits of TCS and the barriers to the application of TCS to real-world policy. Building upon the results of TCS experiments and the results of our analysis, we propose a novel potential form of TCS combined with road pricing to maintain government revenue, which incentivises road users to decrease road vehicle kilometres travelled and reduce pollution and congestion. The proposal contributes to the discussion on the governance of road transport and taxation.

The evolution of narratives and networks relating to geographical clusters as niches for CCS in industrial decarbonisation is evaluated in relation to seven pillars supporting SLO. Evidence is drawn from a combination of cluster mapping, documentary analysis and stakeholder interviews to identify the wider contexts underpinning industrial decarbonisation, stakeholder networks, interaction and communication, critical narratives, the conditions for establishing trust and confidence, different scales of social licence and maintaining a SLO. The delivery of a sustainable industrial decarbonisation strategy will depend on multiple layers of social licence involving discourses at different scales and, potentially, for different systems (heat, transport, different industrial processes). Despite setbacks as a result of funding cancellations and changes to government policy, the UK is positioned to be at the forefront of CCS deployment. While there is a high ambition and a strong narrative from government of the urgency to accelerate projects involving CCS, clear coordinated strategy and funding frameworks are necessary to build confidence that UK policy is both compatible with net zero and economically viable.

However, the specific mechanisms to tackle the risk of carbon leakage and create an attractive environment for green investment are highly contested in the academic literature. Opposing perspectives regarding the appropriateness and desirability of government intervention in the economy result in different approaches to the decarbonisation of industrial processes. This research builds on existing academic knowledge in the fields of carbon leakage, induced innovation and government intervention to assess the effects of a carbon tax in the industrial cluster of the Port of Rotterdam within the context of a carbon tax on industrial GHG emissions proposed in the Dutch National Climate Agreement. The main finding of this study shows that investment leakage constitutes the main threat instead of carbon leakage in the face of a higher carbon price. Regarding the theory of induced innovation, limited abatement options are available for the industrial cluster and there is the need to scale up existing technologies. Lastly, to both tackle the risk of investment leakage and enhance the scaling up of low-carbon technologies, government intervention in the form of regulations, subsidies and enabling conditions is vital.

Feasibility and practical limits of full decarbonization of the electricity market with renewable energy: Application to the Spanish power sector	ENERGY			English	Article						Greenhouse gas emissions; Electricity mix; Multi-objective optimization; Genetic algorithm	GENERATION MIX; OPTIMIZATION; INTEGRATION; ALGORITHM; WIND	Electricity market decarbonization using renewable energies is essential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the identification of the optimum electrical mix for each country is a challenging and complex task because of the many boundary conditions that must be taken into account, thus demanding the use of advanced analysis and computing tools. This paper presents a methodology based on artificial intelligence developed for this purpose and the results obtained when applied to the specific case of the Spanish electricity market long-term decarbonization. It also shows how effective this methodology is to find the optimum electrical mix fulfilling previously defined objectives: 100% coverage of the demand while simultaneously minimizing the electricity cost and curtailments. Results show the significant barriers to achieve a 100% renewable electrical mix without excessive curtailments or installed power. The methodology described here is suitable for any other country and target objectives. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Singh, PK; Chudasama, H				Singh, Pramod K.; Chudasama, Harpalsinh			Conceptualizing and achieving industrial system transition for a dematerialized and decarbonized world	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS			English	Article						Decarbonization; Dematerialization; Circular economy; Environmental governance; Environmental strategy; Sustainable production	CLIMATE-CHANGE; ENERGY; ADAPTATION; SUSTAINABILITY; CONSTRUCTION; CONSUMPTION; TECHNOLOGY; EFFICIENCY; DEMAND	The concept of industrial system transition introduced in the IPCC special report on Global Warming of 1.5 degrees C remains poorly conceptualized. In this paper, we deepen the conceptualization of the industrial system transition to decarbonization, dematerialization, and sustainable industrial production. Aided by fuzzy cognitive maps that use perception-based data from stakeholders to model complex and difficult-to-model systems, we chart the pathways for industrial system transition. The industrial system transition entails interactions between dematerialization and decarbonization goals while enabling governance and systemic corporate strategies. The respondents of the fuzzy cognitive maps-based surveys comprised practitioners from companies, authors, and the policymaking community. Fuzzy cognitive map-based simulations reveal that resorting to technical measures of dematerialization and decarbonization is insufficient to accomplish industrial system transition. The efficient industrial system transition to dematerialization and decarbonization requires the combined measures of (i) dematerialization and decarbonization, (ii) governance, policies, and regulations (effective governance including transnational governance, technology push, market-pull, technology transfer and financial flows, carbon price and carbon market; and (iii) enabling corporate strategies (regenerative and conscious capitalism, a new conception of transparency, and collaborative and constructive lobbying). Large companies are mostly transnational entities, necessitating the adoption of effective transnational governance strategies for achieving the objectives of dematerialization and decarbonization. Several transnational governance networks have partnered under the public-private co-governance mechanism in the decarbonization space dominated by mainly larger players. The advent of polycentric governance provides new opportunities for trans-local governance where large numbers of small and medium enterprises can participate in the advancement of at least decarbonization objectives; however, such networks require support from national governments. Besides implications for governance, policy and regulations, the findings of this research could also have implications for corporate behavior in terms of promoting conscious and transparent organizational culture.

Electrification versus hydrogen for UK road freight: Conclusions from a systems analysis of transport energy transitions	ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Energy systems; Energy infrastructure; Transport; Decarbonisation	DEMAND	Collectively the UK investment in transport decarbonisation is greater than 27B pound from government for incentivising zero-emission vehicles as part of an urgent response to decarbonise the transport sector. The investments made must facilitate a transition to a long-term solution. The success relies on coordinating and testing the evolution of both the energy and transport systems, this avoids the risk of unforeseen consequences in both systems and therefore de-risks investment Here, we present a semiquantitative energy and transport system analysis for UK road freight focusing on two primary investment areas for nation-wide decarbonisation, namely electrification and hydrogen propulsion. Our study assembles and assesses the potential roadblocks of these energy systems into a concise record and considers the infrastructure in relation to all other components within the energy system. It highlights that for system-wide success and resilience, a hydrogen system must overcome hydrogen production and distribution barriers, whereas an electric system needs to optimise storage solutions and charging facilities. Without cohesive, co-evolving energy networks, the planning and operational modelling of transport decarbonisation may fall short of meaningful real-world results. A developed understanding of the dependencies between the energy and transport systems is a necessary step in the development of meaningful operational transport models that could de-risk investment in both the energy and transport systems.

J	Hahn, A; Szarka, N; Thran, D				Hahn, Alena; Szarka, Nora; Thraen, Daniela			German Energy and Decarbonization Scenarios: "Blind Spots" With Respect to Biomass-Based Carbon Removal Options	FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH			English	Review						energy scenarios; Germany; negative emission technology (NET); Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR); Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS); biogenic carbon; carbon capture and utilization (CCU); power-to-gas (PtG)	GEOTHERMAL-ENERGY; MITIGATION; BIOENERGY	In 2019, the German government agreed on a Climate Protection Program intended to deliver its 2030 climate targets. Concrete measures, such as a carbon price, will be put in place as early as 2021. But how to plan beyond 2030? Scenarios can be powerful tools to envision the world in 20, 30, or 50 years, to describe pathways toward different visions of the future, and ultimately to investigate technology portfolios and policy options against their performance toward the achievement of a decarbonized future. This is why scenarios are especially popular with energy and climate scholars. In particular, scenarios with biomass-based carbon removal options (BCO2) can help to highlight how we may reach a net negative emission world. Hence, in this study, 66 energy and decarbonization scenario studies are systematically reviewed for Germany from the years 2002 to 2019 to assess how inclusive they are with regard to BCO(2)concepts. The portfolio of BCO(2)concepts within those scenarios is studied over time and a qualitative analysis of the scenario documentation is performed to identify the rationales for their inclusion or exclusion. The results indicate "blind spots" of the scenarios with regard to bioeconomy aspects, as biomass for material use is only sparsely covered. Likewise, only about 10% of the studies provide a framework for land use changes and corresponding emission accounting to adequately represent biomass-based negative emission technologies (NETs) in their assessments. The analysis for carbon capture and storage (CCS) further reveals the necessity of revisiting the public acceptance argument which has previously served so far for many studies as the ultimate, though not well-grounded deal-breaker. Based on the detected gaps and shortcomings in the current German scenario landscape, recommendations for a more transparent and holistic representation of BCO(2)in the scenario framework are given.

Balanced disruption in the race to net zero emissions	ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Decarbonisation; climate change; transitions; behaviour change; technology diffusion; disruption	CLIMATE; DYNAMICS; LONG	Delivering net zero emissions requires changing patterns of energy generation, consumption and land use. Mitigation efforts so far have mostly focused on reducing the emissions intensity of energy. Future decarbonisation must look outside the energy sector to disrupt markets, infrastructure, systems and behaviour. This study quantifies the disruption to technological markets and individual behaviours embodied in possible decarbonisation pathways for the United Kingdom. We review 12 strategies for decarbonisation proposed by a range of sources, including public and industry bodies, academic organisations and advocacy groups. The broad scope of perspectives yields a large set of possible mitigation options. A novel metric captures the embedded disruption across dual axes of technological and behavioural change. We find a distinct bias towards technological disruption through the pursuit of fast deployment and speculative technologies. Behavioural mitigation remains undervalued. The predominance of supply-side decarbonisation in global climate discourse means that a technological bias, illustrated here for the UK, is seen in mitigation strategies across the world. Historical evidence shows that technological diffusion takes decades, especially in energy markets, while behaviour change can be swifter. A technological bias reduces the likelihood of achieving net zero global emissions in time to limit global warming to 2 degrees C. To win the race against climate change, governments should rebalance policy efforts and spending across technological and behavioural options for mitigation.

J	Atkins, E				Atkins, Ed			'Bigger than Brexit': Exploring right-wing populism and net-zero policies in the United Kingdom	ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Right-wing populism; Net-zero; Decarbonisation; Cost-of-living; UK; Twitter		The emergence and consolidation of populist political movements have important consequences for renewable energy transitions - opposing infrastructure, denying climate science, or linking decarbonisation to broader antagonisms in society. The character of populist projects can change, absorbing new demands and grievances and linking them together within new narratives, policies, and forms of opposition. This commentary explores one emergent change in the United Kingdom - tracing how right-wing populist politicians and commentators have linked net-zero policies to a cost-of-living crisis, characterising decarbonisation as an undemocratic pursuit, and affirming the need to accelerate policies that enable the fracking of natural gas. The potential proliferation of these narratives poses a challenge, with net-zero policies being further pulled into broader political debates. However, such narratives also demonstrate important complexities of net-zero policies in the UK, which may enable decarbonisation to gain further popular appeal - through being linked to government 'levelling up' agendas and broader policies of 'green' job creation.

We investigate the radical behavioural and societal changes needed for the decarbonisation of the transport sector in Ireland. We perform a study through our system DECArbonisation in Road Transport (DECART), a suite of statistical and time series ML models for facilitating policy making, monitoring and advising governments, companies and organisations in the transport sector. Based on data analysis and through scenario-modelling approaches, we present alternatives to policy and decision makers to achieve goals in mitigation of carbon emissions in road transport. The models depict how changes in mobility patterns in road transport affect CO2 emissions. Through insights obtained from the models, we infer that renewable energy in Ireland has the potential for meeting the growing electricity needs of electric vehicles. Experimentation is conducted on real-world datasets such as traffic, motor registrations, and data from renewable sources such as wind farms, for building efficient ML models. The models are validated in terms of accuracy, based on their potential to capture hidden insights from real-world events and domain knowledge.

To meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement, the AFOLU sector greenhouse gases must be dramatically reduced and eventually transformed to net negative CO(2)e within this century. The decarbonisation choices will have significant environmental, social and economic impacts, yet few analytical frameworks exist able to account holistically for AFOLU mitigation strategies and their sustainable development impacts in a way that combines advantages of global and national approaches to decarbonisation pathways. This paper proposes a pathway design framework for AFOLU decarbonisation strategies that can help governments set targets across four types of levers (increasing sequestration; improving the emissions efficiency of agriculture; incentivising dietary changes; and displacing fossil fuels with bioenergy) and help them navigate potential synergies and trade-offs with sustainable development objectives (notably food security, biodiversity preservation, poverty alleviation and job creation), in a way that facilitates co-construction and discussion with main stakeholders.

Using examples of successful mitigation at the local level in China (Guangzhou) and India (Gujarat), this article identifies integrated governance solutions that work in both cases through different types of linkages. In China, it is mainly intra-governmental linkages, while in India it is mainly state-society linkages. In neither case do international negotiations concerning emissions targets have significant effects, while national frameworks have only marginal effects. Approaching the problem in this comparative manner helps to clarify how greenhouse gas governance operates in each country, the lessons for central-local environmental relations, and the implications for international assistance.

The IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report is a stark reminder of the importance of all countries, particularly those historically responsible for greenhouse gas emissions, devising and implementing the innovative and just policy solutions required to lower emissions. Within this context, this article explores the UK's sustainable energy policy making, and why it is not on course to meet targets, through the lens of government-business relations. It analyses government policy capacity, incumbent energy company influence, and how complex relations and dependencies have affected sustainable policy (non-)decisions and outcomes. It reveals that an over-reliance on incumbent energy companies in UK energy politics, although understandable given the need to provide affordable and secure energy, has contributed towards insufficient space for cheaper and more just clean energy solutions.

J	Watson, S; Bennett, G				Watson, Stephen; Bennett, George			Modelling Case Study of Compact Combination Hybrids as Low Disruption Decarbonised Heat	ENERGIES			English	Article						hybrid heat pump; decarbonisation; domestic heating		Transitioning from predominantly natural gas domestic heating to low carbon heating is one of the major challenges of the UK's net zero decarbonisation pathway. Compact wall-hung combination boilers are the dominant heating appliance and continue to be installed as a rate of over 1.5 million per year, compared to less than 50 k per year for Heat Pumps. The disparity persists despite repeated Government support in the form of the Renewable Heat Incentive and the Green Homes Grant. Compact hybrid appliances offer a technology solution similar to the current combination boiler in terms of size and performance, which could be attractive to consumers. However, there is currently little knowledge of the emissions savings that could be achieved in practice by compact hybrid appliances. This research systematically analyses real world high frequency boiler data to evaluate the potential of such appliances to make carbon savings while emulating combination boiler operation. By utilising high frequency diagnostic data from combination boilers, the disaggregated (hot water and heating) demand is mapped onto hybrid models to determine the energy and emission impact. Exploration of the relative power output of the HP and boiler components of the modelled hybrid appliances provides insight into the appropriate specification of compact hybrids which can deliver similar heat service to boilers while maximising emissions savings. The analysis shows that hybrid appliances with moderately sized HPs can significantly contribute to the decarbonisation of the homes considered in the study. Considerable disruption could be avoided in retrofit due to the physical size of the proposed heat pump and ability of the hybrid system to operate with the existing heat emitter network.

This paper uses a detailed model, and a carefully-constructed dataset, to show how a fuel tax reform affects differently Spanish metropolitan areas based on their fleet composition, share of public transport, and urban vs suburban distribution. We find that those areas with the largest share of diesel and with the highest penetration of public transport are able to reduce more their carbon emissions and energy use, at a lower welfare loss. We also fmd that the reductions obtained are not large, thus requiring additional measures.

Potassium prolinate has been chosen as a promising green solvent to be tested at two different concentrations (30% and 43.38% w/w ProK aqueous solutions). The applied methodology involves direct comparison of the alternative solvent against a reference case, such as 30% w/w MEA solution. The test has been carried out on a bench-scale facility composed of a glass column with internal random packing located at Sotacarbo Research Center (Sardinia); the facility has been run in open and closed cycle mode, assessing the performance in terms of CO2 removal from NGCC synthetic flue gases (e.g.: 4% mol/mol CO2 concentration). The outcome of this work provides new information based on experimental data on removal, maximum achievable loading, loading increment rate and solvent capacity, and it constitutes a novel contribution to the literature. Moreover, it represents a tangible effort in delivering an insight on non-precipitating amino acid viability for flue gas decarbonization in CCS technologies.

Meeting these commitments will require new industry management architectures that align measures of progress (economic, environmental, human and social) with government structures, datasets, and reporting. Comprehensive emissions quantification and reduction targets for tourism must be a part of this new architecture. In this paper we propose a comprehensive Tourism Carbon Information System (TCIS), comprising four essential information components: national tourism carbon footprint, the carbon economic linkage, drivers and decarbonization progress, and benchmarking. The TCIS is then tested and applied to Aotearoa New Zealand (2007-2013) to track tourism carbon performance and its decarbonization speed, compared to the national average across sectors. This critical information sheds light on future growth in tourism relative to the national greenhouse gas inventory and establishes the required mitigation trajectory for destinations to move onto a sustainable emissions pathway.

In this context, the technologies for hydrogen production offer a clean and versatile alternative to boost renewables penetration and energy security. Hydrogen production as a strategy for the decarbonization of the energy sources mix has been investigated since the beginning of the 1990s. The stationary sector, i.e. all parts of the economy excluding the transportation sector, accounts for almost three-quarters of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions (mass of CO2-eq) in the world associated with power generation. While several publications focus on the hybridization of renewables with traditional energy storage systems or in different pathways of hydrogen use (mainly power-to-gas), this study provides an insightful analysis of the state of art and evolution of renewable hydrogen-based systems (RHS) to power the stationary sector. The analysis started with a thorough review of RHS deployments for power-to-power stationary applications, such as in power generation, industry, residence, commercial building, and critical infrastructure. Then, a detailed evaluation of relevant techno-economic parameters such as levelized cost of energy (LCOE), hydrogen roundtrip efficiency (HRE), loss of power supply probability (LPSP), self-sufficiency ratio (SSR), or renewable fraction (fRES) is provided. Subsequently, lab-scale plants and pilot projects together with current market trends and commercial uptake of RHS and fuel cell systems are examined. Finally, the future techno-economic barriers and challenges for short and medium-term deployment of RHS are identified and discussed.	[Maestre, V.

Technologies for the production of electrical and thermal energy with reduced generation of carbon dioxide, which are being implemented in a short time, are discussed. A possible method for quantifying the level of CO2 emissions for the conditions of Kazakhstan is shown, through the use of the specific consumption of conventional (carbon) fuels for production as a unit of thermal energy and / or electricity. A number of available and relatively cheap technological solutions are presented, which, when implemented, can significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions. It is noted that these technologies can be implemented administratively and economically, and the formulations of the required decisions of the Government are given. For each of the proposed technologies, an assessment of possible volumes of reduction of carbon dioxide emissions is given and difficulties that may be encountered during implementation are indicated. A scheme for determining the degree of participation of a particular country in global carbonation is considered and it is shown that, depending on the method of "spreading" the total volume of emissions of a particular country, one and the same country can be both among prosperous countries and among a number of countries to which it is necessary to apply strict "carbon" taxes. It is noted that the determination of the share of a particular country in the form of emissions per unit area of the country's territory seems to be more "fair" taking into account the global nature of pollution.

At the same time, a large percentage of this energy use is attributed to space heating, cooling and ventilation, and is hence correlated to the climate. While the energy performance of Australian hospitals at the design stage is evaluated using historical weather data, the impact of the warming climate on Australian hospitals into the future remains unknown. The research question addressed is: What is the impact of future climates on the energy use of Australian hospitals built with the current design conditions? Two archetype hospital models were developed (a small single-story healthcare facility and a large multi-story hospital). DesignBuilder was used to simulate the performance of these models in 10 locations, ranging from the tropics to cool temperate regions in Australia. Current (1990-2015) and future climate files (2030, 2050, 2070 and 2090) were used. The results show that with the warming climate, the heating demand decreased, while the cooling demand increased for both hospital models for all sites. Cooling dominated climates, such as Darwin and Brisbane, were significantly impacted by the changing climates due to a substantial increase in cooling energy use. Heating based climates, such as Hobart and Canberra, resulted in an overall small reduction in total building energy use. In addition, the single-story facility was more impacted by the change in climate (in terms of energy use intensity) than the multi-story facility. The study highlights the importance of future climate files in building simulation and decarbonization planning.

J	Sam, AG; Song, DB				Sam, Abdoul G.; Song, Danbee			ISO 14001 certification and industrial decarbonization: An empirical study	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						ISO 14001; Carbon emissions; Voluntary pollution reduction; Manufacturing; Korea	ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; REDUCTION; GREEN; LAW	Voluntary environmental programs have proven to be a viable tool of pollution abatement, supplementing the command-and-control approach and market-based policies such as emissions trading and taxes. These voluntary initiatives aim to achieve pollution reduction through several channels, including procedural changes, raw material changes, product and packaging redesign, and innovation in pollution control technologies. The ISO 14001 standard is such a voluntary program; first introduced in 1996 by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), it has steadily grown since and has been widely adopted by organizations around the world. In this paper, we empirically study the effects of the ISO 14001 standard on carbon emissions using a panel dataset of Korean manufacturing firms. As the largest contributor to the warming of the earth's atmosphere, carbon emissions are the focus of national and international efforts to curb climate change. The Korean manufacturing industry is responsible for about 40% of greenhouse gases in the country and has experienced rapid growth in ISO 14001 certified facilities. Our econometric results indicate that ISO 14001 certification spurs a significant reduction in carbon emissions among certified firms, after accounting for its potential endogeneity with an instrumental variable strategy. The empirical results suggest that wider ISO 14001 certification among carbon-intensive industries can be a credible pathway to help achieve the Korean government's goal of cutting domestic carbon emissions by 37% by 2030.

Global energy growth is outpacing decarbonization	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Editorial Material							CO2 EMISSIONS; POVERTY	Recent reports have highlighted the challenge of keeping global average temperatures below 2 degrees C and - even more so-1.5 degrees C(IPCC 2018). Fossil-fuel burning and cement production release similar to 90% of all CO2 emissions from human activities. After a three-year hiatus with stable global emissions (Jackson et al 2016; Le Quere Cet al 2018a; IEA 2018), CO2 emissions grew by 1.6% in 2017 to 36.2 Gt (billion tonnes), and are expected to grow a further 2.7% in 2018 (range: 1.8%-3.7%) to a record 37.1 +/- 2 Gt CO2 (Le Quere et al 2018b). Additional increases in 2019 remain uncertain but appear likely because of persistent growth in oil and natural gas use and strong growth projected for the global economy. Coal use has slowed markedly in the last few years, potentially peaking, but its future trajectory remains uncertain. Despite positive progress in similar to 19 countries whose economies have grown over the last decade and their emissions have declined, growth in energy use from fossil-fuel sources is still outpacing the rise of low-carbon sources and activities. Arobust global economy, insufficient emission reductions in developed countries, and a need for increased energy use in developing countries where per capita emissions remain far below those of wealthier nations will continue to put upward pressure on CO2 emissions. Peak emissions will occur only when total fossil CO2 emissions finally start to decline despite growth in global energy consumption, with fossil energy production replaced by rapidly growing low-or no-carbon technologies.

The majority of previous studies adopted a one-directional approach to examine the factors affecting energy transitions and did not quantitatively estimate the driving effects of different factors on low-carbon energy transition from the two perspectives of energy mix and energy efficiency. This study aimed to explore which mechanisms can effectively drive the low-carbon energy transition under the current setting and what cross-cutting insights might be gained from energy transition dynamics observed in a large and emerging economy such as China. After employing Baron and Kenny's three-step procedure to identify the mediating effects, we found that policy factors constitute the main forces behind the transition of the energy structure toward natural gas, and that technical knowledge stock mediates the impact of both energy-saving goals and new energy subsidy policies on energy intensity. Furthermore, under the pressure of energy-saving target assessment, local governments have adopted a "campaign-style " energy-saving approach. Moreover, state-owned capital may assume greater importance in the advancement of energy transition relative to other ownership types. Finally, this study put forward several policy implications, including the need to promote long-term mechanisms, low-carbon technologies, and renewable energy.

At the beginning of the 21st century, three revolutions (D3) of 1-) decarbonization, 2-) decentralization, and 3-) digitalization took place, shaped our century, and as a result of digital sustainable education developments, governments also changed. On the other hand, in the technological age, based on the 5th wave theory, the issue of educational sustainability based on the 7PS model became increasingly the concern of academic societies. Since the beginning of the 20 century, the calls of different parts of society, from international institutions to academia, questioned the validity of the current definition of innovative digital educational sustainability. In fact, they state that economic growth, social inclusion and environmental balance, no longer reflect all the dimensions of our global educational societies and propose the addition of other dimensions to policies aiming at digital education, and, based on the 7PS model the political sustainability. The fundamental purpose of sustainable governance is to work in the direction of a healthy, safe, patient and creative society, based on the Hybrid business concept and not just a financially prosperous also environmentally, socially and more focus of education. That means governments must promote a development model which "meets current needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs and with a readiness of the future concerns" And in the midst, cyber-government, as a catalyst for the dimensions of a good governance, has enabled government to facilitate the promotion of sustainability in all its pillars (based on the 9PGS model) through integrated policies and sustainable laws, transparency, accountability, commitment and efficiency in providing public services. So, governments have to protect the resources for future generations, but in an age where IoT-Business has penetrated most aspects of society, the world no longer faces only economic, social and environmental challenges, also sustainable education and training. Now that we are on the verge of tomorrow, it is essential that the government recognizes and manages the today's challenges and based on the 3D Socio Eco Environment SME model to 1-) forecast, 2-) prevent, and 3-) face tomorrow's crises for a sustainable future and to make the world a better place for thing with the participation of citizens in a new concept called Utopia/Urban 6.0. In this research, we are going to study how Cyber Government can be infrastructure for the Sustainable Governance with examining solutions to tomorrow's crises through the 5th wave theory, Edu 5.0 concept and 9PSG model. In addition, this article is very innovative due to the use of the author's theories, concepts and models.

I focus on four processes reshaping Australia's electricity governance in the last two decades, namely deregulation, (de)centralisation, decarbonisation, and digitalisation, and show the ubiquity of state spatial strategies to govern through markets. I establish the historical legacy of subnational state-led development in Australian electricity, then examine how recent deregulatory processes have resulted in new modes of state power exercised through the creation and taming of markets. My claims are that subnational governments continue to exercise authoritative power under Australian federalism and that new networks of techno-managerial market governance remain subject to hierarchical state power. The purchase of key electricity assets has become a strategy for exercising state influence in and through the market. Political and spatial economic geographies of Australian energy continue to shape the struggles over energy futures, requiring attention to place, scale, territory, and network. The socio-spatial dimensions of state strategies reveal complex and vacillating modes of state power. State action is characterised by a lack of coordination rather than unification at different scales, and the capacity to execute state projects is complicated by discursive and agential politics.

J	Ludig, S; Schmid, E; Haller, M; Bauer, N				Ludig, Sylvie; Schmid, Eva; Haller, Markus; Bauer, Nico			Assessment of transformation strategies for the German power sector under the uncertainty of demand development and technology availability	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS			English	Review						Decarbonization; CCS; Renewable energy; Demand uncertainty	ELECTRICITY-GENERATION; RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY; ENERGY; MODEL; CHALLENGES; SYSTEM; COST	The long-term energy strategy issued by the German government in 2010 and 2011 embraces a substantial reduction of CO2 emissions and high shares of renewable energy in electricity production, along with energy efficiency improvements and an accelerated nuclear phase-out. While several studies illustrate scenarios reaching these targets, there are substantial uncertainties pertaining to key assumptions, particularly long-term electricity demand and the large-scale availability of offshore wind and carbon capture and storage (CCS). This paper explores conditions under which model-based scenarios for the German electricity sector comply with the official targets for CO2 emission reductions and renewable shares. We apply the energy system model LIMES-D, which allows for a joint optimization of generation and transmission capacities. The results indicate that reducing electricity demand plays a crucial role for attaining the government's targets. Scenarios for which either offshore wind or CCS is not available show an even stronger need for a decreasing electricity demand to reach the targets and a different pattern of transmission capacity expansion than is the case with full technology availability. Hence, a broad technology portfolio could in turn hedge against future power demand increases that may challenge the joint attainment of the German decarbonization and renewable energy targets.

J	Shaw, S; Van Heyst, B				Shaw, Stephanie; Van Heyst, Bill			Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) emissions as an indicator for sustainability	ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS			English	Article						Sustainability indicator; Nitrogen oxides; NOx; Decarbonization; Climate change	AIR-POLLUTION; ENVIRONMENTAL-QUALITY; HEALTH; SPACE	Environmental data and research illustrate that global warming, normally assessed through carbon dioxide (CO2) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, is a critical element in environmental sustainability and that a shift to decarbonized energy sources is necessary to preserve the environment for future generations. The challenge is that overall global sustainability is more complex than solely focusing on global warming or the environment. As a potential alternative, NOx emissions are explored as a potential surrogate for CO2 and GHG emissions and as an indicator for decarbonization. An added benefit of using NOx is that it has strong correlations with each pillar of sustainability, and therefore can offer a more encompassing view. Global and country specific NOx emissions, between 1990 and 2015, are analyzed in a format paralleling the three pillars. Trends show that, while NOx emissions are increasing, there are improvements in both societal and economic emission intensities. It is also demonstrated that there is no net movement towards decarbonization, and that a paradigm shift will be necessary to achieve the emissions reductions required. As well, human development index appears to be tied to the change in per capita emissions of NOx over the study period. Overall, NOx is demonstrated to be a robust and potentially more effective surrogate for CO2 and GHG emissions in estimating fossil fuel emissions and gauging movement towards decarbonization. The added interconnectedness of NOx with all three pillars makes it an excellent indicator for tracking progress towards overall sustainability.

It finds that climate policy and energy policy have largely been dissociated from one another. This failure of policy coordination and integration has been caused in part by attempts to reconcile clashing and competing neoliberal and weak ecological modernization discourses, and is reflected in the diverging goals and paths of each policy domain. The inability of Australian governments to define and articulate a coherent narrative around a low-carbon energy future has consequently constrained Australia's sustainable energy transition and led to contradictory and disjointed outcomes.

Using Australia as an exemplar of the many favourable policy outcomes which powerful corporate interests have secured from successive governments in relation to climate and energy policy, it seeks to demonstrate that covert networks of political influence have played a major role in the decisions made and actions implemented in both areas of policymaking over the last fifteen years. Through detailed empirical analysis of a database of current and former senior politicians, political staffers and bureaucrats with employment links to the fossil fuel and resource extraction industries, it argues that these industries have constructed a covert network of lobbyists and revolving door appointments which has ensured that industry interests continue to dominate Australia's energy policy, and that its emissions from fossil fuel use continue to rise. Covert corporate influence in Australia's energy and resource sectors provides an additional layer of explanation for the persistence of structural biases in its financing, policy and regulatory regimes to those accounts which draw on different forms of discourse and policy analysis.

All measures can be divided into financial (direct and indirect) and non-financial (related to the benefits of operating an electric car). Foreign experience shows that at the initial stages of market development, direct financial measures prove to be the most effective. Non-financial measures are the most impactful in combination with the direct support. Countries-car producers are cautious about the measures aimed at restrictions for traditional cars with internal combustion engines. In Russia the electric vehicles market is at the initial stage of development. The government started to provide incentives in a pilot mode, with the focus on indirect financial measures, and only for purchase of localized and domestic electric vehicles. A test survey conducted among potential buyers of electric cars in Russia has revealed that only about one-fifth of respondents is considering the purchase of electric vehicles and about a half of the respondents doubted the advisability of buying an electric car. There are a number of preconceptions about the effectiveness of the new technology. This perception hampers the demand. For potential buyers the introduction of direct subsidies would be the most important factor for making decision about purchasing an electric car. Quite a variety of indirect measures is also in demand because for potential buyers of electric vehicles the major drivers are the price of a car and the cost of electric vehicle performance. Non-financial measures are important only for about 15% of respondents. This is an indicator of low interest in decarbonization goals among population.

J	Bretschger, L				Bretschger, Lucas			Getting the Costs of Environmental Protection Right: Why Climate Policy Is Inexpensive in the End	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						Environmental Protection; Costs of Climate Policy; Decarbonization; IPAT Identity; IAT Formula	POPULATION-GROWTH; TECHNOLOGY; RESOURCES	The belief that stringent climate policies are very costly is widespread among political decision-makers and the public. The cost argument is often used by governments as a motivation for sluggish policy making. However, such judgements ignore the economic benefits of policy changes and implicitly build on a misguided decomposition of environmental impact into separate population, income, and technology effects. The paper shows that this method predicts policy-induced income losses that are systematically and significantly biased. I extend the decomposition analysis by introducing input substitution, which drastically lowers policy costs. By additionally incorporating a production approach, causal relationships between the drivers of resource use, and a framework for endogenous technology development I develop a new structural equation to assess climate policy effects. For a given decarbonization path, I calculate the projected income development at the global and country level. The use of the structural approach instead of agnostic decomposition suggests that the costs of a stringent climate policy are much lower than normally expected, which supports deep decarbonization.

From efficiency-driven to low-carbon operations management: Implications for labor productivity	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						climate change; decarbonization; efficiency wages; industry; labor productivity; low-carbon operations management; materials efficiency; stock turnover	LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; CORPORATE STRATEGIES; GIFT EXCHANGE; PANEL-DATA; PERFORMANCE; IMPACT; GREEN; INTENSITY; SYSTEMS	We use 9 years of dynamic panel data (4,090 observations) to explore how decarbonization moderates the association between a selection of efficiency-driven shop-floor initiatives and labor productivity. The results are mixed: the relationship between materials efficiency and labor productivity is positively moderated by decarbonization, but the relationship between increases in inventory turnover or the average firm wage as a multiple of average sector wages are negatively moderated by decarbonization. Overall, we find that decarbonization leads to an average drop in sales of 1.8% per worker. This evidence therefore suggests that climate change goals impacting industrial firms might be difficult to accomplish if managers expect to achieve decarbonization for free with current organizational best practices.

We employ an enhanced version of the MIT Economic Projection and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model to explicitly represent the following hard-to-abate sec-tors: iron and steel, non-ferrous metals (copper, aluminum, zinc, etc.), non-metallic minerals (cement, plaster, lime, etc.) , chemicals. We find that, without additional policies, the Paris Agreement pledges made by India for the year 2030 still can lead to an increasing use of fossil fuels and corresponding greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with projected CO2 emissions from hard-to-abate sectors growing by about 2.6 times from 2020 to 2050. Scenarios with electrification, natural gas support, or increased resource efficiency lead to a decrease in emissions from these sectors by 15-20% in 2050, but without carbon pricing (or disruptive technology changes) emissions are not reduced relative to their current levels due to growth in output. Carbon pricing that makes carbon capture and storage (CCS) economically competitive is critical for achieving substantial emission re-ductions in hard-to-abate sectors, enabling emission reductions of 80% by 2050 relative the scenario without additional policies. Without a substantial government support, decarbonization of India's hard-to-abate sectors will not be achievable.

The article sheds light on how the climate issue concerned the relationship between a Nordic state and its most important state-controlled enterprise, and exposes how Statoil responded to increasing calls for decarbonization while being privileged in climate policy-making processes. Furthermore, the article explores the origin and shortcomings of the puzzling argument about Norway's 'environment-friendly' oil and gas, and discusses how this argument helped enable Statoil and the rest of the industry to continue with business as usual despite growing social demands for the oil industry to step up its climate efforts.

J	Busby, JW; Shidore, S				Busby, Joshua W.; Shidore, Sarang			When decarbonization meets development: The sectoral feasibility of greenhouse gas mitigation in India	ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Climate change; Sectoral; India; Mitigation; Political feasibility	RENEWABLE ENERGY; SOCIAL-SCIENCE; POLITICS; POWER	In the run-up to the 2015 Paris climate talks, the Indian government announced ambitious climate mitigation goals as part of its INDC (Intended Nationally Determined Contributions). Whether India can meet these targets is a critical question with implications for the success of the Paris climate agreement. We assess India's potential for emissions mitigation through a sectoral lens, focusing on eight dominant sectors - namely electricity production, agriculture, road transport, buildings, and four disaggregated industry subsectors (steel, cement, petrochemicals, and fertilizers). We argue that whether emissions mitigation is favorable from a structural perspective is a function of two main factors: (1) political/organizational feasibility and (2) techno-economic feasibility. Political/organizational feasibility in turn is assessed through two additional factors, market concentration and government concentration. Our central intuition is that fragmented markets and/or fragmented government structures pose barriers for collective action. Road transport represents the most favorable sector for emissions mitigation followed by petrochemicals. Cement and fertilizers are already at or near the global efficiency frontier. Three sectors - electricity, agriculture, and steel - represent hard cases on both dimensions of feasibility. Buildings possess strong techno-economic feasibility but challenging political/organizational feasibility. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To this end, this study employs the state-of-the-art global integrated assessment model MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM to investigate mid-century decarbonization strategies for developing Asia to 2050. Our results indicate that a radical change in the energy portfolio is required to reach the target of 'well below' 2 degrees C. Specifically, our scenarios point to a rapid reduction of fossil fuel utilization, enhancement of low-carbon energy supply, and boosting of energy efficiency efforts. Such a transformation leads to a deep cut in CO2 emissions by 78% and 93% by 2050 in scenarios consistent with the 2 degrees C and 1.5 degrees C targets, respectively. Electricity generation and final energy consumption become dominated by low-carbon energy by 2050 in these scenarios. In terms of investment needs beyond a baseline scenario, the 2 degrees C and 1.5 degrees C pathways imply that the scale of low-carbon investment may need to double and triple, respectively. These increases would be partially offset by disinvestment in coal, oil and natural gas extraction and conversion infrastructure. Decarbonizing the energy system also impacts the capital needed for making progress on other sustainable development goals (SDGs), such as air pollution, clean water and food security. Key policy insights Governments will need to employ a variety of policy mechanisms, including mandates and subsidies for renewables and electric vehicles, efficiency standards for end-use technologies, and bans on free-emitting fossil fuel plants, among others. Relative to the baseline scenario for developing Asia, the scale of investment into low-carbon energy to 2050 may need to double for a 2 degrees C scenario, and to triple for 1.5 degrees C. Policy instruments such as green finance are essential for this region to mobilize a broadened channel of investment, particularly from the private sector. Low-carbon investment would significantly reduce the capital investment needed to achieve the SDG target for air quality, but increase the requirements for meeting targets on clean water and food security, though only to a small extent.

Consequently, the effectiveness of the simulation method was confirmed by comparison with experimental results from Hakata Port, Japan, and it was estimated that the percentage of energy saved by installing roof shades was 13-20% and the power consumption charges would decrease by approximately 4.82%. However, it was also revealed that introducing the roof shade system was challenging because of the high installation cost compared to the profit from energy conservation, thereby necessitating government support in social implementation. The results of this study are expected to provide powerful tools for decision makers in ports for preliminary evaluation of roof shade implementation, thereby contributing to the energy conservation and decarbonization of ports around the world.

TOWARD A SOCIALLY JUST TRANSITION TO LOW CARBON DEVELOPMENT: THE CASE OF INDONESIA	ASIAN AFFAIRS			English	Article						Indonesia; low carbon; decarbonisation; climate change; social justice; environment; growth; economy; environmental justice; forest; land use	ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE; REDD PLUS; DECARBONIZATION; MANAGEMENT; ECONOMY; IMPACT	In 2019, the Indonesian government released its post-Paris Agreement report Low Carbon Development: a paradigm shift towards a green economy in Indonesia, in which it set out an economic rationale for a move to low carbon growth. The core of the paradigm shift referenced in the report's title was that growth not only had to be decoupled from high carbon inputs but that in both practice and outcomes it had to be sustainable and inclusive. Yet the report does little to define social justice, equity practices, or inclusive outcomes in a green economy context. In this article, we foreground distributive, procedural and recognition aspects of social justice that are central to Indonesia's climate mitigation efforts and transition to a green, low carbon economy. We focus on two sectors that are key to this transition - forest and land-use, and energy. Our analysis shows that existing forms of injustice can exacerbate challenges for decarbonisation action and that low carbon transitions initiatives have been unable to overcome various forms of injustice and have, in some cases, created new injustices.

A case study of solar policy retreat in Shenzhen, China	ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Urban experimentation; Transition governance; Social resistance; Building-integrated solar thermal (BIST) technology; China	URBAN ENERGY TRANSITIONS; SUSTAINABILITY TRANSITIONS; INNOVATION SYSTEMS; GOVERNANCE; POLITICS; INFRASTRUCTURES; PARTICIPATION; CITIES; SPACES; SCALE	Low-carbon energy transitions envision deep decarbonization of the consumption, distribution, and production of the energy system. Urban areas are the frontier for low-carbon transitions. Despite increasing attention on the role of urban politics in urban energy transitions, transition governance in China still follows a rather functionalist and instrumentalist logic that highlights the government's leadership in resource mobilization. Disproportionate report of successful cases has reinforced this governing logic, while shadowed the political dynamics of transition processes, particularly the role played by local communities. Through a failed case of solar experimentation in Shenzhen, China, this article shows that the success of low-carbon experiments is not necessarily guaranteed by the strong governance capacities of local governments. Strong social resistance can produce a countering effect on the outcome of low-carbon experiments. The study calls for future research to adopt a more dynamic and holistic perspective of urban energy transitions and to take account of the mediating or even countering effects of urban politics.

Decarbonization of the Colombian Building Sector: Social Network Analysis of Enabling Stakeholders	BUILDINGS			English	Article						climate change; GHG mitigation; public policy; enabler networks; net-zero roadmap; developing countries; social network analysis	CO2 EMISSIONS; IMPACT	Reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is one of the main challenges to stopping climate change; in particular, the building sector acts as one of the main emitters. In response, governments have been developing nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and roadmaps to establish measures to achieve net-zero emissions. One of the main barriers to implementing these measures, particularly in the building sector, underlays in stakeholder integration. Through social network analysis (SNA) concepts, this research explores the roles of the actors whose participation is required in decarbonizing the Colombian building sector. These stakeholders engage in enabling categories (e.g., policy, finance, technology, and capacity development) required to achieve net-zero emissions, according to the goals proposed by the Colombian Green Building Council (CGBC). For the network analysis, we employ the results of semi-structured interviews led by the CGBC within the framework of the Zero Carbon Building Accelerator (ZCBA) project. Findings show highly interconnected networks characterized by redundant connections among actors. Three types of actors are identified within each enabler network: prominent actors with high centrality values, in charge of coordinating most of the actions required to achieve net-zero emissions; second-level actors limited to specific roles in policy-making processes; and perimeter actors focused on a few particular actions.

A fuzzy multiple attribute decision making tool for HVAC&R systems selection with considering the future probabilistic climate changes and electricity decarbonisation plans in the UK	ENERGY AND BUILDINGS			English	Article						Multiple attribute decision making; Fuzzy decision making; Climate change; Global warming; Building energy; HVAC&R systems selection	MODEL; SET; AID	Buildings account for 40% of total energy consumption in the UK and more than 55% of this energy is used by heating, ventilation, air-conditioning and refrigeration (HVAC&R) systems. This significant energy demand and the ascending trend in utilising HVAC&R systems together with the global need to impose energy-efficiency measures underline the importance of selecting the most appropriate HVAC&R system during the design process. This paper reviewed and classified a broad range of principal multiple attribute decision making methods. Among them, the fuzzy multiple attribute decision making approach was adopted to develop a decision making tool for HVAC&R systems selection. This was mainly due to the ability of this method to deal with the uncertainties and imprecisions of the linguistic terms involved in the decision making process. In order to make a decision on HVAC&R systems selection, 58 alternative systems, including both primary and secondary parts, were examined. The scope of this study enabled the consideration of all 18 climate regions in the UK and included the effects of climate change. In addition, the Government's electricity decarbonisation plans were integrated within the developed decision making model for HVAC&R systems selection in office buildings in the UK. Finally, the model was transferred into a computational tool with a user-friendly interface. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this context, it is crucial that communities dependent on fossil fuel extraction and production for employment do not become 'victims' of the decarbonisation process. This paper involves a theoretically and conceptually grounded comparative analysis of policy measures that have been introduced in three first world jurisdictions which have been dependent on coal for employment North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany, Alberta in Canada and Victoria in Australia. In so doing, measures which have successfully ameliorated the socio-economic well-being of coal dependent communities are identified and a framework for successful just transition is proposed. Recognising, but notwithstanding, inherent power dynamics, the framework identifies an important role for government in assisting workers and communities in navigating the transition process and in supporting new and emerging low-carbon industries in the context of 'strong' sustainable development.

Contrariwise, freight transport has not received equal consideration in policy measures, regulatory frameworks, and support schemes towards the low-carbon transition. This study seeks to address this imbalance. Methods: The paper proposes an adaptation of the ASI framework for freight transport and assesses the applicability of a number of international sustainable transport measures based on their potential sustainability impact if adopted in Ireland. The research applied a Policy Delphi Method to a heterogeneous expert panel. Results: The findings indicate that the current sustainable freight transport policy measures in Ireland are limited, and the paper suggests 38 measures for supply chains, maritime transport, rail transport and urban freight transport. The analysis further suggests that decarbonisation measures in Ireland should first formulate on the decarbonisation stages 'avoid' and 'shift', and then move to the 'improve' stage, thus leading to a greater impact on decarbonising the freight sector. Conclusions: An 'ASI for freight transport' framework is proposed as a taxonomy to systematically compare freight decarbonisation policy measures locally and internationally. This updated framework can serve as a new lens to prioritise sustainable freight policy measures. Recommendations are proposed for developing policy measures for sustainable freight transport in Ireland.

Despite such ambitions, realized emissions reductions continue to fall alarmingly short of modeled energy transition pathways for achieving net-zero. This gap is largely a result of the difficulty of realistically modeling all the techno-economic and sociopolitical capabilities that are required to deliver actual emissions reductions. This limitation of models suggests the need for an energy-systems analytical framework that goes well beyond energy-system modeling in order to close the gap between ambition and reality. Toward that end, we propose the Emissions-Sustainability- Governance-Operation (ESGO) framework for structured assessment and transparent communication of national capabilities and realization. We illustrate the critical role of energy modeling in ESGO using recent net-zero modeling studies for the world's two largest emitters, China and the United States. This illustration leads to recommendations for improvements to energy-system modeling to enable more productive ESGO implementation.

J	Little, DI; Sheppard, SRJ; Hulme, D				Little, David I.; Sheppard, Stephen R. J.; Hulme, David			A perspective on oil spills: What we should have learned about global warming	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Climate change; Contingency plans; Decarbonisation; Multilateralism; Social justice		Scientific knowledge of marine pollution and oil spill response (OSR) innovation has diffused over half a century. Local community resilience to spills and the equitable application of knowledge worldwide are constrained by several barriers. These range from access, governance, cost minimisation, through austerity and poverty in affected areas, to realpolitik (e.g. vested interests, nationalism, corruption, security breakdown and war). Ongoing incidents show inequalities in spill risk and OSR capability. Advances in knowledge have belatedly brought us to the conclusion that the logical way to reduce adverse impacts of oil in an era of global warming is to accelerate decarbonisation. This would rapidly and simultaneously reduce the frequency, magnitude and consequences of oil spills. Meanwhile, mitigating spills, managing OSR, and restoring local communities and ecosystems at spill sites are fundamental obligations for the oil industry. These obligations should be routinely enforced by all responsible governments, and backed by inter-governmental agencies and conventions. However, we must no longer assume that even the best practices in exploration, production, refining, transport and consumption of hydrocarbons can adequately reduce their leading role in the ongoing destruction of the global environment.

This integration maximises the synergy across different energy sectors to improve the value and utilisation of investment, especially in low-carbon technologies across all sectors. This study presents an integrated multi-energy optimisation model to evaluate the economic performance and system implications of different road-transport decarbonisation strategies and analyse the synergy with the power sector decarbonisation. The large-scale optimisation model is formulated to consider the interactions across electricity, hydrogen, and transport sectors and used to determine the optimal solutions for investment and sector-coupling operation in the system. The proposed model is tested using a range of transport decarbonisation scenarios considering the deployment of electric or hydrogen vehicles or their combination and the integration with the power system. The studies analyse the economic performance and optimal energy system portfolios across different scenarios. The results demonstrate the importance of road-transport and power-to-gas integration in Great Britain's future energy system.

As such, the concept of a single/obvious "business as usual" or "reference" scenario is no longer relevant. Instead, there are multiple plausible futures that should be explored. We contribute one such scenario that carefully considers emission-reduction trends and actions that are likely in the future, absent globally coordinated mitigation effort. We explore the long-term implications for energy, emissions, and temperature outcomes if the world continues to address climate change in the way it has so far-through piecemeal actions and growing social and technological pressures. This Growing Pressures scenario results in a central scenario outcome of about 3 degrees C of surface temperature warming, which is higher than the "well below 2 degrees C" level aspired by the Paris Agreement, but lower than many widely used "no-policy" scenarios. Ongoing and growing pressures of change, the roots of which are clearly visible today, could deliver a plausible energy transition scenario to near zero emissions that plays out over the coming century. While a more aggressive transition is clearly required, this finding highlights the need to bring actions forward in time to achieve an improved outcome making use of clearly identifiable policies and technologies.

ENERGIES			English	Article						electrified bus; public transportation; consumer preference; best-worst scaling; decarbonization	WIDESPREAD ADOPTION; PUBLIC PERCEPTION; HYBRID BUSES; FUEL-CELL; VEHICLES; ATTITUDES; HYDROGEN; SATISFACTION; PREFERENCES; BARRIERS	The Korean government has announced plans to supply electrified buses to achieve decarbonization in the transportation sector and to create next-generation growth engines. Although a multitude of technical and political studies have been conducted to support the successful introduction of electrified buses, studies on the attitudes and perceptions of passengers toward electrified buses remain insufficient. To evaluate the perceptions and preferences of potential passengers toward the specific attributes of electrified buses, this study performed an online survey (N = 586) that includes people who had experienced travel on public buses. Values of the relative importance of eight different attributes-safety, ride comfort, environmental friendliness, exterior design, cleanliness, crowding, seat comfort, and convenience getting on/off-were evaluated using the best-worst scaling method. The results showed that safety (share of preference: 41.3%) was the most important attribute when using electrified buses. This was followed by eco-friendliness (14.3%) and ride comfort (13.6%). On the other hand, the least important attribute was exterior design (1.8%). Gender differences were also observed in the valuation of certain attributes among the passenger preferences toward electrified buses. The results of this study contribute to the development of strategies for the wide-spread adoption of electrified buses and provide a stepping-stone to a more sustainable public transportation system.

Crop straw, especially wheat, rice, and maize straw, is one of the significant feedstocks for bioenergy production. However, the production potential of different types of bioenergy from crop straw, and its potential to reduce CO2 emissions are poorly understood. Thus, we collected crop straw utilization data at the provincial level via face-to-face field surveys to estimate straw quantity until 2030, dividing the 31 provincial regions in mainland China into four regions each for wheat (W-I, II, III, IV), rice (R-I, II, III, IV), and maize (M-I, II, III, IV), respectively, based on their quantity and distribution. The results show that if all three types of straw are used for bioenergy production, the bioenergy production potential is 75.1 Mtce for electricity, 151.5 Mtce for bioethanol, 182.1 Mtce for biomethane, and 329.1 Mtce for briquette fuel in 2030. Substituting electricity, bioethanol, biomethane, and briquette fuel for fossil fuels could reduce CO2 emissions by 562.9, 362.4, 220.4, and 1654.2 Mt, respectively. Our study indicates that wheat straw should be used for bioethanol and electricity production, maize straw for electricity and briquette fuel, and rice straw for biomethane. This research provides a good reference for local and national governments for policy formulation regarding straw utilization, and it will also help bioenergy plants select the best plant locations, bioenergy types, and feedstock types to obtain a high quantity of bioenergy and realize decarbonization development.

An optimisation model was developed for investigating the operation of future low carbon electricity, gas and heat supply systems. The model was employed to quantify the impacts on the operation of the gas network in Great Britain of transitioning to low carbon power and heat. The modelling results show that the decarbonisation of the power and heat sectors affects the operation of the high and low pressure gas networks differently. A highly electrified heat sector, only slightly changes the gas load duration curve for the high pressure gas transmission network, but significantly affects the load duration curve for low pressure gas distribution networks. In addition, in a future energy system with a large capacity of variable wind and solar generation, and highly electrified heat supply, although the annual volume of gas supply decreases, the peak gas supply during low wind and cold spells remains the same or even exceeds the current figure. This is mainly due to gas-fired power plants operating to their maximum capacity to complement the wind resource and also supply electricity for heat pumps. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Policy preferences collected from relevant government representatives of the region are analyzed using choice architecture and fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process. The experts' preferences concerning criteria related to land use, decarbonization and development of a national market are ranked with similar importance, with a slight preference for the latter. The results demonstrate a great variation in the priorities for forming and implementing biofuel policies in the region, strongly related to national realities (e.g. available land for biofuel production, target fulfilment). Countries delaying in their biofuel targets aim at policies that fulfil internal demands without considering other criteria related to land use issues and own sources. The results show a general agreement (95% consensus) of having about 66% of renewable energy in transport covered from biofuels resulting from domestic biomass supply. Yet, there are differing preferences in the policy options at country level, which makes a single consensus policy for the macro-region challenging. Finally, the results highlight the different degrees of policy intervention that are implicit in the policy preferences of the national decision makers.

They have been promoted as technologies with tremendous potential for boosting economic growth and sustainability in all sectors of society - a claim whose validity remains underexplored. Building on systems thinking and the Multi-Level Perspective, we develop a novel approach to assess the socio-technical impact of a KET regime on a transitioning sectoral regime. This approach is applied to the case of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) KET impacting the decarbonization of the energy-intensive steel industry. To assess AI's technical impact, we compiled an inventory of AI tools based on reviewing technical scientific articles. Our analysis shows that AI adds technological value to the full range of areas in the steel industry, like predicting process parameters; optimizing operations, scheduling, and electrical energy; and forecasting product demand, quality, and site emissions. Semi -structured interviews were the primary data source to assess AI's broader socio-institutional impact. The results indicate that AI may currently be reinforcing path dependencies of the steel industry, as AI tools are more focused on incremental improvement for existing technologies rather than novel low-carbon technologies. However, AI also offers capabilities to reduce barriers to sustainability innovation, like system integration challenges, flexi-bility challenges, demand-side barriers, and risk-related barriers. Finally, we reflect on the generalizability of our approach for studying other transitions, and we induce characteristics of the AI-Digital KET regimes. We find that through these characteristics, the AI-Digital KET regime alters existing and creates new system structures (actors, networks, and institutions) within the impacted sector.

J	Paterson, M				Paterson, Matthew			SS-03 'The End of the Fossil Fuel Age'? Discourse Politics and Climate Change Political Economy	NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY			English	Article						Climate change; discourse politics; fossil fuels; decarbonisation	CARBON; FUTURE	This paper explores the implications of the reframing of climate change as a question of the 'end of the fossil fuel age'. This was a common interpretation of the logic of the Paris Agreement in the UNFCCC in December 2015, the implications of the IPCC's fifth assessment report, and in the framing of climate change by the fossil fuel divestment movement. The paper argues that this signifies an important shift in the framing of climate change, away from ones such as 'emissions reduction' or 'decarbonisation', towards more transformational understandings of climate change. It aims to contribute to attempts to repoliticise climate change by focusing on how this frame helps us re-emphasise the political conflicts inherent to climate change politics, ignored by more technocratic visions of 'economic efficiency' or 'transition management'. But at the same time, it seeks to problematise some attempts to recast climate change as political, by emphasising the tension between articulating climate change as a struggle between heroic social movements representing humanity and fossil fuel corporations and their allies in government, and the complexity of the socio-technical systems within which fossil fuels are embedded, which thus complicate the simplifying effects of the 'end of fossil fuels' frame.

Replacing fossil fuels with low-carbon electricity is at the core of this challenge; however, the aggregate electrification potential and resulting system-wide CO2 reductions for diverse industrial processes are unknown. Here, we present the results from a comprehensive bottom-up analysis of the energy use in 11 industrial sectors (accounting for 92% of Europe's industry CO2 emissions), and estimate the technological potential for industry electrification in three stages. Seventy-eight per cent of the energy demand is electrifiable with technologies that are already established, while 99% electrification can be achieved with the addition of technologies currently under development. Such a deep electrification reduces CO2 emissions already based on the carbon intensity of today's electricity (similar to 300 gCO(2) kWh(el)(-1)). With an increasing decarbonisation of the power sector IEA: 12 gCO(2) kWh(el)(-1) in 2050), electrification could cut CO2 emissions by 78%, and almost entirely abate the energy-related CO2 emissions, reducing the industry bottleneck to only residual process emissions. Despite its decarbonisation potential, the extent to which direct electrification will be deployed in industry remains uncertain and depends on the relative cost of electric technologies compared to other low-carbon options.

Accelerating a clean energy transition in Southeast Asia: Role of governments and public policy	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS			English	Article						Southeast Asia; Renewable energy; Business models; Financing instruments; Public policy; Regulations; Green finance; Energy efficiency	INDONESIA; EMISSIONS	Southeast Asia is a significant stakeholder in the global action against climate change, given its growing population, rising greenhouse gas emissions, and vulnerability to climate change impacts. Public policy makers in this region are faced with the challenge of transitioning to cleaner energy sources to enable the attainment of Paris Agreement goals, while also expanding access to affordable and reliable energy supplies. Southeast Asia has one of world's fastest growing rates of greenhouse gas emissions due to rising fossil fuel combustion, second only to South Asia. As such, it is imperative to decouple its energy consumption from emissions growth. This paper reviews Southeast Asia's energy sector trends, with a focus on electricity supply and demand vis-`a-vis global decarbonization efforts. Based on global and regional best practices, the paper highlights the crucial role that governments and public policy can play in accelerating the region's clean energy transition, namely through the establishment of mandatory long-term climate and renewable energy targets and binding policies; use of iterative and adaptive power system planning; support for effective market development; financing of pioneering investments and trunk infrastructure; and support for a just and equitable transition.

However, with their present state of development and costs, many of these decentralised technologies rely on public subsidies to be financially viable. It is questionable whether they are cost effective compared to other ways of reducing carbon emissions, such as decarbonisation of conventional supply and improving the energy efficiency of dwellings. Previous studies have found it difficult to reliably estimate the future potential of decentralised supply because this depends on the available residential space which varies greatly within a city region. To address this problem, we used an integrated modelling framework that converted the residential density forecasts of a regional model into a representation of the building dimensions and land of the future housing stock. This included a method of estimating the variability of the dwellings and residential land. We present the findings of a case study of the wider south east regions of England that forecasted the impacts of energy efficiency and decentralised supply scenarios to year 2031. Our novel and innovative method substantially improves the spatial estimates of energy consumption compared to building energy models that only use standard dwelling typologies. We tested the impact of an alternative spatial planning policy on the future potential of decentralised energy supply and showed how lower density development would be more suitable for ground source heat pumps. Our findings are important because this method would help to improve the evidence base for strategies on achieving carbon budgets by taking into account how future residential space constraints would affect the suitability and uptakes of these technologies.

This work presents a semi-empirical assessment of a two-stage cascade cycle for HTHP applications to produce hot water up to 150 degrees C from a water flow at 35 degrees C and 25 degrees C. This work uses experimental results of two single-stage heat pump prototypes (R-1234ze(E) and R-1336mzz(Z)) with different temperature lifts as baseline inputs. The energy performance of the proposed two stage cascade HTHP is evaluated through a semi-empirical model, including several novel mixtures for both stages. Up to 14% of COP increase was reached respect to the baseline when using R-152a/60 0 (0.08/0.92) and R-1233zd(E)/161 (0.88/0.12) for the low stage and high stage, respectively. The VHC increases 30% with the selected combinations, but the discharge temperature also rises. Direct CO2e emissions were negligible by using low GWP refrigerants. The country proposed for the two-stage cascade HTHP greatly influences greenhouse gas indirect CO2e emissions. It is estimated that in countries carbon emission factor lower than 0.35 kgCO2e kWh-1 the mixtures selected would reduce the emissions compared to fossil fuel boilers for the same heating capacity.(c) 2022 The Authors.

Under the dual pressures of decarbonisation, and the recognition of 'left behind' regions as potential hotspots for feelings of political marginalisation, new strategies for clean growth are emerging, aiming to boost local economic and environmental performance. Presenting data produced via biographical interviews and deliberative workshops in Port Talbot, South Wales, we explore how experiences of life in one of the UK's most significant manufacturing towns has shaped local feelings towards four place-based scenarios for industrial and energy systems decarbonisation. Drawing on the rich literatures detailing the cultural and emotional impacts of deindustrialisation, we illustrate how situated experiences of industrial dependence and decline shaped how Port Talbot residents made sense of visions for the town's future. In so doing we show how, in the face of industrial decline, alternative aspects of place emerged as locus points of emotional and cultural identification, 'public things' (Honig, 2017) in which alternative hopes for the future are invested. As emergent policies for clean growth become enacted in concrete projects, we argue for a clearer focus on experiences of and relationships embedded in industrial places, to ensure such strategies meet the desires of local communities.

J	Kattirtzi, M; Ketsopoulou, I; Watson, J				Kattirtzi, Michael; Ketsopoulou, Ioanna; Watson, Jim			Incumbents in transition? The role of the 'Big Six' energy companies in the UK	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Incumbents; Big Six; Power sector; Decarbonisation; Decentralisation; Digitalisation	GERMAN; UTILITIES; IMPACT	Amid rapid changes to energy systems around the world, there has been ongoing debate regarding incumbent actors' ability to respond to disruptive forces. This paper investigates the corporate strategies of the UK's large vertically integrated energy companies (the 'Big Six') between 2008 and 2016. Four of these companies are part of international groups, with parent companies in Germany, France and Spain. By analysing data from publicly available documents and a small number of key informant interviews with current and former decision-makers within Big Six companies and other stakeholders, this paper assesses their responses to three potentially disruptive changes to the UK's electricity sector: decarbonisation, decentralisation and digitalisation. Each of the Big Six have taken significant steps towards decarbonisation, with some progressing faster than others. Most have remained committed to centralised generation investments, and a couple have made early moves towards digital retail products and services but with limited impact thus far. The authors conclude that the UK's incumbent electricity firms have shown that they are able to adapt given strong policy incentives. Policy-makers should continue to set ambitious targets for the electricity sector, while taking into account the role of international parent companies in driving a broader strategy.

Carbon pricing approaches for climate decisions in US higher education: Proxy carbon prices for deep decarbonization	ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE			English	Article						Carbon management; Shadow price; Climate policy; Third sector; Non-state actor	GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; SOCIAL COST; LESSONS	Given the slow policy response by governments, climate leadership by other institutions has become an essential part of maintaining policy momentum, driving innovation, and fostering social dialogue. Despite growth in carbon pricing in government and the private sector, our review suggests low, but growing, adoption of internal carbon prices (ICPs) by higher education institutions (HEIs), who may be uniquely suited to implement and refine these tools. We analyze the range of ICP tools in use by eleven U.S. HEIs and discuss tradeoffs. Our analysis identifies several reasons why proxy carbon prices may be especially well-suited to decisions (especially at the system-scale) around carbon neutrality at a wide range of institutions. Using a unique dataset covering 10 years of real-world analysis with a proxy carbon price, we analyze the interaction of ICPs with life cycle cost analysis to start to identify when and how internal carbon pricing will be most likely to shift decisions. We discuss how schools and other institutions can collaborate and experiment with these tools to help drive good climate decision-making and inform climate policy at larger scales.

Scenarios and Price of the Transition to Low-Carbon Energy in Russia	THERMAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						decarbonization; economy; fuel and energy complex; low-carbon energy; fuel; noncarbon energy resources	STRATEGY	For half a century now, the concept of decarbonization has dominated the global political and economic agenda, and Russia, despite the incompleteness of its scientific justification and the obvious threats to the development of the country's economy and energy, has recently joined it. A basic (extrapolation of the most optimistic of the latest approved by the government) scenario for the development of the country's economy until 2050 is presented, and it is transformed into a scenario of accelerated energy decarbonization (intensive). For these scenarios, forecasts have been developed for the consumption of the main types of fuel and electricity, and the required volumes of production of all types of primary energy have been optimized, taking into account the transformation of world energy markets. The rates and volumes of phasing out oil and especially coal production, the role of gas in the transition to low-carbon energy, the achievable volumes and the structure of noncarbon energy production are shown. Calculations of the required volumes of investments in the fuel and energy complex (FEC) and the contribution of the value added of its industries to the country's gross domestic product (GDP) showed that, in the intensive scenario, the fuel and energy complex loses its leading role in the Russian economy from the 2030s. Dominance in it in terms of contribution to the economy is moving from the oil and gas complex to the power industry, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can be reduced to carbon neutrality by the mid-2050s (while maintaining the existing absorptive capacity of forests). The decarbonization of the energy sector will slow (relative to the baseline case) the growth of the Russian economy for 3 years in 2030-2050, and its cost to complete the energy transition will be even higher. The demolition of the geopolitical situation that occurred after the completion of the study and the preparation of the article will seriously change the scenarios for the development of the Russian economy and energy and, possibly, even the accepted paradigm of climate warming. But the methodology outlined here for the study and assessment of the degree of influence of the main factors of low-carbon policy on the energy and economy of the country will remain.	[Makarov, A.

The political and socio-technical roadblocks to decarbonising United Kingdom road freight	ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Road freight; Decarbonisation; Qualitative; Hydrogen; Socio-technical; Politics	STRATEGIC NICHE MANAGEMENT; SUSTAINABILITY TRANSITIONS; MULTILEVEL PERSPECTIVE; ENERGY TRANSITIONS; FUEL; INTERVENTIONS; GOVERNANCE; TRANSPORT; DYNAMICS; BIOFUELS	Road freight represents approximately 8.5% of UK carbon emissions and therefore must be abated if the UK government's objective to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 is to be achieved. While several technology options exist, it is commonly viewed as a hard-to-abate sector and progress to decarbonisation remains slow. Whereas techno-economic aspects of the low carbon transition of road freight are well studied, socio-technical and political aspects are much less so. This is in contrast with substantial socio-technical literature focused on the transition of passenger vehicles. Symptomatic of this, there is little direct engagement in research with freight industry operators and participants. This study seeks to address these gaps by considering the views of these key actors through qualitative social science research. Fifteen semi-structured interviews were undertaken with key stakeholders within the road freight industry. These revealed a range of themes and relevant issues which underline the complexity of this transition. Further analysis of the data revealed six overarching viewpoints that reflect the primary concerns of the expert interviewees. These viewpoints suggest that the challenges for the road freight transition are principally political and socio-technical, and opportunities are identified to further explore these through future research.

Our research focused on the aim of achieving social wellbeing and economic diversification within this energy-contested region. Using interviews (n = 42), we present several findings that can guide policy processes in the Upper Hunter, and inform processes in other communities. We find that local perspectives on the future of coal are more nuanced than the often binary public debate, indicating a common ground for local policy dialogue. The legacy of conflict between the two dominant sectors - coal mining and thoroughbred breeding - shapes perceptions about new industries for the region. There is an expectation that government will take a leading role in the region's efforts toward economic diversification, though this should be in partnership with industry and community. A plan that provides certainty and diverse, relevant opportunities for the region is desired. From these and other key findings we emphasise the importance of focusing on the social dimensions as a core part of the policy process, and suggest participatory and deliberative processes.

Exploring expert visions of energy system decarbonisation	FUTURES			English	Article						Demonstrator projects; Energy systems; Energy transition; Energy values; Future imaginaries; Sociotechnical imaginaries	SOCIOTECHNICAL IMAGINARIES; MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS; WIND ENERGY; TRANSITION; EXPECTATIONS; JUSTICE; NICHES; SPACE; POWER	Decarbonising the energy system means moving from a centralised, fossil fuel-dependent one to one based primarily on renewable energy. Visions of whole system change focus on sociotechnical concepts like electrification and flexibility, rather than single technologies such as nuclear or solar. The role that technological niches might play in relation to such systemic sociotechnical visions is under-researched. Traditionally, technological niches are thought to nurture new 'proto-regimes', supported by coherent visions of how technologies will help solve problems within existing socio-technical regimes. However, the relationship between socio-technical visions like flexibility and individual demonstrator projects is more complex. Interviews with experts from the FLEXIS energy systems project (south Wales, UK) show how future visions associated with a range of demonstrator projects are being developed against the backdrop of a system-level vision of a flexible, multi-vector energy system. Interview data also shows how the development of visions for demonstrators draws on social learning about place and societal values overlooked in systemic visions. Such social learning can incorporate critical reflection on key assumptions that underlie dominant system-level visions. The extent such learning is possible through the development of potential niches, however, is subject to limitations that invite further research.

Meanwhile, there are growing concerns over the increasing share of coal in the generation mix given its enormous emissions potential and energy security in the future. Electricity generation is responsible for the largest share of GHG emissions in Malaysia As the country pursue to become a high-income economy by 2020, increasing energy demand puts pressure on the government to choose cheaper energy sources when renewable energies become too costly. To date, progress in analysing the current situation and identifying effective emissions reduction strategies in the power sector has been very slow. Current government policy is channelled towards resource diversity and energy security without articulating sufficient emissions reduction targets and measures for the sector. The purpose of this study is to characterise the current issues related to CO2 emissions reduction strategies in the power sector, identify promising mitigation measures based on the experiences from other countries and the contemporary research outcomes, and note limitations and emergent policy issues. Achieving 45% CO2 emissions reduction target by 2030 along with high-income economic goal pose unique and enormous challenges for the Malaysia's economy. For these to be achieved, improving electricity generation efficiency in thermal power plants and implementing a group of emission abatement measures such as emissions trading scheme for efficient decarbonization of the power sector are inevitable.

Driven by a combination of technological advances as well as shifting societal demands, digitali-zation also affects the operation and planning of the electricity sector. This paper uses megatrend analysis framework to analyze digitalization phenomena, its regional differences, technologies, use cases and challenges. It highlights potential system-level benefits (e.g., increased efficiency, transparency, consumer participation) and challenges (e.g., electricity demand growth, autonomy loss, increasing cyber risks) currently reported in the literature. Eventually, building on the thorough analysis, we present a menu of policy options to exploit its full potential of digitalized electricity systems while mitigating adverse effects on decarbonization goals and consumers.

ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						Industrial decarbonisation; Computable general equilibrium; Carbon capture; Capital efficiency; Competitiveness; Subsidies; Socialising costs		Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a technically feasible deep decarbonisation solution. Still it is not widely adopted, arguably due to some basic political economy and policy challenges. One issue is the large infrastructure needs of transporting and storing CO2. However, a more fundamental challenge in the current UK industrial policy landscape is concern over introducing new costly capital requirements in industries that need to retain competitiveness in a world that has not yet fully signed up to the ?net-zero? transition demanded by the more ambitious 1.5 degrees Celsius warming target of the Paris Agreement. We take the example of high-value chemicals industries operating in the UK devolved region of Scotland and use an economy-wide computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to consider the nature and potential extent of export, GDP and employment losses under different illustrative polluter/government/taxpayer pays approaches to meeting the higher cost requirements. We conclude that the value from subsidising capture activity depends on the extent of export demand response to competitiveness losses resulting from firms bearing CO2 capture costs. However, outcomes reflect trade-offs across different types of sectors and employment, and are also dependent on labour market responses to changing wage and unemployment rates.

Deep decarbonization of cement manufacturing will require remediation of both the CO2 emissions due to the decomposition of CaCO3 to CaO and that due to combustion of fossil fuels (primarily coal) in calcining (similar to 900 degrees C) and sintering (similar to 1,450 degrees C). Here, we demonstrate an electrochemical process that uses neutral water electrolysis to produce a pH gradient in which CaCO3 is decarbonated at low pH and Ca(OH)(2) is precipitated at high pH, concurrently producing a high-purity O-2/CO2 gas mixture (1:2 molar ratio at stoichiometric operation) at the anode and H-2 at the cathode. We show that the solid Ca(OH)(2) product readily decomposes and reacts with SiO2 to form alite, the majority cementitious phase in Portland cement. Electrochemical calcination produces concentrated gas streams from which CO2 may be readily separated and sequestered, H-2 and/or O-2 may be used to generate electric power via fuel cells or combustors, O-2 may be used as a component of oxyfuel in the cement kiln to improve efficiency and lower CO2 emissions, or the output gases may be used for other value-added processes such as liquid fuel production. Analysis shows that if the hydrogen produced by the reactor were combusted to heat the high-temperature kiln, the electrochemical cement process could be powered solely by renewable electricity.

J	Kumar, P; Mishra, T; Banerjee, R				Kumar, Pankaj; Mishra, Trupti; Banerjee, Rangan			Impact of India's power purchase agreements on electricity sector decarbonization	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Indian power sector; Emission mitigation; Climate change mitigation	FUTURE	A large number of Indian thermal power plants are tied under power purchase agreements with distribution companies. However, the existing energy models do not account for these 'take or pay' contracts for investigating climate policies. In this context, this paper investigates the impact of these power purchase agreements on power sector operations, cost of electricity and emissions from the Indian power sector. An optimization model was developed for this study with 620 coal, 239 gas, 21 nuclear and 686 hydro units with technology and operational characteristics to analyze electricity dispatch for power sector. The operations of thermal power plants were analyzed with and without power purchase agreements, and low carbon policy scenario. The scenarios are compared for power plant operations, cost of electricity, stranded assets, and emissions. The results show that there is a significant cost advantage for plants covered under power purchase agreements which favors the operations of older inefficient power plants in baseline scenarios. In addition, the representation of power purchase agreements raises the cost of electricity by 26 percent. A change in operating strategy from least cost to least emissions with a lower demand growth scenario can mitigate 24 percent emissions. The cost of carbon abatement is 268-277 USD/tonne for policy scenarios. Options like renegotiation of power purchase agreements can be considered to mitigate emissions.

Emissions abatement is one of the main challenges faced by different governments. Firstly, the emissions should be estimated, and two types of responsibilities or focuses stand out, the producer's and the consumer's. Based on the Multiregional Input-Output Methodology, this study determines Ecuador's responsibility in terms of CO2 emissions. It defines the economic sectors that have the greatest representation in these emissions, as well as establishing an assessment at the level of the Trade Balance. To do so, the EORA database was used. There has been a strong growth of Ecuador's Footprint of 145.26% from 2000 to 2015, with the transport and secondary sectors having the highest representation and the trade with the BRICS nations standing out. This result strengthens the need to foster a change in the consumption patterns of the population and the public administrations. It is therefore recommended that the authorities allocate part of the public budget to measures oriented to sustainable consumption. Amongst other measures, it would be advisable to extend the RENOVA Plan to private vehicles, as well as to launch awareness campaigns on the degree of sustainability of imported products. These types of measures could stop the strong growth in emissions per capita, essential to reduce the country's carbon footprint.

Consequently, a deep understanding of its emission patterns and the corresponding driving factors are of great importance for exploring the untapped potential of household. However, how to accurately capture household emission features still demand further support from both data and method development. To bridge this knowledge gap, we try to use machine learning technology, which is well linked to the micro-level household survey data, to identify key determinants that could explain the household home-energy consumption and associated emissions. Here, we investigate the household CO2 emissions based on a representative survey which covers 31,133 households in Japan. Six types of machine learning process are employed to find key factors determining to different household emission patterns. Results show that demographic structure, average age and electricity-intensive appliances (electric water heaters, electric heaters, etc.) are most significant driving factors that explain differences in household emissions. Results also further verified that differences in driving factors can be observed in identifying various household emission patterns. The results of study provide vital information for the customized decarbonization pathways for households, as well as discussing further energy-saving behaviours from data-oriented method.

Heat pumps are widely adopted for this purpose. However, the impact of this policy on existing electrical systems, both from the perspectives of supply and demand, is understudied in the literature. This paper examines the system-wide impacts of integrating high quantities of heat pumps, in line with government targets, in Ireland. We provide a broad discussion of the ramifications of heating sector electrification in terms of system costs and expansion planning under renewable energy targets. Results reveal significant changes in generation and increases in associated costs with increasing levels of electrification. On the flip side, the heating sector electrification leads to more efficient utilisation of renewable energy and the transmission network. We also explore alternative policy pathways to minimize impacts on the system. These include determining optimal locations for heat pump integration and a technology-neutral emission reduction target. Optimal distribution of heat pumps has a low impact on system metrics whereas pursuing an emission reduction target makes a large impact on system costs.

J	Dodds, PE; Demoullin, S				Dodds, Paul E.; Demoullin, Stephanie			Conversion of the UK gas system to transport hydrogen	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY			English	Article						Natural gas conversion; UK MARKAL; Energy system model; Hydrogen networks; Gas decarbonisation	NATURAL-GAS; INFRASTRUCTURE	One option to decarbonise residential heat in the UK is to convert the existing natural gas networks to deliver hydrogen. We review the technical feasibility of this option using semi-structured interviews underpinned by a literature review and we assess the potential economic benefits using the UK MARKAL energy systems model. We conclude that hydrogen can be transported safely in the low-pressure pipes but we identify concerns over the reduced capacity of the system and the much lower linepack storage compared to natural gas. New hydrogen meters and sensors would have to be fitted to every building in a hydrogen conversion program and appliances would have to be converted unless the government was to legislate to make them hydrogen-ready in advance. Converting the gas networks to hydrogen is a lower-cost residential decarbonisation pathway for the UK than those identified previously. The cost-optimal share of hydrogen is sensitive to the conversion cost and to variations in the capital costs of heat pumps and micro-CHP fuel cells. With such small cost differentials between technologies, the decision to convert the networks will also depend on non-economic factors including the relative performance of technologies and the willingness of the government to organise a conversion program.

The iron and steel, cement and refining sectors are particularly energy-intensive, together making up over 30% of total industrial energy consumption and producing millions of tonnes of CO2 per year. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of the technologies for reducing emissions from industrial processes by collating information from a wide range of sources. The paper begins with a summary of energy consumption and emissions in the industrial sector. This is followed by a detailed description of process improvements in the three sectors mentioned above, as well as cross-cutting technologies that are relevant to many industries. Lastly, a discussion of the effectiveness of government policies to facilitate the adoption of those technologies is presented. Whilst there has been significant improvement in energy efficiency in recent years, cost-effective energy efficient options still remain. Key energy efficiency measures include upgrading process units to Best Practice, installing new electrical equipment such as pumps and even replacing the process completely. However, these are insufficient to achieve the deep carbon reductions required if we are to avoid dangerous climate change. The paper concludes with recommendations for action to achieve further decarbonisation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Napp, T. A.; Gambhir, A.; Hills, T.

This article aims to discuss the potential of a hydrogen economy examining its ability to reduce dependency on fossil fuels sourced both domestically and internationally. A snapshot of the hydrogen economy is presented introducing the latest development in hydrogen production technologies and distribution infrastructure. It has been postulated that with the intro-duction of a CO2 tax, integrating carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) systems with commercial hydrogen production technologies such as steam methane reforming (SMR), coal gasification (CG) and biomass gasification could significantly reduce the levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH) production. The role of hydrogen and fuel cell technology in coupling the building, transport and industrial sectors has been demonstrated. Decarbonisation of heat in the UK is expected to incur a large cost for transitioning the incumbent network and it is expected that government assistance will be necessary to lessen the burden on consumers. Deployment of fuel cell combined heat and power (CHP) systems and integration into the UK ES could make great strides towards improving its security.

It establishes a comparative game model for two cases of remanufacturing enterprises respectively producing low-quality and high-quality remanufactured products. In the context of government subsidies for only high-quality remanufactured products, we investigate the effects of government subsidies on remanufactured products' forms, prices, profits, and consumer preferences. The results show that government subsidies for high-quality remanufactured products help not only reduce the quality cost of remanufactured products and lower the wholesale and retail prices but also increase consumer preference for high-quality remanufactured products, enhance the market demand for remanufactured products, and promote scale expansion of the remanufacturing industry. This study provides decision support for governments to formulate subsidy coefficients for remanufacturing enterprises, offers theoretical and methodological support for the decarbonization and scale-up of remanufacturing and reduction of environmental pollution, and has significant practical value for achieving carbon peak and carbon neutralization goals.

A key factor in the US is to reduce the on-site combustion of fossil fuels for heating end-uses and to replace this with use of electric heat pump technologies connected to a low-carbon grid. The replacement of natural gas furnaces with electric heat pumps is a key home decarbonization strategy. However, the potential for space heating electrification to reduce greenhouse gas emissions depends on the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) content of the electricity used by the heat pump. This varies considerably depending on the source of electricity, with large state to state variability. Furthermore, household energy costs are likely to be impacted by the electrification of space heating, because retail energy prices for both natural gas and electricity in each state vary by factors of seven and four, respectively. Contractors, energy programs, government and building code officials, as well as consumers need clear indications of the likely CO(2)e and energy cost impacts of proposed electrification projects, because these will affect decarbonization choices and rationales around scaled heating electrification. Government and utility programs also need to be aware of the likely outcomes of any supported/incentivized measures. In this paper, we investigate these effects by looking at new metrics to analyze the change in CO(2)e emitted and the cost to meet home heating loads when switching from a natural gas furnace to a heat pump for the contiguous 48 states of the mainland US.

Logistics form an essential part of the CSC in terms of costs and project management. In turn, transportation accounts for more than half the logistics costs due to construction materials being low-cost/high-volume, and most other logistics processes being business processes and not physical ones. Construction transport is almost entirely road bound, one of the least sustainable modes with externalities far out of proportion to its numbers. Ergo, its optimisation presents substantial greening (de-carbonisation) opportunity, with potentially far-reaching sustainability impacts. The ASI (Avoid-Shift-Improve) concept considers activity, modal structure, and energy intensity/efficiency as transport carbon components, providing a fundamental optimisation framework. 93% of New Zealand's freight (a third of it construction related) is road bound, with 99% fossil-fuel (diesel) dependence. Government adoption of ASI elements viz Supply Chain (SC) efficiency, transport optimisation, data/information sharing, and collaboration for transport decarbonisation aligns with Industry 5.0, but seeks further research for concrete implementation pathways. This paper aims to bridge the gap by proposing a research framework for greening of construction transport as a sustainability enabler for New Zealand.

J	Ma, D; Chen, WY; Yin, X; Wang, LN				Ma, Ding; Chen, Wenying; Yin, Xiang; Wang, Lining			Quantifying the co-benefits of decarbonisation in China's steel sector: An integrated assessment approach	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Integrated assessment approach; Carbon mitigation; Air pollution; Co-benefits; Steel sector	ENERGY EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT; AIR-POLLUTION; DAILY MORTALITY; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASES; HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS; EMISSION REDUCTION; EXTERNAL COSTS; IRON; HEALTH; CONSERVATION	The rapid growth of energy consumption in China has led to increased emissions of CO2. As a response, the Chinese government has proposed a series of carbon mitigation strategies, such as switching the production structure and implementing energy-saving and emission-reduction technologies in energy-intensive sectors. In this paper, an integrated assessment approach was developed by combining the Stock-based model, the China-TIMES model and the co-benefits analysis model. The approach was applied to China's steel sector to simulate the trends of energy consumption and air emissions (CO2, SO2, NOx, and PM10) during 2010-2050, under a reference scenario and three alternative carbon mitigation scenarios. The model quantified the air emission reductions, water conservation, and associated co-benefits during the study period. The modeling results show that by switching the production structure and implementing energy-saving and emission-reduction technologies, China's steel sector can achieve significant co-benefits of carbon mitigation, water conservation, averted mortality and averted morbidity. Despite certain limitations and uncertainties associated with the elements of the integrated assessment approach, the results demonstrate that substantial social benefits and health effects could be realized through carbon mitigation strategies in China's steel sector.

Anticipating these impacts is a growing concern for both investors and regulators. We present an integrated assessment of energy transition risk that links future energy scenarios to a structural economic model. The methodology allows for a comprehensive evaluation of potential financial stresses on firms subject to binding emissions constraints. We pilot the methodology using electric utilities in the 28 European Union member states as our sample. Our results show that aggressive climate mitigation policies affect both net profit margins and the required rate of capital expenditure. We present initial estimates of changes in equity returns and credit quality for these firms, as well as implications for future policymaking.

J	Ball-Burack, A; Salas, P; Mercure, JF				Ball-Burack, Ari; Salas, Pablo; Mercure, Jean-Francois			Great power, great responsibility: Assessing power sector policy for the UK's net zero target	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Climate policy; Emissions reductions pathways; Energy systems modelling; Negative emissions; Net zero	TECHNOLOGICAL-CHANGE; ENERGY; IMPACTS; SYSTEMS; MODEL; DECARBONIZATION; EMISSIONS; TRANSPORT	UK power sector decarbonisation is an important step toward achieving the country's 2050 net zero target. Two uncertainties are particularly relevant to this effort: future electricity demand and biomass availability, the latter due to the potential for negative emissions in the power sector from biomass energy with carbon capture and storage. Using the dynamic simulation model FTT:Power, this work explores the impacts of different power sector policy portfolios on emissions, electricity prices, and government spending under these uncertainties. It finds that deep decarbonisation of the UK power sector is possible, including substantial negative emissions, but that this will require ambitious and diversified policy. Carbon pricing is found to be the single most important decarbonisation policy instrument. Direct regulatory phase-out of unabated fossil fuel power generation is similarly crucial for power sector decarbonisation, and for building resilience to biomass availability uncertainty. That said, under all policy portfolios biomass availability plays a key role in enabling net negative emissions in the power sector. This suggests the importance of securing and improving UK biomass supply, and of decarbonisation outside the power sector to reduce the need for negative emissions to begin with.

We analyze SMEs as a group, and study whether their size affects this process and, in both cases, we examine evolution over time. We use a database comprising 1161 observations of SMEs, 466 in 2014, and 695 in 2016. The results show that SMEs' value propositions give an intermediate valuation to both legally required and voluntary reduction of environmental impact, irrespective of SME size and the year analyzed. Regarding value creation, SMEs adopt practically no environmental practices, and there are significant differences according to size, with more difficulties than advantages stemming from small size. The study also shows that such environmental practices are not effective in reducing carbon. This diagnosis indicates that SMEs need help from the administration if they are to play a key role in the process of transformation toward a low-carbon economy. Legislative actions involving harsher environmental protection measures might help shape value propositions that place greater importance on reducing environmental impact, whereas training actions on available environmental techniques, promotion of research on how to adapt such techniques to SMEs and the development of specific practices for SMEs might enhance environmental value creation and capture in their BMs.	[Quintas, Maria A.; Martinez-Senra, Ana I.; Sartal, Antonio] Univ Vigo, Fac Econ, Dept Business Management & Mkt, Campus Univ S-N, Vigo 36310, Spain	Universidade de Vigo	Martinez-Senra, AI (corresponding author), Univ Vigo, Fac Econ, Dept Business Management & Mkt, Campus Univ S-N, Vigo 36310, Spain.	quintas@uvigo.es; aimtnez@uvigo.es; antoniosartal@uvigo.es	Quintás, María A./F-5545-2016; Martínez-Senra, Ana/G-2799-2014	Quintás, María A./0000-0002-8857-2200; Martínez-Senra, Ana/0000-0003-2534-2245	Spanish Government [ECO2016-76625-R]	Spanish Government(Spanish GovernmentEuropean Commission)	This work has received financial support from the Spanish Government through grant ECO2016-76625-R.		127	12	12	7	38	MDPI	BASEL	ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND		2071-1050		SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL	Sustainability	JUN	2018	10	6							2109	10.3390/su10062109	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10062109			20	Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)	Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology	GK9LE		Green Submitted, Green Published, gold			2022-12-14	WOS:000436570100421

Related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions counteract sectoral development as climate impacts have begun to severely reduce the attractiveness of destinations. This is valid especially for disaster-prone SIDS where slow and rapid onsetting phenomena and severe, frequent weather events are already experienced, increasingly putting tourist assets, infrastructure, local livelihoods and unique biodiversity under pressure. Against this background, this review synthesizes the recent climate change and tourism literature relating to main SIDS regions, highlighting what is at risk. The authors provide latest evidence of the role tourism plays for these islands and elaborate the peculiar climate risks, impacts and consequences for tourism development. The current state of adaptation is explored and research priorities in SIDS regions are highlighted. Whereas SIDS show high mitigation ambition, the significance of CO2 emissions along the value chain and especially related to the transport to SIDS destinations remains a problem that developed nations must address in their national emission reduction plans. Further research at the interface of climate change and tourism is needed, contributing to the decarbonisation of tourism and successful adaptation in SIDS.

Considering the dual role as portfolio manager and partial owner, we analyze carbon risk for investors both in terms of exposure to portfolio values and in terms of responsibility as shareholder of carbon-intensive firms. We show that among various investor types, the preference for holding carbon-intensive stocks differs substantially, even when considering traditional investment decision parameters. In particular, it is governments whose portfolio values are most threatened by a carbon risk exposure of 49%, but at the same time, they prefer larger ownership shares in polluting firms. In contrast, individual investors, investment advisors, and mutual funds avoid holding stakes in these firms, while revealing only a moderate exposure of their assets to carbon risk. In view of the Paris Agreement, which includes the consistent steering of financial flows towards a low carbon transformation of the economy, our study provides policymakers with important implications regarding the coverage and effects of respective regulations. By identifying the ownership structures of carbon-intensive firms and respective owners' portfolio compositions, we also offer implications for further research on portfolio decarbonization and shareholders' influence of corporate carbon management.

J	Smart, K				Smart, Katie			Review of Recent Progress in Green Ammonia Synthesis Decarbonisation of fertiliser and fuels via green synthesis	JOHNSON MATTHEY TECHNOLOGY REVIEW			English	Review							NITROGEN-FIXATION; NANOSHEETS; CATALYST; STORAGE	Most of the global production of ammonia requires fossil fuels and is associated with considerable greenhouse gas emissions. Replacing fossil fuel ammonia with green or zero-carbon ammonia is a major focus for academia, industry and governments. Ammonia is a key component in fertiliser but is also attracting increasing interest as a carbon-free fuel for the maritime sector and as a hydrogen vector. This review describes the use of green (electrolysed) hydrogen in conventional Haber-Bosch plants and predicts adoption of the technology by 2030. Further into the future, direct green ammonia synthesis by electrocatalytic and photocatalytic means may present a cost-effective alternative to the Haber-Bosch process. Electrocatalytic and photocatalytic routes to ammonia are reviewed, the catalytic systems are compared and their potential for meeting the likely demand and cost for ammonia considered.

This paper, therefore, describes three potential decarbonization pathways to analyze different effects for the electricity, transport, heating, and industrial sectors until 2050. Using an enhanced version of the multi-sectoral, open-source Global Energy System Model, enables us to assess the impact of different CO2 budgets on the upcoming energy system transformation. A detailed provincial resolution allows for the implementation of regional characteristics and disparities within China. Conclusively, we complement the model-based analysis with a quantitative assessment of current barriers for the needed transformation. Results indicate that overall energy system CO2 emissions and in particular coal usage have to be reduced drastically to meet (inter-) national climate targets. Specifically, coal consumption has to decrease by around 60% in 2050 compared to 2015. The current Nationally Determined Contributions proposed by the Chinese government of peaking emissions in 2030 are, therefore, not sufficient to comply with a global CO2 budget in line with the Paris Agreement. Renewable energies, in particular photovoltaics and onshore wind, profit from decreasing costs and can provide a more sustainable and cheaper energy source. Furthermore, increased stakeholder interactions and incentives are needed to mitigate the resistance of local actors against a low-carbon transformation.

Identifying contributing factors to China's declining share of renewable energy consumption: no silver bullet to decarbonisation	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article						Artificial neural network (ANN); Automatic linear modeling (ALM); Environment; Sustainability; IBM SPSS; Pearson and Spearman rank correlation; Regression analysis	FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; COMBUSTIBLE RENEWABLES; WASTE CONSUMPTION; CO2 EMISSIONS; FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT; COUNTRIES; IMPACT	Renewable energy consumption (REC) holds the key to sustainable development. Therefore, many studies have considered the role of REC. However, the factors influencing the REC share in total energy usage (SREC) are not well investigated. Especially, the factors of China's fast-shrinking SREC are understudied. This research void on the world's largest renewable energy producer and consumer, i.e., China's decreasing SREC, is alarming and requires thorough investigation. Our study intends to fill this gap by analyzing the factors of China's decreasing SREC. The study uses both the conventional (descriptive and directional correlational analyses) and some unconventional (automatic linear modeling (ALM) and Artificial neural network (ANN) multilayer perceptron (MLP)) approach to investigate the factors of China's decreasing SREC. The initial hypothesis testing and most reliable model validation were achieved via directional correlational (Pearson and Spearman) and ALM analyses. The ANN MLP (two hidden layers) indicated that the most critical factor is "Combustible renewables and waste," with a 100% normalized importance. It was followed by "urbanization (64.2%), gross savings (56.1%), and alternative and nuclear energy (38%)," respectively. It is suggested that the Chinese government and private investors prioritize their investments based on factors' importance ranking.

Three decades later, consumption-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have continued to increase. To achieve well below 2 degrees C' and 1.5 degrees C goals, consumption-related emissions must be substantially reduced in the coming decades. This paper provides insights on how to pursue 1.5 degrees C pathways through changes in household consumption. It draws on original data gathered in the project HOusehold Preferences for reducing greenhouse gas Emissions in four European High Income Countries' (HOPE) to analyse policies targeting and affecting direct and indirect GHG emissions in three household consumption categories (mobility, housing and food) in four countries (France, Germany, Norway and Sweden) and four medium-sized cities. This paper demonstrates discrepancies and similarities between current governmental policy approaches in the four countries and household perceptions of consumption changes with respect to policy mechanisms, responsibilities and space for acting on mitigation. Current demand-side policy strategies rely heavily on instruments of self-governance and nudging behaviour. Whilst some of our data suggests that households broadly accept this, it also suggests that governments could more actively lead and steer demand-side mitigation via adjusting and supplementing a comprehensive list of 20 climate policy measures currently in place in one or more of the case countries. The paper concludes by suggesting areas for more effective policy change and household-level climate change mitigation to feed the next update of climate pledges under the Paris Agreement.

Building-level heat demand mapping of commercial-residential areas for simulated district heating assessments in Montana, Idaho, and Washington	ENERGY AND BUILDINGS			English	Article						District heating; Simulation; GIS; Sustainable energy; Building stock decarbonization; Municipal planning	DISTRIBUTION COSTS; DESIGN	Depending on the climate zone, structure composition, and industry of a place, building heating in the United States can account for 40-60% of total community energy demand. Providing sustainable energy sources to meet this demand is crucial for emissions mitigation. District heating (DH) is energy agnostic, allowing a community to leverage low-or no-emission, locally occurring, natural and fabricated heat sources. The United States, while being the greatest energy consumer on a per capita basis, lacks the heat demand mapping intelligence necessary to plan for DH potential across communities. This work provides a method to map building-level heat demand using energy consumption surveys and property tax information in the absence of proprietary gas and electric utility data. Three demonstration municipalities in this work are from Washington, Idaho, and Montana. With demand mapping readily available in these areas and elsewhere, the policymaker, planner, and developer can quickly assess system potentials using Comsof Heat, a techno-economic simulation software for DH planning. This software auto-routes the necessary pipe networks along the lowest-cost pathways through a community to meet peak demand, providing multi-heat source integration. The constructed heat demand maps from these communities are imported to Comsof Heat to explore the hypothetical energy sources, payback periods, and decarbonization of building stocks using DH. Inconsistencies in structural data exist in property tax information across state, county, and municipal governments. These inconsistences can lead to uncertainties in heat demand mapping that could easily be overcome through greater coordination by local and regional GIS managers. Despite these uncertainties, it is still possible to characterize most commercial-residential heat demand across municipalities in Washington, Idaho, and Montana. These preliminary heat demand maps should be a public-facing product available from governments. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we present a detailed description of a novel method for exploring local energy systems change with residents of Port Talbot, an industrial town in south Wales. Our persona-based approach asked small groups of local residents to explore place-based scenarios for energy systems change through the development of local characters or 'personas'. By situating deliberation within a local context and grounding it in the emotional relationships that matter in residents' everyday lives, persona-based exploration provides a useful foundation upon which to conduct deliberation of complex socio-technical energy issues that can otherwise be presented and interpreted as quite abstract and technical visions of change. In particular we illustrate how this approach allowed participants to open up about their personal lives, as well as eliciting more sympathetic consideration of the needs of others by better orienting participants to the issues of vulnerability within their communities. Two key processes of persona development enabled this: 1) the incorporation of personal identities, circumstances, or histories (both of themselves or friends/family) within personas, and 2) the embodiment of shared social understandings of local industrial and community decline within personas. As such, we believe that persona-based exploration offers a valuable tool for deepening emotional and context specific public deliberations around energy systems transitions and sociotechnical change more broadly.

These methods were demonstrated on the local authority area of Neath Port Talbot in the UK. The estimated heat demand was validated against real data. The modelling results obtained show that significant financial support is required for low carbon heating technologies such as heat pumps and district heating networks for them to play a major role in the decarbonisation of heat.

Strong cases have recently been made for acknowledging the decarbonisation potential lying in transforming linear economic models into closed-loop industrial ecosystems and in shifting lifestyle patterns towards this direction. This perspective highlights the research capacity needed to inform on the role and potential of the circular economy for climate change mitigation and to enhance the scientific capabilities to quantitatively explore their synergies and trade-offs. This begins with establishing conceptual and methodological bridges amongst the relevant and currently fragmented research communities, thereby allowing an interdisciplinary integration and assessment of circularity, decarbonisation, and sustainable development. Following similar calls for science in support of climate action, a transdisciplinary scientific agenda is needed to co-create the goals and scientific processes underpinning the transition pathways towards a circular, net-zero economy with representatives from policy, industry, and civil society. Here, it is argued that such integration of disciplines, methods, and communities can then lead to new and/or structurally enhanced quantitative systems models that better represent critical industrial value chains, consumption patterns, and mitigation technologies. This will be a crucial advancement towards assessing the material implications of, and the contribution of enhanced circularity performance to, mitigation pathways that are compatible with the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement and the transition to a circular economy.(c) 2021 The Authors.

The benefit of mobilising community level action in addressing climate change action has already been seen in many European countries. While Irish governmental policy envisions as necessary greater community involvement in energy projects and other efforts to reduce carbon emissions, little progress has been encouraging or supporting such action. Using the Q-method, this study examined and identified where commonalities exist in Irish communities that have successfully implemented sustainable development goals, in terms of their motivation, attitudes, perceived barriers and opportunities for continued action. Results indicate that participants' main motivations are derived from a sense of responsibility to future generations and the need to live more balanced lifestyles. Results further suggest that short-term central government strategy, poor support, bureaucracy, and a lack of collaboration are seen as key limitations in developing and achieving effective community level sustainability action. This study contributes in understanding how climate change policy can be aligned to the preferred future vision of communities in bringing about effective change in transitioning to a low-carbon society.

We find that (1) Place-based resistance movements are succeeding in curbing both fossil-fuel and low-carbon energy projects. Over a quarter of projects encountering social resistance have been cancelled, suspended or delayed. (2) The evidence highlights that low carbon, renewable energy and mitigation projects are as conflictive as FF projects, and that both disproportionately impact vulnerable groups such as rural communities and Indigenous peoples. Amongst LCE projects, hydropower was found to have the highest number of conflicts with concerns over social and environmental damages. (3) Repression and violence against protesters and land defenders was rife in almost all activities, with 10% of all cases analysed involving assassination of activists. Violence was particularly common in relation to hydropower, biomass, pipelines and coal extraction. Wind, solar and other renewables were the least conflictive and entailed lower levels of repression than other projects. The results caution that decarbonization of the economy is by no means inherently environmentally innocuous or socially inclusive. We find that conflicts and collective action are driven by multiple concerns through which community mobilization seeks to reshape the energy regime and its impacts. These include claims for localization, democratic participation, shorter energy chains, anti-racism, climate-justice-focused governance, and Indigenous leadership. Climate and energy policymakers need to pay closer attention to the demands and preferences of these collective movements pointing to transformative pathways to decarbonization.

Assessing natural gas subsidy and energy efficiency policy interactions amid CO2 emissions reduction in Malaysia electricity sector	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Natural gas subsidy; Energy efficiency; Policy interactions; Agent-based computational economic model; Electricity decarbonisation		One of the negative environmental consequences of natural gas subsidy (NGS) is that it stimulates the substitution from low carbon generating technologies to natural gas, and thus hinders the timely electricity decarbonisation. To manage Malaysia's energy consumption and consequently reduce its energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, there has been renewed interest in removing NGS. In policy debates, it is a commonly held belief that NGS stimulates excessive energy consumption, and thus phasing it out would reduce electricity-related greenhouse gas emissions. However, whether this is the real situation and the emission reduction potential of phasing out NGS along with energy efficiency measures are still unanswered. Here we build an agent-based computational economic model with six types of agents (electricity producer, government, consumer, environment, electricity, and fuel markets). A simulation toolbox is developed to explore the dynamics of the electricity sector under different scenarios between 2015 and 2050. It is shown that removing NGS alone cannot lead to low carbon emissions because its removal would only instigate the substitution from low carbon technologies to the coal-fired plants. Two average annual growth rates of electricity demand have been simulated for energy efficiency policies. The simulation results show that the lower the rate of annual demand growth, the lower the growth rate of electricity output, and ultimately, the lower the energy-related CO2 emissions. With these two policies alone, CO2 emissions will continue to grow. Our results finally demonstrate that for the Malaysian government to achieve its emission reduction targets, additional efforts and policies will be required. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

This must occur against a background of continuing urbanisation and the shift to the information economy. While replacement of fossil fuels in electricity generation is underway, urban transport is currently dominated by petrol and diesel-powered vehicles. The City of the Future will need to be built around a different transport and urban paradigm. This article argues that the new model will be a polycentric city linked by fast electric rail, with local access based on autonomous "community"-owned electric cars and buses supplemented by bicycles, electric bikes and scooters, with all electricity generated from renewables. Less space will be wasted on roads and parking, enabling higher accessibility yet more usable public open space. Building the cities of the future will require national governments to accelerate local initiatives through appropriate policy settings and strategic investment. The precise way in which individual cities move into the future will vary, and the article illustrates how the transformation could work for Australian cities, like Sydney, currently some of the most car dependent in the world, using new financial and city partnerships.'

To this end, an adaptive robust optimization approach is proposed for the expansion planning problem of a distribution system where expansion decisions involve the construction of renewable generating units, storage units, and charging stations for electric vehicles. The problem is formulated under the perspective of a central planner that aims at determining the expansion plan that minimizes both investment and operation costs. Both short-term variability and long-term uncertainty are considered in the proposed approach and are modeled in different ways. Short-term variability of the demand, the production of stochastic units, and the price of electricity withdrawn from or injected into the transmission system is modeled using a number of representative days corresponding to different operating conditions. Long-term uncertainty in the future peak demands, the future value of electricity exchanged with the transmission grid, and the number of electric vehicles is instead modeled through confidence bounds. A case study based on a 69-node distribution network shows the effectiveness of the proposed technique and the relationship between the optimal expansions decisions, the revenues from selling electricity to the electric vehicles, the degree of independence from the transmission system, and the role played by the investment budget availability. Moreover, an ex-post decarbonization analysis is conducted to evaluate the environmental impact of the adoption of electric vehicles. Finally, the proposed approach outperforms the results of a stochastic model in terms of computational performance.

Special attention is paid to the prospects for the development of the Russian hydrogen market. The authors of the review used the method of comparative analysis and analytical generalization of publications, programs and regulatory documents from different countries. The results of the comparative analysis led to the conclusion that most of the publications currently focus on the technical and technological aspects of hydrogen energy, solving the problem of increasing the efficiency of methods for the production, transportation, distribution and storage of hydrogen fuel. The results of the analytical generalization led to the conclusion that in all countries of the world, the technology for the production of highly environmentally friendly "green" hydrogen is at an early stage, which makes it highly dependent on government initiatives to develop hydrogen projects and government funding of both scientific research in this area and realizable projects. In addition, the peaks of interest in the field of hydrogen energy are associated with market changes in the fossil energy markets, which makes the development of this technology unstable and dependent on market conditions. Moreover, the focus of attention of a number of authors is the prospects for the development of the hydrogen market. It is concluded that many countries are ready to invest in the development of hydrogen energy and, given the growth in demand for hydrogen, are ready to export it at an affordable price. That is, in the future, the international hydrogen market, as technical, technological, and economic problems are solved, will grow. The results of the study also indicate the fundamental co-direction of the trends in the development of hydrogen energy in Russia with global trends. At the same time, it should be emphasized that the high resource and scientific and technological potential allows Russia to fully focus its strategy on its implementation, not only developing the domestic market but also acting as an exporter of hydrogen and expanding international cooperation in this area.

The first of the two is losing support due to the decline of Poland's significance as a transit state for the Russian export. Given lack of upstream capacity, the position of the latter is also very weak. The excess supply of refinery services across the European continent reduces its development opportunities. The electrical power engineering alike, leaves much to be desired. The production area is dominated by entities more than half a century old. The over-exploited and useless power units are not replaced by any new ones featuring the power close to the withdrawn items. Majority of professional power plants are coal operated. The climate changes and the resulting restrictive UE policy in terms of greenhouse gases emission, including carbon dioxide, successfully contribute to the decarbonisation of the power production in the region. This process will cover also Poland. Awareness of the issue seems to emerge from the government's state of mind. The electromobility plan meets all the preconditions to become an element of support to the power transformation process in Poland. The car market is well developed and plays a significant role. Although used cars imported privately dominate in the streets, the share of new vehicles rises on a year to year basis. CO2 emission-based restrictions and penalties imposed on the manufacturers lead to the eventual removal of traditional combustion engines driven cars. The rising number of PHEV and EV indicates not only the higher demand for electric power, an increase in its production in other words, but a complete remake of the distribution infrastructure as well. The problem is clear to see in big agglomeration suburbs inhabited by wealthy society. Microgeneration development seems to be the only hope here.

Such an analysis covers the timeframe 2011-2050, thus allowing to assess if the environment friendliness of both PHEV and BEV will be enough contributing, particularly towards the fulfillment of the objectives recently established both by official agreements among governments and research consortia (e.g. the International Energy Agency) as well. The expected time evolution of both PHEV and BEV private car fleets is modeled through a simplified market penetration model, along with the associated contribution in terms of well to tank and tank to wheel GHG emissions, thus providing the needed input data to the scenario analysis. Particularly, a longitudinal vehicle model is adopted to accurately estimate electric vehicle energy consumptions and related GHG emissions as a function of powertrain configuration, dimensions and mass. The analysis was run on several countries, thus providing useful outcomes to assess the suitability of given energy mix to fully exploit vehicle electrification. Such indications will therefore be useful to determine to which extent progressive decarbonization of current grids is required to meet the GHG reduction target by 2050. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the design, focus and timeframe for policy support are proving challenging in countries like the UK, where industry actors are concerned about the competitiveness implications of additional operational capital costs, while government aims to offer only transitory policy support. Policy-facing research is required to understand the drivers, nature and extent of potential competitiveness loss from adopting carbon capture in specific industry and country contexts, along with the impacts of policy decisions in other countries and of possible future technology improvements. We consider the case of the UK chemicals industry, using an economy-wide computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. This highlights how macroeconomic and sectoral impacts of concern under regional, industry and climate policy agendas depend on domestic and export demand responses to changing industry prices. A crucial question is whether capture costs are similarly reflected in international prices. We identify a risk of policy commitment to 'polluter pays' having sustained negative outcomes for capture firms, along with offshoring/leakage of jobs and GDP, and associated emissions, as demand shifts to lower cost overseas production. However, such costs could be reduced, and some capture industry gains realised, if competitors in other nations ultimately follow in bearing similar costs and particularly if 'early mover' action enables firms to make efficiency gains and build comparative advantage in operational carbon capture. Key policy insights A 'polluter pays' approach to industrial carbon capture risks triggering potential 'offshoring' of manufacturing activity in all timeframes where increased operational costs reduce the relative competitiveness of capture firms. A border tax risks worse industry and wider economy outcomes, where domestic production is intensive in imports of the commodity in question. Transitory policy support should focus on enabling capture firms to build efficiency in using carbon capture equipment while sustaining competitiveness and jobs within regional industry clusters. Opportunities should be explored to develop comparative advantage where policy activity involves 'early mover' action on carbon capture.

Global agreements like the "2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development" or the "Paris Agreement on Climate Change" seek to promote sustainable development and its integration in policymaking. Against this backdrop, the Government of Japan in its Fifth Basic Environment Plan of 2018 proposed the concept of the Circulating and Ecological Sphere (CES) to guide sustainable transitions in light of the sustainable development goals (SDGs). The CES provides a framework for a new paradigm in sustainable development bringing together existing approaches, namely, rural-urban linkages, ecosystem-based solutions, decarbonisation, and resource circulation. Still in an embryonic stage, some regional and local authorities in Japan have started to experiment with ways to apply this concept on the ground. Drawing on a systematic literature review on the different components covered by the CES, along with analysis of a case study in Suzu, Japan, this paper explores how this new concept can contribute to achieve a sustainable future.

J	Meckling, J; Strecker, J				Meckling, Jonas; Strecker, Jesse			Green bargains: leveraging public investment to advance climate regulation	CLIMATE POLICY			English	Article; Early Access						Public investment; climate regulation; recovery spending; conditionality	INDUSTRIAL-POLICY	Climate policy has entered a new era as public investment is increasingly moving to center stage, including recovery spending and long-term climate investment plans. While essential for decarbonization, public investment is not enough - the carrots of investment need to go hand in hand with regulatory sticks. Public investment in clean technologies and infrastructure does not guarantee decarbonization outcomes. Yet, climate regulation, particularly high and comprehensive carbon prices, has remained elusive in the United States and many other parts of the world. Against this backdrop, the big public investment push offers a political opportunity of government leverage. Governments can tie climate requirements to public investment as part of a 'green bargain.' At the core of these arrangements is reciprocity - linking carrots to sticks - to ensure public investment leads to technological change and emission reductions. Drawing on the experience with 'reciprocal control mechanisms' in public investment among late industrializers, this paper advances our understanding of green bargains. It examines the historical precedents of green bargains, introduces a typology, and offers an empirical overview based on an original dataset of implemented and proposed green bargains. We then focus on the design choices related to leverage, scope, and accountability to make green bargains effective at technological learning and advancing decarbonization. The article concludes with a discussion of US and international policy fora that can serve as platforms to develop green bargains as public climate investments expand.Key policy insightsScaling public investment for decarbonization is essential but not sufficient. Climate regulation needs to complement investment to ensure decarbonization outcomes. Yet governments, in particular the US, are falling short of needed climate regulation.Public investment offers leverage to tie climate requirements to government spending on clean technology and infrastructure.Linking carrots to sticks represents a 'green bargain' between governments and firms and industries, with reciprocity at its core. This resembles the 'reciprocal control mechanisms' of late industrializers.To make green bargains effective, their design needs to facilitate broad scope, high government leverage, and high accountability.

The combined role of policy and incentives in promoting cost efficient decarbonisation of energy: A case study for biomethane	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Energy policy; Renewable heat incentive; Bioenergy; Biomethane; CO2 emissions	GAS; INJECTION; DIGESTION	The levelized cost of energy of biomethane from food waste was assessed at 87 (sic)/MWh, (87 c/L die-sel(equiv)). Allowing for gate fees the incentive required for financial viability was 0.13 (sic)/m(3) (13 (sic)/MWh). For context, various successful renewable energy policies were analysed across the EU including photovoltaics and biogas in Germany and electric vehicles in Norway. The schemes were compared with an incentive applied (or required) per tCO(2) avoided. For Ireland, this study predicts that biomethane needs a financial subsidy of less than 180 (sic)/tCO(2) avoided, while most successful EU systems offer incentivisation levels less than 260 (sic)/tCO(2) avoided. In terms of incentives per tCO(2) avoided Electric Vehicles (EV) stand out. When including all incentives such as grants and avoided parking costs, EVs can receive a sixteen-fold higher incentive as compared to biomethane based on tCO(2) emissions avoided. The rationale for this high incentive and supporting policy is based on the requirement to initiate a new infrastructure that would not otherwise happen without intervention of a government incentivising decarbonised transport and clean air. Biomethane as a transport fuel requires a very significant change in infrastructure, including the provision of compressed natural gas service stations and natural gas vehicles. Initially (as for other successful renewable energy systems) larger incentives would be required to allow initiation of the industry, but these subsidies can be reduced over time. Biomethane as a transport fuel offers similar rewards as for electric vehicles, decarbonised transport and clean air along with energy security, renewable energy, indigenous jobs and supporting greening of agriculture.

Zero carbon energy system pathways for Ireland consistent with the Paris Agreement	CLIMATE POLICY			English	Article						Carbon budgets; climate change; climate mitigation; decarbonization; equity; ETSAP; integrated energy system models; macroeconomic feedback; Paris Agreement; TIMES-MACRO	EMISSIONS; TARGETS; SCENARIOS; IMPACTS; MACRO	The Paris Agreement is the last hope to keep global temperature rise below 2 degrees C. The consensus agrees to holding the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels, and to aim for 1.5 degrees C. Each Party's successive nationally determined contribution (NDC) will represent a progression beyond the party's then current NDC, and reflect its highest possible ambition. Using Ireland as a test case, we show that increased mitigation ambition is required to meet the Paris Agreement goals in contrast to current EU policy goals of an 80-95% reduction by 2050. For the 1.5 degrees C consistent carbon budgets, the technically feasible scenarios' abatement costs rise to greater than Euro8,100/tCO(2) by 2050. The greatest economic impact is in the short term. Annual GDP growth rates in the period to 2020 reduce from 4% to 2.2% in the 1.5 degrees C scenario. While aiming for net zero emissions beyond 2050, investment decisions in the next 5-10 years are critical to prevent carbon lock-in.Key policy insights Economic growth can be maintained in Ireland while rapidly decarbonizing the energy system.The social cost of carbon needs to be included as standard in valuation of infrastructure investment planning, both by government finance departments and private investors.Technological feasibility is not the limiting factor in achieving rapid deep decarbonization.Immediate increased decarbonization ambition over the next 3-5 years is critical to achieve the Paris Agreement goals, acknowledging the current 80-95% reduction target is not consistent with temperature goals of well below' 2 degrees C and pursuing 1.5 degrees C.Applying carbon budgets to the energy system results in non-linear CO2 emissions reductions over time, which contrast with current EU policy targets, and the implied optimal climate policy and mitigation investment strategy.

J	Golub, A; Lugovoy, O; Potashnikov, V				Golub, Alexander; Lugovoy, Oleg; Potashnikov, Vladimir			Quantifying barriers to decarbonization of the Russian economy: real options analysis of investment risks in low-carbon technologies	CLIMATE POLICY			English	Article						Russia; low-carbon transition; investment risks; real options analysis; barriers to new technologies	RENEWABLE ENERGY	Russia has significant potential for reducing its carbon emissions. However, investment in new low-carbon technologies has significant risks. Ambiguous energy and climate policy in Russia, along with deterioration of the country's investment climate, create investment barriers that are well described in qualitative terms in the literature. This paper attempts to provide a quantitative analysis of these barriers. For this numerical experiment, we apply the RU-TIMES model. Using a real options methodology, we estimate the risk-adjusted cost of capital in the Russian energy sector (including energy production and consumption technologies represented in the TIMES framework) to be approximately 43% (including a risk-free interest rate) and demonstrate the high risk of investment into energy-efficient and low-carbon technologies. Any future low-carbon emissions pathway depends on the ability of the Russian government to reduce climate and energy policy uncertainties, and to reduce financial risks through improvements of the general investment climate. Key policy insights The high cost of capital investment into Russian energy production and consumption may prevent the adoption of new energy-efficient and low-carbon technologies. These investment risks, if not addressed, will delay Russia's low-carbon transition for the coming decades. Adopting a clear and unambiguous long-term climate and energy policy is important to reduce these risks and alleviate some of the barriers to the new technologies. The first step could be ratification of the Paris Agreement and adoption of a long-term emission target for the period up to 2050.

Hydrogen can be used in industry, transport, decarbonisation of the Polish steel industry and as one of the low-emission alternatives to the existing coal applications in this sector. Limiting climate change requires efforts on a global scale from all countries of the world. Significant economic benefits will be realized by stimulating the development of new technologies to deal with climate change. The scenarios show an increasing demand for industrial hydrogen in the future. The key is to replace gray hydrogen with green, and to convert industrial processes, which will create additional hydrogen demand. The condition for the development of a green hydrogen economy is access to adequate installed capacity in renewable energy. Germany will become the leading market in the era of energy transformation in the coming years. The implementation of the hydrogen assumptions in Poland is possible, to a greater extent, by the efforts of entrepreneurs.

One of the key policy issues in Japan's energy and environmental policy arena is the energy system transition to achieve 80% emissions reduction in 2050, a current policy goal set in 2016. To contribute to the ongoing policy debate, this paper focuses on energy-related CO2 emissions and analyzes such decarbonization scenarios that are consistent with the government goals. We employ six energy-economic and integrated assessment models to reveal decarbonization challenges in the energy system. The modeling results show that Japan's mitigation scenarios are characterized by high marginal costs of abatement. They also suggest that the industrial sector is likely to have a large final energy share and significant residual emissions under the 80% reduction scenario, though it is generally thought that the transport sector would have large decarbonization challenges. The present findings imply that not only energy policy but also industrial policy may be relevant to the long-term environmental target. Given the high marginal costs exceeding those of negative emissions technologies that could place a cost ceiling, further model development would be crucial. (C) 2018 The Authors.

J	Adun, H; Ishaku, HP; Ogungbemi, AT				Adun, Humphrey; Ishaku, Hamagham Peter; Ogungbemi, Ayomide Titus			Towards Renewable energy targets for the Middle East and North African region: A decarbonization assessment of energy-water nexus	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Renewable energy; MENA; Hydropower; Solar; Wind energy; Energy targets	REVERSE-OSMOSIS; POWER-PLANTS; DESALINATION; SCENARIO; SYSTEM; POLICY; FUTURE; INTERCONNECTION; OPTIMIZATION; INTEGRATION	Despite their huge fossil fuel potential, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is sensitive to weakness in oil prices and this has a negative effect on the country's finances. Also, only 1.4% of the world's freshwater resources are found in MENA, despite having two-thirds or 66% of the world's known crude oil reserves. Despite that the energy importing countries in the MENA region benefit from lower energy prices, many of the countries like Libya, Syria, and Yemen have been shaken by wars, civil unrest, and political crisis, and this has created immense challenges in the energy situation. Another major challenge facing the MENA region is water scarcity. This region can be described as a desert area. There is a growing need for sustainable water management in the region as water scarcity is becoming increasingly critical. The government in North Africa have over the years set up laudable renewable energy projects to solve the prevailing energy crisis and improve their energy security. However, due to increasing population growth and increasing demand, there is still a huge gap between the renewable energy potential and generation that can be tapped. This study explores an hourly feasibility analysis of renewable energy production for electricity and freshwater production through the desalination process using the EnergyPLAN simulation environment. This study utilizes the planned renewable energy target set by the countries considered: Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya. The result shows that the increment of the renewable share to 52% in 2030 for Moroccos will cause a reduction in carbon emission by 52.09%. The emission recorded for the 2030 scenario for 52% renewable energy integration was 14.209 Mt. This represents a CO2 reduction of 78% from the 64.59 Mt emission in 2018. Also, for the projected 10% renewable electricity production target for Libya, the model shows that solar PV, wind energy, hydropower and CSP can supply a combined 6.61 TWh/year. The estimated technical result indicates that due to the extreme intermittency of renewable energy sources, the most probable scenario for meeting the future electricity demand in North Africa through a regional transmission grid is by hybrid renewable energy installations across the countries. Conclusively, it is presented that the actualization of renewable energy targets requires analysis and implementation of different policy strategies, especially for a region like North Africa, where there is a high reliance on fossil fuels for national revenue.

In democratic societies, citizens' preferences over such combinations are crucial because they shape the political mandates based on which policymakers act. We argue that policy designs that involve privatepublic co-regulation receive more citizen support if they are based on inclusive decision-making, use strong transparency and monitoring mechanisms, and include a trigger for government intervention in case of ineffectiveness. Survey experiments in Switzerland (N = 1941) provide strong support for these arguments. Our research demonstrates that differences in co-regulation design have major implications for public support. Another key finding is that there seems to be a contradiction between inclusiveness and democratic accountability for policy outcomes. The findings are surprisingly consistent across two very different green economy issues we focus on empirically (decarbonization of finance, pesticides). This suggests that our study design offers a useful template for research that explores public opinion on green economy policy designs for other issues and in other countries.

J	Barnes, J; Bhagavathy, SM				Barnes, Jake; Bhagavathy, Sivapriya Mothilal			The economics of heat pumps and the (un)intended consequences of government policy	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Heat pumps; Low carbon space heating; Taxes and levies; Renewable heat incentive	RENEWABLE HEAT; GAS	In Europe, space and water heating account for approximately 80% of final energy use in the domestic sector. For many European countries the electrification of heat provision, via heat pumps (HPs), provides a promising decarbonisation pathway. The UK is no different, but recently concerns have been raised about the financial attractiveness of HPs given how, through various policy choices, taxes and levies are applied more heavily on electricity bills than gas bills. In this paper, we critically examine this argument by assessing the financial attractiveness of HPs across their lifetime for a typical UK household and within the current UK tax and regulatory regime. The results suggest taxes and levies do weaken the economic case for HPs: their current distribution having an unintended impact on the economics of HPs. Nonetheless, they are not the only reason for HPs comparative financial disadvantage. Upfront costs and HP performance, both influence the extent to which taxes and levies impact the economics of HPs. The results have implications for the future deployment of HPs in the UK and point towards policies to increase deployment (to drive down costs) and increase HP performance as being important.

The Case of Poland	ENERGIES			English	Article						energy transition; decarbonization; coal phase-out in Poland; managing the energy transition; critical discourse analysis	COAL; DESTABILIZATION; RESISTANCE; TRANSPORT; FRAMEWORK; DEMOCRACY; DYNAMICS; POLITICS; GERMANY; CHOICE	Since energy transition has become a necessity, many countries are developing decarbonization plans and looking for ways to reduce CO2 emissions. The process takes different forms, most often being affected by local conditions, which means that it takes place in each country differently, due to the country's social and economic specifics. One of the countries that has just started its energy transition process is Poland. The case of Poland is extremely interesting, as it is a country whose economy is still heavily dependent on coal and there are very strong traditions related to this particular source of energy. On the other hand, Poland has two very good reasons to move away from coal. The complexity and comprehensiveness of the energy transition results, among other things, from the diversity of actors involved in this issue and the multiplicity of their, often conflicting, interests. Using a critical discourse analysis, this paper attempts to show how those actors attempt to shape the transition through the discourses which they generate. The study covers the media discourse that took place in Poland between September 2020 and May 2021, i.e., a time when the Polish government negotiated with representatives of the miners' trade unions the terms of Poland's transition from coal. A critical analysis of the texts that appeared in the media during this time provides a picture of how different groups of social actors perceive the transition and how they try to manage that process.</p>	[Krzywda, Joanna; Krzywda, Dariusz] Czestochowa Tech Univ, Fac Management, Dabrowskiego 69, PL-42201 Czestochowa, Poland; [Androniceanu, Armenia] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Adm & Publ Management, 9 Piata Romana, Bucharest 010374, Romania; [Androniceanu, Armenia] Univ Social Sci, Res Dept, Sienkiewicza 9, PL-90113 Lodz, Poland	Technical University Czestochowa; Bucharest University of Economic Studies; University of Social Sciences	Krzywda, J (corresponding author), Czestochowa Tech Univ, Fac Management, Dabrowskiego 69, PL-42201 Czestochowa, Poland.	joanna.krzywda@pcz.pl; dariusz.krzywda@pcz.pl; armenia.androniceanu@man.ase.ro		Androniceanu, Armenia/0000-0001-7307-5597					82	4	4	5	9	MDPI	BASEL	ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND		1996-1073		ENERGIES	Energies	OCT	2021	14	20							6471	10.3390/en14206471	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14206471			23	Energy & Fuels	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)	Energy & Fuels	WU1ZX		gold			2022-12-14	WOS:000716351600001

Previous studies underline the social, political, and economic benefits of the electricity sector decarbonisation. The economic analysis of renewable energy sources (RES) integration is commonly performed with single-bus generation expansion models that seek the cost-optimal expansion of RES generation capacity to reduce operational expenses. However, electricity grids will require investments to adapt to the integration of high amounts of RES capacity. This paper contrasts the cost-optimal generation capacity mix obtained from a single-bus expansion model with a conservative estimation of electricity network investment requirements for an exemplary Spanish-like case study. RES network investment costs are put in context with an alternative non-RES generation expansion pathway. Network investment costs considered include expansion costs for both transmission and distribution grids. Electricity network expansion costs represent 6 to 10% of the corresponding generation capacity investment. Despite increasing network investment costs, the integration of high RES shares into electricity grids reduces operating costs when compared to non-RES pathways. Fuel and emission savings exceed total investments (generation capacity, network expansion, and connection costs). (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We show how CRMs in these countries are evolving from government interventions to deal with electricity system reliability issues to become important policy instruments aimed at addressing a wide range of economic and societal challenges related to decarbonisation. We pay particular attention to the ambiguous role that CRMs play as tools for governing the decarbonisation of electricity systems. On the one hand they are being legitimised by governments as a means of facilitating the integration of renewables, while at the same time they are seen by many actors as a contributor to carbon lock-in and a means of prolonging the fossil-fuel industry. We discuss key factors shaping the ambiguous role of CRMs in electricity system decarbonisation and their relation to the politics of sustainable energy transitions.

Two main tasks are solved when developing the technology for spraying the carbide-containing materials. The relationship is established between the phase composition of tungsten-based coatings and their strength, hardness, and substrate adhesion. It was established that the WC dissolution in the metal phase promotes the increase of substrate adhesion as well as strength and hardness of coating material. A procedure of spraying coatings in the reduction mode is proposed: i.e., using working gas mixtures with excess acetylene. It prevents the decarbonization of WC carbides under the action of detonation products and environment. The phase composition heterogeneity (both along with the layer thickness and along the spraying spot diameter) is established. This depends on a complex of factors that determine the intensity of heat removal from the area of layer formation. For optimizing the structure and the mechanical characteristics of the coating, we need to control decarbonization of carbide component (WC) and formation of alpha-Ni (W) solid solution at different stages of spraying. Even a minor departure from carbon content leads to either appearance of graphite or formation the fragile eta'-phase (Co3W3C), thus strongly reducing the mechanical properties.

J	Arenas, JG; Hendrick, P; Henneaux, P				Arenas, Julien Garcia; Hendrick, Patrick; Henneaux, Pierre			Optimisation of Integrated Systems: The Potential of Power and Residential Heat Sectors Coupling in Decarbonisation Strategies	ENERGIES			English	Article						multi-energy systems; linear programming; residential heat; sector coupling; long-term planning; energy supply	TECHNOLOGIES; GAS	According to the objectives of the Paris Agreement on climate change, the European energy supply must be fully decarbonised by 2050. For the power sector, a massive deployment of decentralised renewable technologies will be required to provide carbon-free electricity. However, other energy-intensive sectors such as gas, heat, transport, and the industrial sectors are more challenging to decarbonise, since they rely mostly on liquid and gaseous fuels. Consequently, exploiting the synergies between energy vectors in an integrated, multi-energy system represents an opportunity for a cost-effective transition towards a carbon-free economy. The objective of this study is to provide insights on the coupling of power and residential heat supply systems in a centralised multi-energy system by developing a linear program that optimises the interactions between energy carriers such as electricity, heat, hydrogen, biomass, and methane to minimise the long-term investments in generation and storage assets. The tool was then applied to a case study for a carbon-neutral energy supply in the Brussels-Capital Region in 2050, and conclusions were drawn on the potential of sector coupling to determine the optimal supply system configuration. The conclusions were that the central planning and operation of a coupled system could induce an annual cost reduction of ownership and operation of more than 23% compared to the individual management of the power and residential heat sectors. The cost reduction reaches 30.9% if one further considers centralised, district-level storage and distribution of heat in district heating systems. Finally, it was concluded that the intermittent renewable energy infeed required along biomass to meet the total energy demand is significantly reduced in the optimal scenario. Indeed, the installed capacities of PV and wind onshore can be respectively reduced by 31.9% and 55.8%.

The recent dynamic growth in offshore wind power together with the vast wind energy potential of the European seas, including the Baltic Sea, make this technology an increasingly attractive and viable option. Considering the high installation and connection costs, government support is considered essential for the development of offshore wind power. The aim of this article is to analyze Poland's public policy tools, which govern offshore wind farm development, and to present them from a wider geostrategic perspective. Authors identify, classify, and evaluate individual public policy tools with the use of multi-criteria and multi-dimensional methods while explaining their impact on offshore wind development in Poland. The analysis of the individual tools has shown that the currently applied tools give a high probability of achieving public policy objectives. The characteristics of the applied tools prove that vital decisions on offshore wind energy have been made concerning the need for decarbonization but also regarding wider geostrategic calculations. Given the changing security dynamics in the Baltic Sea region, we highlight potential geostrategic risks to the implementation of offshore wind projects.

J	Li, FGN; Trutnevyte, E				Li, Francis G. N.; Trutnevyte, Evelina			Investment appraisal of cost-optimal and near-optimal pathways for the UK electricity sector transition to 2050	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Uncertainty analysis; Energy transitions; Electricity; Investment appraisal; Modelling to generate alternatives; Decarbonization	100-PERCENT RENEWABLE ENERGY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SYSTEM; SCENARIOS; POLICY; FUTURE; POWER; UNCERTAINTIES; REDUCTION; MODEL	Deep decarbonisation of the electricity sector is central to achieving the United Kingdom's (UK) climate policy targets for 2050 and meeting its international commitments under the Paris Agreement. While the overall strategy for decarbonising the energy system has been well established in previous studies, there remain deep uncertainties around the total investment cost requirements for the power system. The future of the power system is of critical importance because low carbon electricity may create significant opportunities for emissions reduction in buildings and transport. A key policy application of quantitative analysis using models is to explore how much investment needs to be mobilised for the energy transition. However, past estimates of energy transition costs for the UK power sector have focused only on 2030 rather than 2050 and consider a relatively narrow range of uncertainties. This paper addresses this important research gap. The UK government's main whole system energy economy model is linked to a power system model that employs an advanced approach to uncertainty analysis, combining Monte Carlo simulation with Modelling-to-Generate Alternatives (MGA), producing 800 different scenario pathways. These pathways simultaneously consider uncertainties in policy, technology and costs. The results show that with No Climate Policy, installed generdtion capacities in 2050 are found in the range 60-75 GW, while under an 80% Reduction in GHG Emissions, between 100 GW and 130 GW of plant are required. Meeting climate targets for 2050 is also found to increase the investment requirements for new electricity generation. The interquartile range for cumulative investments in new generation under the No Climate Policy scenario ranges from 60bh pound to 75bn pound, while under an 80% Reduction in GHG Emissions, investment requirements approximately double to 110bn pound - 140bn pound. The exercise demonstrates the importance of uncertainty analysis to policy evaluation, yielding insights for future research practice both in the UK and internationally. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Results indicate that options focusing on incremental energy efficiency (e.g., combined heat and power) and yield improvements have a limited impact on GHG reductions. To achieve deep decarbonization (>50% GHG reduction compared to current corn ethanol production), a fuel switch from natural gas (NG) to alternative low-carbon fuels is needed. Replacing 50% of NG demand at ethanol plants with syngas from biomass through gasification or renewable natural gas from animal waste could achieve significant GHG reductions (11.7-23.5 g CO(2)e/MJ ethanol). Adding multiple technologies, including carbon capture and storage, to existing ethanol plants may further reduce GHG emissions to -18.4 g CO(2)e MJ(-1) ethanol (including land-use change emissions), which is 120% lower than the carbon intensity of pure gasoline. These results could inform how the ethanol industry could move toward net-zero ethanol production. (c) 2022 UChicago Argonne, LLC, Operation of Argonne National Laboratory.

J	Garha, NS; Mira, RG; Gonzalez-Laxe, F				Singh Garha, Nachatter; Garcia Mira, Ricardo; Gonzalez-Laxe, Fernando			Energy Transition Narratives in Spain: A Case Study of As Pontes	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						energy transition; carbon-intensive regions; narrative approach; stakeholder mapping; As Pontes	CLIMATE; FUKUSHIMA; GERMANY; POLICY	The energy transition is one of the most important processes of the last decade in Spain, affecting all aspects of life (social, political, economic and demographic). Its main objective is to eventually replace the fossil-fuel-based energy matrix with renewable energy sources to avoid climate change and meet sustainable development goals. This transition has affected a large number of population groups and institutions in carbon-intensive regions such as As Pontes, who are the main stakeholders in this process. These stakeholders have generated different narratives around the implementation of decarbonization policies and their short- and long-term impacts on the local population and the territory. These narratives affect the acceptance and pace of implementation of decarbonization measures and policies adopted by national and regional governments. Based on a qualitative analysis of published material (press articles, policy reports published by central and regional governments, reports published by environmental groups, financial institutions and large companies), this article first identifies the different stakeholders involved in the decarbonization process and maps them according to their power and interest in the energy transition process and then highlights the prevalent energy transition narratives, with their impact on the pace of the energy transition in Spain, focusing on the case of As Pontes. The results show that the narratives propagated by different stakeholders have a great impact on the acceptance of the decarbonization policies and measures adopted by the central government and the pace of the energy transition in different parts of Spain, including the region of As Pontes.

Smart local energy systems (SLES) have been touted as key for both a rapid scale-up of renewable elec-tricity and flexibility for stability in decarbonised electricity systems. A novel agent-based model - incorporating local investor and governance agents, improved temporal resolution, and demand-side flexibility - was used to investigate strategic decision making in the scale-up of SLES. From the perspective of this model, key modelling insights include: SLES investors, initially supported by local governments, can successfully boost the uptake of renewable energy up to 80% of total generation; SLES scale-up significantly erodes the market share and prof-itability of incumbent utilities, however national level agents are still key for capital-intensive low carbon plants; Demand-side response facilitates balancing electricity supply and demand, but it can result in non-optimal policy agents postponing required incentives for heterogeneous investor agents to build new low carbon plants; Na-tional carbon prices (in conjunction with local SLES and technology support mechanisms) are needed to maintain overall system stability. Therefore, understanding the critical role of non-optimal investor decision making is key to fully understand the drivers and implications of a rapid scale-up of SLES.

Asset Revaluation and the Existential Politics of Climate Change	INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION			English	Article						Asset revaluation; climate change; decarbonization; existential politics; liberal international order (LIO); trade	DOMESTIC POLITICS; PROTECTIONISM	Whereas scholars have typically modeled climate change as a global collective action challenge, we offer a dynamic theory of climate politics based on the present and future revaluation of assets. Climate politics can be understood as a contest between owners of assets that accelerate climate change, such as fossil fuel plants, and owners of assets vulnerable to climate change, such as coastal property. To date, obstruction by "climate-forcing" asset holders has been a large barrier to effective climate policy. But as climate change and decarbonization policies proceed, holders of both climate-forcing and "climate-vulnerable" assets stand to lose some or even all of their assets' value over time, and with them, the basis of their political power. This dynamic contest between opposing interests is likely to intensify in many sites of political contestation, from the subnational to transnational levels. As it does so, climate politics will become increasingly existential, potentially reshaping political alignments within and across countries. Such shifts may further undermine the Liberal International Order (LIO); as countries develop pro-climate policies at different speeds and magnitudes, they will have incentives to diverge from existing arrangements over trade and economic integration.

J	Parsons, RV				Parsons, Robert, V			Canada as a Case Study for Balanced Presentation to Address Controversy on Emission Reduction Policies	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						balanced presentation; emission reduction; carbon tax; cap and trade; carbon pricing; renewable fuel; energy efficiency; vehicle electrification; electricity decarbonization; grid intensity	CARBON TAX; ELASTICITY; GASOLINE; SHIFT	Controversy is common on environmental issues, with carbon taxation in Canada a current example. This paper uses Canada as a case study for analysis based around balanced presentation, a technique developed some time ago, yet largely forgotten. Using the method, analysis is shifted away from the point of controversy to a broader quantitative question, with comparative data employed from official government sources. Simple quantitative analysis is applied to evaluate emission trends of individual Canadian provinces, with quantitative metrics to identify and confirm the application of relevant emission reduction policies by individual jurisdictions. From 2005 through 2019, three provinces show consistent downward emission trends, two show consistent upward trends, and the remaining five have no trends, showing relatively "flat" profiles. The results clarify, in terms of diverse emission reduction policies, where successes have occurred, and where deficiencies or ambiguities have existed. Neither carbon taxation nor related cap-and-trade show any association with long-term reductions in overall emissions. One policy does stand out as being associated with long-term reductions, namely grid decarbonization. The results suggest a possible need within Canada to rethink emission reduction policies. The method may be relevant as a model for other countries to consider as well.

J	Hayashi, D				Hayashi, Daisuke			Harnessing innovation policy for industrial decarbonization: Capabilities and manufacturing in the wind and solar power sectors of China and India	ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Innovation; Technological characteristics; Wind Power; Solar photovoltaic; China; India	TECHNOLOGY-TRANSFER; DEMAND-PULL; SYSTEMS; LOCALIZATION; TRANSITION; KNOWLEDGE; DYNAMICS; PUSH	This study examines how technological characteristics influence the impacts of policy on innovation with respect to wind turbine and solar photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing industries in China and India. The analysis draws on patent applications and government policies in the aforementioned industries from 2000-2017. Wind power and solar PV patents in China have increased rapidly since the mid-2000s, whereas patent numbers in India have remained low. Between 2000-2017, wind turbine was a design-intensive and cost-competitive technology. Consequently, building innovation capabilities in the wind turbine industry required technology-push policies to support research and development and tacit knowledge transfer, and demand-pull policies to create a sizeable, predictable, and performance-oriented domestic market. Solar PV was considered to be a manufacturing -intensive and more expensive technology. Thus, the PV manufacturing industry benefited from technology-push policies that promoted export-oriented manufacturing. While the domestic market played a supplementary role, demand-pull policies that focused on guaranteed investment returns (feed-in tariffs) helped to improve the innovation performance in solar PV. China balanced the implementation of technology-push and demand-pull policies that met these technology-specific requirements. On the contrary, India's inadequate technology-push policies led to a lag in innovation in wind power and solar PV. Thus, policymakers need to strike a balance between technology-push and demand-pull policies, particularly by integrating innovation policies into a policy mix, and focus on technological characteristics as they determine the nature of the technological learning required to develop innovation capabilities.

J	Zimakov, AV				Zimakov, A., V			French Energy Sector in Search for Optimal Model	MGIMO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS			Russian	Article						France; EU; EU energy market; energy in France; nuclear phase out; nuclear power plant; nuclear energy; clean energy transition; decarbonization; renewables	NUCLEAR-POWER; PROSPECTS; FUTURE; FRANCE	Clean energy transition is one of major transformation processes in the EU. There are different approaches among EU countries to decarbonization of their energy systems. The article deals with clean energy transition in France with the emphasis on power generation. While this transformation process is in line with similar developments in the EU, the Franch case has its distinct nature due to nuclear power domination in electricity production there. It represents a challenge for the current model as the transition is linked to a sharp drop of nuclear share in the power mix. It is important to understand the trajectory of further clean energy transition in France and its ultimate model. The article reviews the historical roots of the current model (which stems from Messmer plan of the 1970-es) and its development over years, as well as assesses its drawbacks and merits in order to outline possible future prospects. The conclusion is that the desired reduction of nuclear energy is linked not solely to greening process but has a complex of reasons, the ageing of nuclear reactors being one of them. Nuclear power remains an important low-carbon technology allowing France to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. A desired future energy model in France can be understood based on the analysis of new legislation and government action plans. The targeted model is expected to balance of nuclear and green energy in the generation mix in 50% to 40% proportion by 2035, with the rest left to gas power generation. Being pragmatic, French government aims at partial nuclear reactors shut down provided that this will not lead to the rise of GHG emissions, energy market distortions, or electricity price hikes. The balanced French model is believed to be a softer and socially comfortable option of low-carbon model.

The regional dimensions of the 'transition to a low-carbon economy': the case of Australia's Latrobe Valley, Regional Studies. Translating concern about climate change into practical, effective and politically feasible policy action is a key challenge for contemporary governments. In Australia, the government's failure to launch 'the transition to a low-carbon economy' is reshaping the political landscape. This article argues that progress has stalled because politicians emboldened by the moral challenge of climate action, but schooled in market-based policy solutions, have not acknowledged or made provision for the regional impacts of the economic transformation they propose.

J	Horan, D				Horan, David			A New Approach to Partnerships for SDG Transformations	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						sustainable development; SDG transformations; means of implementation; partnerships; governance; governments	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS; ENERGY JUSTICE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MULTISTAKEHOLDER PARTNERSHIPS; INITIATIVES; TRANSITIONS; GOVERNANCE; SCIENCE	Recent scientific reports highlight the urgent need for transformations to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and long-term sustainability. This paper presents a new approach to partnerships that focuses on their role in transformations, the types of partnerships that may be needed and their enabling environment. It introduces transformation effectiveness as a criterion to evaluate a portfolio of partnerships and pathways as a tool to frame discussion of required partnerships. Guided by energy decarbonization and using a simple model of partnership formation, I highlight a (potential) mismatch between the types of partnerships required for transformation and the partnership types arising under the currently dominant voluntary approach. The model suggests the bottom-up approach can deliver some, but not all, of the partnerships needed. Five specific problems are identified-compensation for losers, partnering capacity, short-time horizons, inadequate coordination mechanisms and misaligned incentives. The paper then outlines some policy tools-transfers, regulation, public investment-governments could use to strengthen the bottom-up framework and orchestrate missing partnerships. The conclusion addresses two problems specific to the transformation approach: how to identify more systematically the partnerships needed (identification problem) and how to implement them (implementation problem); and outlines some ways to deal with these-science, deliberation, international leadership coalitions and frameworks/monitoring systems for transition partnerships.

Insights from four European countries	ENERGY SOURCES PART B-ECONOMICS PLANNING AND POLICY			English	Article						Political ideology; climate policy; energy policy; europe; european Union; renewable energy; flexibility	TRANSITION PATHWAYS; ELECTRICITY SYSTEM; POWER-SYSTEM; SCALE; COSTS	We investigate whether political ideology has an observable effect on decarbonization ambition, renewable power aims, and preferences for power system balancing technologies in four European countries. Based on the Energy Logics framework, we identify ideologically different transition strategies (state-centered, market-centered, grassroots-centered) contained in government policies and opposition party programs valid in 2019. We compare these policies and programs with citizen poll data. We find that ideology has a small effect: governments and political parties across the spectrum have similar, and relatively ambitious, decarbonization and renewables targets. This mirrors citizens' strong support for ambitious action regardless of their ideological self-description. However, whereas political positions on phasing out fossil fuel power are clear across the policy space, positions on phasing in new flexibility options to balance intermittent renewables are vague or non-existent. As parties and citizens agree on strong climate and renewable power aims, the policy ambition is likely to remain high, even if governments change.

The analysis takes into account national end-use data from the residential and tertiary sector that had not been exploited up to now. Four final energy demand scenarios with diverging assumptions were defined in this study, offering a wide range of possible outcomes up to 2040; in addition, four alternative scenarios were applied for sensitivity analysis. Two of these scenarios can be regarded as those continuing the trends of the recent past in Cyprus (prior to the economic and financial downturn of years 2011-2014). However, a more rigorous implementation of energy efficiency measures in buildings and transport, as defined in the fourth scenario of this study, is also realistic; despite its potential costs, it might allow Cyprus both to decrease its carbon emissions in line with the long-term EU decarbonisation targets, and to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels, thereby promoting energy efficiency as an important climate change adaptation measure.

Transforming Built Environments: Towards Carbon Neutral and Blue-Green Cities	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						decarbonisation; water sensitive cities; sustainable urban development; liveable cities; climate change; urban transitions	URBAN WATER MANAGEMENT; THERMAL COMFORT; TRANSITIONS; MELBOURNE; SUSTAINABILITY; LESSONS; CLIMATE; SECTOR; CONSUMPTION; INNOVATION	In the 21st century, the creation of built environments that are carbon neutral and water sensitive is critical for addressing sustainable urban development challenges. Both require transformative change: Decarbonisation to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and incorporation of green-blue water sensitive solutions to adapt to climate change impacts. Transition pathways in both arenas involve combinations of new technology, innovative urban design, enabling policies and regulations, new processes for planning and managing urban development, and demand-side changes in consumer attitudes and practices for urban living related to energy and water use. In this paper, we present new knowledge, concepts and frameworks developed for application in Australia, as well as internationally, through research by the national Cooperative Research Centres for Low Carbon Living (CRCLCL) and Water Sensitive Cities (CRCWSC) between 2012 and 2020. These findings and outputs illustrate common features of the research strategies and initiatives that were central to the activities of the CRCs, and highlight promising directions for collaborative interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research that drives urban sustainability transformations towards carbon neutral and blue-green cities.

APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Energy modelling; Climate policy; Energy policy; Decarbonisation; Energy data; Big data	SMART METER DATA; BOTTOM-UP; TOP-DOWN; SYSTEMS; CLIMATE; POLICY; UNCERTAINTY; EFFICIENCY; MOBILITY; BEHAVIOR	Energy economy models are central to decision making on energy and climate issues in the 21st century, such as informing the design of deep decarbonisation strategies under the Paris Agreement. Designing policies that are aimed at achieving such radical transitions in the energy system will require ever more in-depth modelling of end-use demand, efficiency and fuel switching, as well as an increasing need for regional, sectoral, and agent disaggregation to capture technological, jurisdictional and policy detail. Building and using these models entails complex trade-offs between the level of detail, the size of the system boundary, and the available computing resources. The availability of data to characterise key energy system sectors and interactions is also a key driver of model structure and parameterisation, and there are many blind spots and design compromises that are caused by data scarcity. We may soon, however, live in a world of data abundance, potentially enabling previously impossible levels of resolution and coverage in energy economy models. But while big data concepts and platforms have already begun to be used in a number of selected energy research applications, their potential to improve or even completely revolutionise energy economy modelling has been almost completely overlooked in the existing literature. In this paper, we explore the challenges and possibilities of this emerging frontier. We identify critical gaps and opportunities for the field, as well as developing foundational concepts for guiding the future application of big data to energy economy modelling, with reference to the existing literature on decision making under uncertainty, scenario analysis and the philosophy of science.

Critical to this will be an understanding of the composition and characteristics of the industrial clusters and of the costs for the CCTS systems. However, the available literature presents a wide range of cost values and many of the studies do not tend to consider all of the carbon transport and storage elements together. Moreover, there are a very limited number of UK specific analyses and in some cases the studies are considered to be too historical. In this paper, we present a review and characterisation of the main UK industrial clusters, in terms of geographical limits, available infrastructure, industries present and level of emissions. We then provide a brief review of carbon transport and storage (T&S) cost models and costing information before conducting a technoeconomic assessment of the potential T&S system costs for the UK industrial clusters. To the best of our knowledge, this integrated analysis has not been conducted for the UK context, and this is key for policy development and to assess the wider economic impacts of CCTS. From our cluster characterisation and techno-economic analysis, we found that there is important potential for CCTS for industrial decarbonisation in the UK. Also, the creation of a CO2 shipping industry will allow for industrial clusters that do not have an adequate storage sites nearby to use the CCTS infrastructure in other sites. The development of a CO2 shipping infrastructure also enables carbon management and storage services to be exported to polluters overseas, potentially creating and maintaining jobs and economic growth. We believe that the cluster characterisation and cost estimates produced here provide valuable insight to inform policy and can be used as a first step for to develop further analysis in policy relevant areas such as an analysis of the wider economic impacts of these investments, the effect on jobs and competitiveness and the impact on the wider society.

J	Evans, B; Sidat, S				Evans, Barny; Sidat, Sabbir			The use of temporal factors for improved CO2 emissions accounting in buildings	BUILDING SERVICES ENGINEERING RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Joint Technical Symposium of Chartered-Institution-of-Building-Services-Engineers (CIBSE) / ASHARE - Delivering Resilient High Performance Buildings	APR 05-06, 2017	Leicestershire, ENGLAND	Chartered Inst Build Serv Engineers, ASHARE		Carbon accounting; CO2; decarbonisation; electricity; emissions; renewable energy; energy efficiency		This paper is an investigation into the issues around how we calculate CO2 emissions in the built environment. At present, in Building Regulations and GHG Protocol calculations used for buildings and corporate CO2 emissions calculations, it is standard to use a single number for the CO2 emission factor of each source. This paper considers how energy demand, particularly electricity at different times of the day, season and even year can differ in terms of its CO2 emissions. This paper models three different building types (retail, office and home) using standard software to estimate a profile of energy demand. It then considers how CO2 emissions calculations differ between using the single standard emissions factor and using an hourly emissions factor based on real electrical grid generation over a year. The paper also examines the impact of considering lifetime emissions factors rather than one-year factors using UK government projections. The results show that there is a significant difference to the analysis of benefit in terms of CO2 emissions from different measures - both intra- and inter-year - due to the varying CO2 emissions intensity, even when they deliver the same amount of net energy saving. Other factors not considered in this paper, such as impact on peak generation and air quality, are likely to be important when considering whole-system impacts. In line with this, it is recommended that moves are made to incorporate intra- and inter-year emissions factor changes in methodologies for calculating CO2 emissions. (This is particularly important as demand side response and energy storage, although generally accepted as important in the decarbonisation of the energy system at present will show as an increase in CO2 emissions when using a single number.) Further work quantifying the impact on air quality and peak generation capacity should also be considered. Practical application: This paper aims to help practitioners to understand the performance gap between how systems need to be designed in order to meet regulations compared to how buildings perform in reality - both today and in the future. In particular, it considers the use of real-time' carbon factors in order to attain long-term CO2 reductions. This methodology enables decision makers to understand the impacts of different energy reduction technologies, considering each of their unique characteristics and usage profiles. If implemented, the result is a simple-to-use dataset which can be embedded into the software packages already available onto the market which mirrors the complexity of the electricity grid that is under-represented through the use of a static carbon figure.

J	Mildenberger, M; Howe, PD; Trachtman, S; Stokes, LC; Lubell, M				Mildenberger, Matto; Howe, Peter D.; Trachtman, Samuel; Stokes, Leah C.; Lubell, Mark			The effect of public safety power shut-offs on climate change attitudes and behavioural intentions	NATURE ENERGY			English	Article							LOCAL WEATHER; PERCEPTIONS; EXPERIENCE; RESISTANCE	Climate change adaptation policies could influence public decarbonization behaviours positively or negatively, impacting further mitigation and adaptation efforts. This study examines public responses to planned power outages in California and finds that the outages shaped some energy behavioural intentions but did not alter climate or energy policy preferences. As climate change accelerates, governments will be forced to adapt to its impacts. The public could respond by increasing mitigation behaviours and support for decarbonization, creating a virtuous cycle between adaptation and mitigation. Alternatively, adaptation could generate backlash, undermining mitigation behaviours. Here we examine the relationship between adaptation and mitigation in the power sector, using the case of California's public safety power shut-offs in 2019. We use a geographically targeted survey to compare residents living within power outage zones to matched residents in similar neighbourhoods who retained their electricity. Outage exposure increased respondent intentions to purchase fossil fuel generators while it may have reduced intentions to purchase electric vehicles. However, exposure did not change climate policy preferences, including willingness to pay for either wildfire or climate-mitigating reforms. Respondents blamed outages on their utility, not local, state or federal governments. Our findings demonstrate that energy infrastructure disruptions, even when not understood as climate adaptations, can still be consequential for decarbonization trajectories.

Carbon intensities in the power grid are time-varying and can fluctuate significantly within hours, so shifting building loads in response to the carbon intensities can reduce a building's operational carbon emissions. This paper presents a rule-based carbon responsive control framework that controls the setpoints of thermostatically controlled loads responding to the grid's carbon emission signals in real time. Based on this framework, four controllers are proposed with different combinations of carbon accounting methods and control rules. To evaluate their performance, we performed simulation studies using models of a 27-home, all-electric, net zero energy residential community located in Basalt, Colorado, United States. The carbon intensity data of four future years from the Cambium data set are adopted to account for the evolving resource mix in the power grid. Various performance metrics, including energy consumption, carbon emission, energy cost, and thermal discomfort, were used to evaluate the performance of the controllers. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted to determine how the control thresholds and intervals affect the controllers' performance. Simulation results indicate that the carbon responsive controllers can reduce the homes' annual carbon emissions by 6.0% to 20.5%. However, the energy consumption increased by 0.9% to 6.7%, except in one scenario where it decreased by 2.2%. Compared to the baseline, the change in energy cost was between -2.9% and 3.4%, and thermal discomfort was also maintained within an acceptable range. The little impact on energy cost and thermal discomfort indicates there are no potential roadblocks for customer acceptance when rolling out the controllers in utility programs.

This reflects evidence that the costs and benefits of low carbon restructuring will not be distributed evenly or fairly between people and places. Some households and localities will benefit from decarbonization but others will be disproportionately affected by rising energy costs and job loss. In this paper we use the example of England to explore different dimensions of advantage and disadvantage in low carbon restructuring and how they might be reinforced or mediated by intervention by governments, NGOs and citizens. The paper makes a distinctive contribution by linking different sites and policy areas in the distributional politics of decarbonization from the perspective of individuals and households. Emphasis is placed on understanding just energy-carbon transitions from a households-in-place perspective. The analytical framework is exemplified through case studies of the coming to ground of different strands of energy-carbon restructuring in England.

However, environmental and climate justice groups warn that natural gas will lock in high carbon pathways, in addition to creating significant environmental harms and health risks for affected communities. This contestation around the framing of natural gas reflects a process of interpretive politics, namely the struggle of different actors to define policy problems and present potential solutions to influence policy outcomes. We explore the interpretive politics of natural gas in Canada by analyzing government climate plans and press releases produced by industry associations and other relevant, primarily non-governmental, organizations in the post-Paris era. We identify three distinct variations of the bridge fuel narrative around the purported clean energy benefits of natural gas driven by industry associations and provincial governments. Though the language of clean energy benefits is spreading, the meaning varies significantly by regional context. The malleable position of natural gas as a source of interpretive contestation has important implications for future coalition-building and decarbonization.

Julio			Low-carbon production of iron and steel: Technology options, economic assessment, and policy	JOULE			English	Review							BLAST-FURNACE; BIOMASS; IRONMAKING; REDUCTION; INJECTION; CAPTURE; STEELMAKING; BEHAVIOR; STORAGE; GAS	A SUMMARY Given increased urgency to transition the global economy to net-zero CO2 emission, governments and industry have increased focus on decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors, including steel making, which contributes roughly 6% of global CO2 emission and 8% of energy-related emission (including power consumption emission). This paper reviews current global iron and steel production and assesses available decarbonization technologies, including hydrogen injection, solid biomass substitution, zero-C electricity substitution, carbon capture and storage (CCS) retrofit, and combinations of these decarbonization approaches. Blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) dominates production (71%) and is particularly stubborn to any decarbonization technology. Direct reduced iron to electric arc furnace (DRI-EAF) production is 5% and growing, it appears to have better decarbonization potential to move toward net-zero. Secondary steel production using mainly steel scrap in electric arc furnace (EAF-scrap) is 24% of global production and has both the lowest energy consumption and is technically simplest to decarbonize through electrification but is limited in market share to recycled steel capacity. Of the options assessed, blue hydrogen, carbon neutral biomass, and CCS appear to have the lowest cost and highest technical maturity. However, no single approach today can deliver deep decarbonization to the iron and steel industry and all approaches lead to substantial production cost increase. No uniform ideal solution exists, and different geographies, infrastructure, and economies will determine the local optimum solution with viability and cost. Policy measures will be required to provide financial incentives for decarbonization and to avoid unwelcome outcomes such as emissions leakage or job loss.	[Fan, Zhiyuan; Friedmann, S.

ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER			English	Article								We summarize the findings of a new MIT study on the future of nuclear energy. The context for the study is the challenge of simultaneously expanding energy access and economic opportunity to billions of people while drastically reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. We find that while decarbonization of the electricity sector can be accomplished employing an assortment of low-carbon technologies in various combinations, nuclear has a uniquely valuable role to play as a dispatchable low-carbon technology, Excluding a dispatchable low-carbon option like nuclear, as the German Energiewende does, significantly increases the cost and difficulty of achieving decarbonization targets. We also find that the high cost of new nuclear plants limits nuclear's role in a balanced portfolio. Reducing this cost can significantly reduce the total cost of decarbonization. Our study identified the factors driving up cost, and we identify promising approaches to achieving cost reductions. Finally, we identify needed government policies. These include decarbonization strategies that recognize the contribution of all low carbon energy technologies and treat them equally in the electricity market. These also include policies to accommodate and support development and demonstration of advanced reactor designs.

Words like "transport system decarbonization", "electromobility", and "environmental-friendly society" are very popular today, but questions remain as to how to measure electric vehicles' adoption progress and how this transition changes the battery industry. This perspective paper provides a review of the electric cars and buses market, estimates the production volumes of some other electric vehicle types, and discusses the role of traction batteries in the global battery market. A simple estimation of the sales rate allows us to evaluate the prospects of electric vehicle adoption in leading countries. Finally, the application of the main battery chemistries is reviewed and topical issues to the research society are addressed and formulated.

J	Liu, XH; Qian, C; Wang, SH				Liu, Xiaohong; Qian, Cheng; Wang, Shenghui			When do 3PLs initiate low-carbon supply chain integration?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						3PLs; Low-carbon supply chain integration; Supply chain management; Social network perspective	ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY; RELATIONAL EMBEDDEDNESS; INSTITUTIONAL PRESSURES; INFORMATION INTEGRATION; STRUCTURAL EMBEDDEDNESS; MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES; SERVICE INDUSTRY; GREEN PRACTICES; LOGISTICS; NETWORK	Purpose This paper draws on the perspective of social networks to examine when 3PLs initiate low-carbon supply chain integration (LCSCI) in decarbonising supply chains. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey was conducted on a sample of 348 Chinese 3PLs. Stepwise regression was adopted to analyse the data. Findings It is found that LCSCI has a positive effect on firm performance. From the social network perspective, a larger scope of outsourcing increases 3PLs' embeddedness, which increases their chance of success in initiating LCSCI, especially for 3PLs with higher decarbonisation capabilities. Interestingly, although the pressure from government regulation can also motivate LCSCI, it is less effective for 3PLs with higher decarbonisation capabilities because they can be too embedded in the network to freely adapt to regulations. Research limitations/implications This study has investigated 3PL-initiated LCSCI only from the view of 3PLs. A dyadic approach which includes the perception of customers would be desirable. Practical implications The results highlight the critical role of 3PLs as supply chain orchestrators in decarbonising supply chains, and the effectiveness of LCSCI as a competitive strategy of 3PLs.

J	Wozniak, J; Krysa, Z; Dudek, M				Wozniak, Justyna; Krysa, Zbigniew; Dudek, Michal			Concept of government-subsidized energy prices for a group of individual consumers in Poland as a means to reduce smog	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Energy price; Smog; Low emission; AQAPs; Air quality action plans	AIR-QUALITY; PM2.5	Integration of conventional energy production with the Polish mining industry is a complex task in the light of decarbonisation guidelines and the development of Renewable Energy Sources. Smog as a seasonal phenomenon requires differentiation between the use of coal as fuel in conventional power plants and combined heat and power plants, and the burning of coal in the municipal and individual household sector. Domestic coal is a strategic fuel in energy and heat generation. The household sector, being the main cause of smog, is the sector that most needs to be changed. The main goal of the paper is to analyse the transition from fossil fuel combustion in households to electric heating, taking into account boiler efficiency and the current market prices of both coal and electric energy. Based on the performed calculations, we propose providing consumers with regular support in the form of electricity price subsidies (as a subsidy to the spread between the price of electricity and coal) when they decide to abandon coal and switch to electric (or district) heating, thus reducing smog. The simulation results may help in deciding on the subsidy level for both energy costs and total costs.

Later, a second hydrogen wave due to another crisis occurred. Currently, the world is discussing the third hydrogen wave, for which, unlike the other two waves, its driving force is not the lack of fossil fuels but the imminent climate change. The hydrogen economy is expected to answer the energy storage challenges created by fluctuating electricity generation from renewable energy sources and provide a solution for the decarbonization of high energy demand sectors and the synthesis of many chemicals. Today, governments around the globe are committed to scale-up the hydrogen economy; more than 30 nations have launched a National Hydrogen Plan or Strategy. The hydrogen economy functions with a Power-to-X (PtX) versatile system. Power-to-X ("X" as an energy carrier) refers to hydrogen produced via a carbon-free process and the further storage of this element either as pure hydrogen or converted to an energy carrier that can easily be stored, transported, and used, such as ammonia, methanol and other liquid organic hydrogen carriers. This paper conducts a literature review of the political commitment regarding the hydrogen economy, the status of PtX technologies, and development worldwide. It also compares four different scenarios for green hydrogen storage using various criteria. Power-to-Ammonia, Power-to-Methanol, Power-to-Hydrogen blended with natural gas, and Power-to-Liquid hydrogen are evaluated. Conclusively, the four concepts have their advantages and disadvantages, depending on the specific application and related scenario. Germany sponsors most of the research associated with PtX and is the country with the most advanced PtX projects. Therefore, Germany was chosen as a study case for multicriteria evaluation of PtX technologies. Power-to-Ammonia appears to be the best solution.

J	Ghenai, C; Bettayeb, M				Ghenai, Chaouki; Bettayeb, Maamar			Data analysis of the electricity generation mix for clean energy transition during COVID-19 lockdowns	ENERGY SOURCES PART A-RECOVERY UTILIZATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS			English	Article; Early Access						COVID-19; 3Ds Energy Transition; decarbonization; digitalization; decentralization; greenhouse Gas Emissions; electricity Generation Mix		This paper presents data analysis on the electricity generation mix during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. The main objective was to assess the percentage changes in energy supply (total energy generation, electricity generation from fossil fuels - coal and natural gas; renewables - solar PV, wind, Biomass, Hydro; and nuclear), energy demand (actual loads), and greenhouse gas emissions (CO2 emissions) during the COVID-19 lockdown and their impact on energy transition. The goal is to use energy data and facts during the COVID-19 pandemic to show the importance and the role of the development of clean energy systems in speeding up and fostering energy transition ((Decarbonization, Digitalization, and Decentralization). The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global health and economic crisis. Energy industry and energy transition play an important role in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis and during economic recovery. The introduction starts with some facts on the energy and CO2 emissions during the COVID-19 lockdowns. A statistical analysis is used in this study to assess the electricity generation mix during COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. The data clearly shows a decline of both energy consumption (up to 10%) and greenhouse gas emissions (up to 20%). Electricity generation from renewables was the highest compared to fossil fuels (coal and natural gas) and nuclear fuel during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns for the European Countries. Electricity generation from coal, natural gas and nuclear plants decreased by up to 35, 25, and 20% and the share of renewable increased by up to 9%.during COVID-19 lockdowns compared to 2019. The results obtained in the course of this study visibly show the importance of the development of clean energy systems for energy transition and how crucial these clean energy technologies are crucial during a global health and economic crisis. A triple helix model (collaboration between the government, industry and academia) for innovation is needed in this pandemic crisis to overcome the challenges and to shape the future of the energy sector. The new opportunities and challenges for the energy transition due to impacts of COVID-19 are presented in detail in this paper. The post-COVID-19 energy sector should be different from the conventional centralized and fossil fuel-based systems. The future energy systems will be cleaner, sustainable, intelligent, self-reliant, reliable, flexible, and affordable.

J	Jin, U; Kim, KT				Jin, Ukhwa; Kim, Kyu Tae			Experimental investigation of combustion dynamics and NOx/CO emissions from densely distributed lean-premixed multinozzle CH4/C3H8/H-2/air flames	COMBUSTION AND FLAME			English	Article						Combustion dynamics; Decarbonization; Gas turbine combustion; Fuel-flexible; Hydrogen; Lewis number; Multinozzle array	HYDROGEN ENRICHMENT; INSTABILITIES; MECHANISMS; TECHNOLOGY; SIMULATION; INJECTOR; IMPACT	Lean-premixed fuel-flexible combustion technology capable of operating on a wide range of fuels, including high or pure hydrogen, is expected to play a crucial role in reducing nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide emissions from heavy-duty gas turbine engines, ultimately in achieving energy system decarbonization. However, fuel-flexible operations, particularly with high hydrogen content fuels, require a fundamental, drastic change from conventional nozzle architecture. The use of a number of small-scale multitube injectors - also referred to as micromix nozzles - is indispensable to reduce the likelihood of flashback events in ultra-fast premixed hydrogen flames. At present, the vast majority of what is known about the fundamental mechanisms of combustion dynamics and emissions stem from intensive research in large-scale swirl-stabilized flames. The behavior of small-scale multinozzle flames governed by isolated or collective movements of constituent flames remains, however, largely unexplored. To address these questions, we use densely distributed sixty-injector mesoscale flames as a platform to explore the influence of a full range of CH4/C3H8/H-2 fuel blends - including all possible combinations of a blend of two different fuels (CH4 + C3H8, CH4 + H-2, C3H8 + H-2) and three different fuels (CH4 + C3H8 + H-2), as well as single-component fuels (CH4, C3H8, H-2) - on combustion dynamics and exhaust emissions under a constant adiabatic flame temperature condition. Here, we show that while the nitrogen oxide emissions are almost unaffected by the fuel compositions considered here, the variation of fuel composition has a significant impact on self-excited instabilities, which tend toward higher frequency oscillations with increasing hydrogen concentration. From phase-resolved OH PLIF measurements for a 50/50 mixture of CH4 and H-2, we identify the creation, evolution, and annihilation of an array of coherent vortical structures as the mechanism responsible for sound generation and flame surface modulations without strong interactions between adjacent flames. In contrast, the behavior of the 50% C3H8 + 50% H-2 case is dictated primarily by periodic merging and separation of neighboring reactant jets, leading to large-scale asymmetric oscillations in the transverse direction. Given the substantial change in transport properties, effective Lewis number-related interpretation provides a reasonable explanation for the different behaviors of a cluster of small-scale flames.

Despite the growing amount of data quantifying raw materials for energy production technologies, few examples of these data sources are being included in current energy system models. Accordingly, this paper introduces possible pathways for integrating material-specific life cycle assessment outputs and material metabolism indicators into energy system models so that raw material requirements, and their associated impacts, can be accounted for. The paper discusses the availability of life cycle inventories, impact assessment methods and important output indicators. The material metabolism indicators most relevant to the current policy debate surrounding the European Green Deal-namely, material supply risk and contribution of recycled materials to total supply-are also discussed alongside the value of adding this information to energy system models. A methodology for using data from both approaches is offered and operationalised using four sub-technologies of both wind turbines and solar photovoltaic panels as case studies. The results show that considerable variation exists between and within the two groups for all indicators. The technologies with the lowest global warming potential, cumulative energy demand and supply risk are turbines with gearbox double fed induction generators and cadmium telluride photovoltaics. Furthermore, wind turbines exhibit significantly higher recycling rates than photovoltaics. Ultimately, the integration of such methodologies into energy system models could greatly increase the awareness of raw material issues and guide policies that maximise compatibilities between resource availability and cleaner energy systems.

J	Cauvain, J; Karvonen, A; Petrova, S				Cauvain, Jenni; Karvonen, Andrew; Petrova, Saska			Market-based low-carbon retrofit in social housing: Insights from Greater Manchester	JOURNAL OF URBAN AFFAIRS			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; NORTHERN POWERHOUSE; ENERGY EFFICIENCY; LOCAL-GOVERNMENT; UK; URBAN; GOVERNANCE; CITY; POLITICS; SUSTAINABILITY	In recent years, social housing providers in the UK have become influential actors in realizing the national government's decarborization agenda. However, when decarbonization is considered in light of austerity measures and the privatization of public housing, a number of contradictions arise. From interviews and a workshop with policymakers and registered providers in the city-region of Greater Manchester, three tensions are highlighted. First, since the 1980s, the housing stock condition has been used as a political pawn in successive reforms to demunicipalize social housing. Second, local authorities continue to harness the collectivities that remain in the social housing sector to realize their decarbonization goals. Third, the retrofit practices of social landlords are only superficially aiming for carbon control; instead, they focus on the social aims that are seen as important to the ethos and business model of the landlord. The article concludes that there are unavoidable conflicts between the interests of different actors whose low-carbon economy is conceived at different spatial scales and with different underlying objectives. As social landlords are foregrounded in subregional low-carbon policy, they are effectively co-opted into market-based retrofit, resulting in unintended consequences for the social housing sector.

J	Somerville, P				Somerville, Peter			The continuing failure of UK climate change mitigation policy	CRITICAL SOCIAL POLICY			English	Article						decarbonisation; global emergency; new green deal	ENERGY; HEAT	Failure to take climate change seriously enough has resulted in the world now facing a climate emergency, with rising global temperatures, melting polar ice caps, increasingly frequent and severe storms, floods and droughts, and rising sea levels. Despite being the first country in the world to set statutory carbon emissions reduction targets (in the Climate Change Act 2008), the UK government since 2012 has fallen increasingly behind, even by its own standards. This paper details what this has meant in terms of specific policies and identifies some of the reasons for this policy failure: in particular, a negative attitude towards regulation and a return to a reliance on market forces, plus an overriding concern to continue with 'business as usual', in terms of support for fossil-fuel industries and ever-increasing energy demand and supply. Ironically, this has resulted in a situation where radical solutions seem even more necessary and more urgent.

J	Yang, M; Cela, B; Yang, F				Yang, Ming; Cela, Blerta; Yang, Fan			Innovative energy policy to transform energy systems in Ukraine	MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE			English	Article						Energy independence policy; decarbonization technologies; Zero-carbon economy initiative		To enhance its national energy security, the government of Ukraine has adopted many energy polices since 1989. Unfortunately, most of these policies have proved to be unsuccessful. The country's energy supply is still highly dependent on fossil fuel imports. This paper provides a comprehensive review on Ukraine's challenges from economic, social, political, and environmental aspects that are related to energy and carbon emission policies. An empirical methodology is used to analyze the energy situation and project energy demand by 2050. A new roadmap of energy investments is made from 2035-2050 with an objective of decarbonizing the Ukrainian energy system by 2050. Such roadmap is in line with the global commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 45% over the next decade and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. This article recommends 12 polices for the government ranging from stopping subsidy to fossil energy to accounting environment costs in fossil energy consumption, levying taxes on polluters, privatizing government-owned companies to adapt the Euopean Union (EU) energy systems, and terminating gas import from Russia. If these proposed energy policies are successfully implemented, the Ukrainian fossil fuel-based energy system will be transformed to a highly efficient energy system with zero-carbon emissions by 2050.

Regulators at both the state and federal level are well advised to take steps to address current policy gaps, build frameworks that will enable a greater role for LDES to contribute to grid reliability and be fairly compensated for its grid services.. Decarbonization by definition is dependent on an increasing reliance on variable renewable energy, primarily wind and solar resources, that needs to be stored for longer durations to maintain electric grid reliability and provide operational flexibility to grid operators. However, despite the growing realization of the need for long-duration energy storage (LDES) technologies, a persistent gap of policy levers at the federal and state level creates a vacuum in terms of defining how and where LDES technologies can be utilized to support the electric grid, along with an inadequate regulatory framework wherein these resources will need to be valued and compensated for the services they can provide. This paper-which is primarily intended for US decision makers, but should be of value for all energy professionals and the general public-addresses policy gaps, needs, and opportunities for LDES that require urgent attention from US-based policymakers at the federal and state level. This paper also provides background information on how the US E&U industry is structured and regulated, along with perspectives on LDES technologies and applications, all of which have direct relevance to the paper's primary focus on the need for LDES policymaking.

Gevo, Inc. is designing a new biorefinery to produce net-zero-emission jet fuel and gasoline from corn feedstock by replacing conventional energy sources with renewable energy sources along with carbon capture and storage (CCS). In this study, we analyze the GHG reduction of the plant design for Gevo's Net-Zero 1 plant on a life-cycle basis. The life cycle GHG emissions [also called carbon intensity (CI)] of Gevo's facility base case are estimated at 70.4 gCO(2)e/MJ when using conventional energy sources. Using four deep-decarbonization strategies to be deployed in the plant, GHG emissions can be reduced by 3.7, 11.5, 24.8, and 34 gCO(2)e/MJ through renewable hydrogen, renewable electricity, renewable heat sources, and CCS, respectively. Furthermore, sustainable and precision farming practices with increased yield would reduce the CI value further, to -34.6 gCO(2)e/ MJ. Given its design capacity, the operation of the Net-Zero 1 plant will result in a GHG reduction of 514,000 metric tons per year compared to the reference petroleum jet fuel and gasoline, while generating 170 million liters of SAFs and renewable gasoline a year with a CI of -3.5 gCO(2)e/MJ.

Evaluating options for the future energy mix of Japan after the Fukushima nuclear crisis	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Energy plan; Decarbonisation; Sustainability criteria	ELECTRICITY-GENERATION; POWER; WIND	The Fukushima nuclear accident in March 2011 has increased social and political reluctance to embrace nuclear power in Japan (and elsewhere). The Japanese government has thus been considering four possible future energy mixes, including a nuclear-free pathway, and three others with 10%-35% nuclear supply coupled with a larger proportion of renewable energy and fossil fuels to replace nuclear. Here we use multi-criteria decision-making analysis (MCDMA) to assess the potential negative economic (levelised cost of electricity, and energy security), environmental (greenhouse-gas emissions, land transformation, water consumption, heated water discharge, air pollution, radioactive waste, and solid waste) and social (safety issues) impacts of the four proposed pathways to determine which scenario most holistically minimises adverse future outcomes. The nuclear-free pathway has the highest overall potential for adverse outcomes (score=2.49 out of 3), and the 35% nuclear power supply option yielding the lowest negative impact score (0.74) without weightings. Despite some sensitivity to the choice of criterion weights, our analyses demonstrate clearly that from an empirical perspective, a nuclear-free pathway for Japan is the worst option to pursue. We recommend that MCDMA methodology we used for Japan can be applied to other countries to evaluate future electricity generation scenarios. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, current electrical systems were not built to be clean or renewable, and their resilience will be tested in new ways in the face of changing demand and climate change. Clearly, as part of reducing fossil dependence, there will need to be major investments in upgrading electricity generation and delivery. But with change comes challenges. How are governments, investors, utilities, project developers and consumers dealing with the competing demands for best-in-class-technology, reducing carbon footprints while providing reliable service at reasonable rates, and what can consumers afford or be required to pay for?

Stranded assets arise due to uncertainty about the future timing of these two types of events and substantial intertemporal and intersectoral investment adjustment costs. Stranding of assets mostly affects the 20 biggest oil, gas, and coal companies who have been responsible for at least one-third of global warming since 1965, but it also affects carbon-intensive industries such as steel, aluminum, cement, plastics, and greenhouse horticulture. A disorderly transition to the carbon-free economy will lead to stranded assets and legal claims. Institutional investors should be aware of these financial risks. A broader definition of stranded assets also includes countries reliant on fossil fuel exports and workers with technologyspecific skills.

It follows consultation through scoping wave energy workshops held by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) in August 2019 and by Supergen Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) Hub in January 2020 and a series of structured interviews with academics, policy-makers, funding bodies and industry professionals. It is believed that the UK has excellent wave resources and advanced techniques that need to be rapidly developed to achieve the target of 22 GW of installed capacity by 2050 Greaves et al. (2020). The wave energy resources in the UK are reviewed, summarising wave energy hotspots for development and identifying openly accessible wave data. The progress and achievements of wave energy development in the UK are reviewed and described to underline the important roles that UK government and industry support have to play in securing a leading position in wave energy. The potential benefits of wave energy for the decarbonisation of UK industry (including utility scale and niche markets) to achieve Net Zero target by 2050 are presented, as well as the steps that need to be taken in the next 30 years to achieve its potential.

This article examines what scope there is for the market to drive the decarbonisation of China's electricity supply, when hitherto most emission reductions have been achieved through traditional regulation (eg emissions performance standards and the forced closure of inefficient installations). The importance of traditional regulation does not mean that the ETS will not contribute to the decarbonisation of China's energy supply, but the role of the ETS will be different from that in liberalised energy markets (eg the European Union) where the market is supposed to be the main driver of emission reductions. In China, the role of the ETS will be limited to help achieve the energy investment targets set under the government's central planning policy.

J	Jones, C; Peshev, V; Gilbert, P; Mander, S				Jones, Christopher; Peshev, Vladimir; Gilbert, Paul; Mander, Sarah			Battery storage for post-incentive PV uptake? A financial and life cycle carbon assessment of a non-domestic building	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Life cycle assessment; Financial analysis; PV; Battery storage; Organisational barriers	GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT; SYSTEMS	The rapid growth of photovoltaic (PV) installations in recent years has largely been driven by government incentive schemes that make PV an attractive option for building owners seeking to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and energy costs. As government incentives are reduced or withdrawn the incorporation of battery storage, to lower building electricity grid imports through increased on-site PV self-consumption, is an option to sustain rooftop PV uptake. This study combines a life cycle assessment approach and discounted cash flow analysis to assess the CO2 and financial impact of adding battery storage to a PV assemblage in the context of future incentive withdrawal, electricity system decarbonisation and changing technology costs. An example non-domestic building in the UK with a 20 kW mono-crystalline silicon PV and lithium-ion battery storage is modelled. With electricity grid decarbonisation in line with the Paris Climate Change Agreement, the PV and battery system here reduces the building's CO2 emissions by 17% (19tCO(2)) compared with the grid-only reference over a 30year lifetime. The analysis also highlights that adding battery storage does not necessarily increase CO2 savings achieved by PV alone for the building, if grid decarbonisation is considered. PV systems without batteries in the UK are however found to be viable in 2020 without government incentives. For system considered here the battery costs of <334 pound/kWh available capacity are needed in 2020 for batteries to positively affect the financial performance of PV. The study therefore concludes that UK battery costs have to continue to reduce rapidly, or additional revenue from providing electricity system services is needed to make batteries financially attractive in lower insolation areas like the UK. Policy to reduce electricity system CO2 through building integrated battery uptake requires better understanding of the net system CO2 impact in line with other changes in electricity generation and demand.

What preferences do a nationally representative sample of the public in these countries hold towards low-carbon options? It is imperative that climate policy researchers and practitioners grapple with the difficulty of decarbonizing heat, which remains the largest single end-use service worldwide and which accounts about half of total final energy consumption. Based on a comparative assessment of five representative national surveys in Germany (N = 2009), Italy (N = 2039), Spain (N = 2038), Sweden (N = 2023), and the United Kingdom (N = 2000), this study explores the demographics and geography of household heat decarbonisation in Europe. By analyzing our country level data as well as our combined sample of 10,109 respondents, it investigates how people conceive of the purposes of low-carbon heat, their preferences for particular forms of heat supply, and their (at times odd) practices of heat consumption and temperature settings. Grounded in its original data, the study organizes its findings inductively across the five themes of literacy (heating knowledge, awareness and control), sustainability (heating practices, dynamics and conflicts), temperature (heating satisfaction and preferences), desirability of change (low-carbon heating priorities, business models and trust), and culture (country and national variation). The study also explores intersections between these dimensions, using multivariate analysis, as well as how preferences differ according to varying types of actors as well as geography and space.

J	Hirvonen, J; Saari, A; Jokisalo, J; Kosonen, R				Hirvonen, Janne; Saari, Arto; Jokisalo, Juha; Kosonen, Risto			Socio-economic impacts of large-scale deep energy retrofits in Finnish apartment buildings	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article							HEAT-PUMP SYSTEM; RENOVATION MEASURES; EFFICIENCY; BENEFITS; COST; PERFORMANCE; PACKAGES; DEMAND	Energy use in buildings is a major source of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in Europe. Energy use is a major expense for building owners, but also a source of tax revenue for the government. Deep energy retrofitting of buildings can significantly reduce the energy consumption and CO2 emissions of buildings. However, the environmental benefits are linked to the CO2 emissions of the national energy grid. Deep retrofits have a significant cost and are not always cost-effective for building owners. On the other hand, they require a lot of investments and labor, which provides employment for citizens and tax revenue for governments. This study examines the environmental and economic impacts of large-scale deep energy retrofitting in the Finnish apartment building stock continuing until 2050. Low and high impact retrofit configurations were obtained from a previous study, which utilized simulation-based multi-objective optimization to find cost-effective solutions. Four archetypes of apartment buildings from time periods of different building codes were used to form the building stock. A building stock model based on Finnish statistics was used to estimate the future changes in the building stock. The study combines optimized energy retrofitting configurations and the building stock model to estimate the energy consumption development in the building stock undergoing large-scale retrofitting. Three retrofitting timelines were tested to show the effect of immediate and delayed retrofitting action. Then, a new socioeconomic model was used to calculate the impact of energy retrofitting on the CO2 emissions, life cycle cost, tax revenue, employment and foreign fossil fuel imports. The effect of energy grid decarbonization and long-term scheduling of the retrofits were also examined. The results show that by 2050, the CO2 emissions of the building stock were reduced by 12-30% compared to the reference scenario with energy grid decarbonization, but no building energy retrofitting. A million euros invested into retrofitting created 15-17 jobs. Economic viability for the building owners was inversely correlated with the changes in tax revenues for the government. Cost-effective retrofitting reduced energy-based tax revenues more than it created new tax revenues through direct employment, thus providing a funding challenge for governments desiring to advance building retrofitting. However, more money would be left in the local economy due to reduced fossil fuel imports, but induced economic effects were not analyzed in this study.

J	Mallett, A; Pal, P				Mallett, Alexandra; Pal, Prosanto			Green transformation in the iron and steel industry in India: Rethinking patterns of innovation	ENERGY STRATEGY REVIEWS			English	Article							TECHNOLOGY; ENERGY	There is growing acknowledgement that industrial processes including the production of iron and steel are a pivotal area ripe for technological change if we are to effectively decarbonize, while concurrently industrialize countries of the Global South in a sustainable way. Innovation is an important element in advancing green (decarbonizing and reducing the environmental footprint) steel production. A narrow view of green steel production points to incremental changes that reduce carbon and other environmental footprints. However, insights from innovation systems and transformative innovation policy highlight the role of directionality of decarbonization pathways, arguing that greening steel will not come about without industrial transformation. This requires an overarching, systematic approach that broadens innovation to effectively transform industry towards decarbonization. Public policies provide mechanisms through which to realize these changes. We turn to the production of steel by large firms in India to ask: what technological innovation efforts are underway? What about the role of technology and innovation cooperation? Regarding the directionality of these pathways, to what extent could these efforts lead to green transformation of the production of steel in India? Drawing from interviews with informants with knowledge of this sector, and various government and industry documents, we found that there is a disconnect between what steel majors and government actors are doing in India - pursuing various activities and policies but doing so in a piecemeal fashion and not pivoting enough towards net zero -and the systemic approach that scholars indicate is fundamental to effectively green the steel sector. Secondly, in contrast to studies that argue that the bulk of international technology cooperation initiatives on R & D are led by the public sector, with the private sector becoming involved at latter stages, various Indian steel majors are actively working on international technology cooperation on R & D. Frontrunner India steel firms are taking proactive steps to produce their steel more sustainably. However, current efforts -principally led by the private sector and where the market for green steel is basically non-existent -to make the sector more sustainable are inadequate. We suggest that governments must play a larger role in promoting innovation to realize the green transformation of steel production in India. International collaboration and technology diffusion combined with national government efforts, which allow for the 'opening up' of innovation policy, have the potential to catalyze such systemic changes.

The potential role of Egypt as a natural gas supplier: A review	ENERGY REPORTS			English	Review						Natural gas; Exports; Decarbonization; Egypt	PERFORMANCE; EMISSIONS; DIESEL; ENERGY	The energy sector is the most greenhouse gas (GHG) emitting sector which is transitioning away to using less carbon-intensive fuels. The highlights the complexity of energy systems as well as the uncertainty surrounding the transition path, as governments must ensure not only environmental issues but also energy security and affordability. The energy transition away from oil and gas has implications for Egypt, which recently declared intentions to become a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export hub. Under these goals, the analysis of the existing status of global natural gas markets by focusing on natural gas importer countries in the European and the Asian markets by investigating natural gas demand in the context of the energy transition. The study investigates the links between economic growth, carbon emissions, and energy intensity to highlight the dependency of the economy on carbon-intensive energies to enhance the economic growth in Egypt, Europe, and Asia along with global energy pathways forecast the global and regional demand of natural gas. According to the findings, Egypt is expected to face difficulties in boosting its export share in the European market while the most promising destinations for future Egyptian natural gas exports are Asian countries. The study contextualizes the framework, which suggests the ways to reduce emissions in the gas upstream sector in Egypt by three actions; reducing flaring and venting operations, improving well integrity management, and regulating the abandonment of old wells.

J	Sheng, C				Sheng, Chunhong			Not just the state: The role of entrepreneurs in China's energy transition	ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Private entrepreneurs; Low-carbon industries; China	ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE; POLITICAL CONNECTIONS; SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAICS; INNOVATION; WIND; AUTHORITARIAN; CURTAILMENT; OWNERSHIP; EMERGENCE; HELP	The innovation of private entrepreneurs is changing the landscape of China's low-carbon manufacturing industries. This study explores the entry of private companies into China's energy sector, which is currently dominated by state-owned enterprises. Drawing on fragmented authoritarianism and entrepreneurship theory, this article explains how entrepreneurs are able to establish low-carbon companies and compete in this growing industry by staying alert to business opportunities, developing learning capability, taking more risks, and generating resources to pursue innovative strategies, even in a market that poses many threats and disadvantages for them. The article argues that, contrary to environmental authoritarianism, which positions state support as the main driver of decarbonization, entrepreneurs have made significant (and largely unacknowledged) contributions to decarbonization in China and the rest of the world. In particular, this study shows how governments may create more space for private entrepreneurs in order to help achieve energy transition and climate change on a global level.

J	Boute, A; Zhikharev, A				Boute, Anatole; Zhikharev, Alexey			Vested interests as driver of the clean energy transition: Evidence from Russia's solar energy policy	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Russia; Renewable energy policy; Local content requirements; Vested interests	RENEWABLE ENERGY; CONSTRAINING FACTORS; SUBSIDIES	By contrast to the common objective of decarbonization of electricity production, the main driver of Russia's renewable energy policy is to achieve the economic benefits related to the manufacturing of green equipment. The focus on industrial development rather than the decarbonization of the power sector clearly appears from the decision of the Russian government to tie renewable energy subsidies to stringent local content requirements. In particular, solar energy benefits from a subsidy regime that is favourable to local manufacturers. Based on a detailed analysis of Russian renewable energy regulation, this paper studies the benefits for solar generation and explains this favourable treatment based on the vested interests of influential industrial groups in the solar PV manufacturing sector. These vested interests helped to overcome the resistance to renewable energy in an economy heavily dependent on oil and gas. More fundamentally, the influence of the local solar energy industry enabled the development of a support scheme that eventually stimulated the deployment of renewable energy technologies in general.

In this context, the government released its 'Clean Growth Strategy' in October 2017, although it has a number of limitations. The associated technology roadmaps exhibit quite large uncertainties, and reducing carbon dioxide emissions over the long term will depend critically on the adoption of a small number of key technologies, alongside the 'decarbonisation' of electricity supply. 'Circular economy' interventions have the potential to make significant energy savings that are complementary to other energy-efficiency measures. However, the task for both industrial and policy decision makers will still be challenging.	[Cooper, Samuel J.

This research proposes a novel modelling approach that utilises easily accessible national-level data to identify the required heat storage volume in buildings to decrease peak power demand and maximises carbon reductions associated with electrified heating technologies through smart demand-side response. The approach assesses the optimal shifting of heat pump operation to meet thermal heating demand according to different heat storage capacities in buildings, which are defined in relation to the time (in hours) in which the heating demand can be provided directly from the heat battery, without heat pump operation. Ten scenarios (S) are analysed: two baselines (S1-S2) and eight load shifting strategies (S3-S10) based on hourly and daily demand-side responses. Moreover, they are compared with a reference scenario (S0), with heating currently based on fossil fuels. The approach was demonstrated in two different regions, Spain and the United Kingdom. The optimal heat storage capacity was found on the order of 12 and 24 h of heating demand in both countries, reducing additional power capacity by 30-37% and 40-46%, respectively. However, the environmental benefits of heat storage alternatives were similar to the baseline scenario due to higher energy consumption and marginal power generation based on fossil fuels. It was also found that load shifting capability below 4 h presents limited benefits, reducing additional power capacity by 10% at the national scale. The results highlight the importance of integrated heat storage technologies with the electrification of heat in highly gas-dependent regions. They can mitigate the need for an additional fossil-based dispatchable generation to meet high peak demand. The modelling approach provides a high-level strategy with regional specificity that, due to common datasets, can be easily replicated globally. For reproducibility, the code base and datasets are found on GitHub.

Inventories are essential for priority setting and for estimating impacts from the decarbonization transition. Here we present a new CO2 emissions inventory for all 116 572 municipal and local-government units in Europe, containing 108 000 cities at the smallest scale used. The inventory spatially disaggregates the national reported emissions, using nine spatialization methods to distribute the 167 line items detailed in the National Inventory Reports (NIRs) using the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) Common Reporting Framework (CRF). The novel contribution of this model is that results are provided per administrative jurisdiction at multiple administrative levels, following the region boundaries defined OpenStreetMap, using a new spatialization approach.

This review paper is focused on analysing the challenges and opportunities that are related to green and blue hydrogen, which are at the basis of different perspectives of a potential hydrogen society. While many governments and private companies are putting significant resources on the development of hydrogen technologies, there still remains a high number of unsolved issues, including technical challenges, economic and geopolitical implications. The hydrogen supply chain includes a large number of steps, resulting in additional energy losses, and while much focus is put on hydrogen generation costs, its transport and storage should not be neglected. A low-carbon hydrogen economy offers promising opportunities not only to fight climate change, but also to enhance energy security and develop local industries in many countries. However, to face the huge challenges of a transition towards a zero-carbon energy system, all available technologies should be allowed to contribute based on measurable indicators, which require a strong international consensus based on transparent standards and targets.

Reports and analyses have focused on the technical and economic challenges of introducing networked heat provision in a country where this is a relatively novel energy service. Meanwhile, there has been little emphasis on the spatial and physical aspects of heat provision and their influence on the spatial development of cities. In this paper, we contribute to current debates on urban energy transitions with insights on the implications of heat networks to cities including scale, density, mixed-use, and materiality. The study reveals the embeddedness of energy services and the emergence of new forms of local governance that combine spatial and energy planning to realize new urban energy landscapes.

This low-carbon transition will not boil down to a new Industrial Revolution and the lessons learned from past events will not necessarily be usable as they stand. Namely, we draw attention to the spontaneous nature of past energy transitions. Unlike past transitions, the low-carbon energy transition will not happen spontaneously and will require active coordination between all actors at global, national and local levels, coupled with controls to effectively target a carbon neutrality goal. The role of governments will be crucial to steer this process.

In this paper, we apply a long-term energy planning model, with the objective of finding the set of technologies that meet strong reductions of CO2 emissions and of local PM2.5 concentrations. For this purpose, we use the existing ETEM-Chile (Energy-Technology-Environment-Model) model which considers a simplified version of the Chilean electricity sector that we extend to the residential and commercial sectors and to local concentration considerations. We propose an original approach to integrate in the same framework local and global emission constraints. Results show that to meet the goal of zero emissions by 2050, electrification of end-use demands increases up to 49.2% with a strong growth of the CO2 marginal cost. It should be noted that this electrification rate is much lower than government projections and those usually found in the literature, in certain geographic areas in southern Chile with a wide availability of firewood for residential heating. Regarding local PM2.5 concentrations, our analysis shows that even without a specific emission reduction target, acceptable PM2.5 concentrations are achieved by 2045, due to first the emergence of more efficient, cleaner and cost-effective end-use technologies, in particular, residential firewood heaters, and second the use of drier and therefore less contaminating firewood. Achieving acceptable air quality as early as 2030 is also possible but comes with a high marginal cost of PM2.5 concentration.

Developing mainly in the field of information and communications technology, ethical governance is concerned with the marginalisation of ethical and moral issues during development and deployment of new technologies. Focusing on early carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) projects, we argue that a focus on technical arguments in the governance of low-carbon energy similarly risks sidelining deeper issues such as fairness, justice, and values. We believe an ethical governance approach does have potential for low-carbon energy technologies like CCS, but also that climate change mitigation technologies pose particular challenges for the implementation of ethical governance.

As most inverter-based generators provide neither inertia nor contribute to system strength. This paper investigates the impact of minimum system demand on the future system stability of the Queensland network, as well as the effect on the wholesale electricity market. Failure to mitigate these problems would delay the Queensland Government's decarbonisation goal and reduce the safety, reliability and affordability of electricity supply.

By allowing increased penetration of renewables, thus increasing the amount of renewable energy which can be utilised, one potential technology which is able to assist the decarbonisation of both the electricity and process heat sectors is high temperature thermal energy storage (TES). In addition to providing a source of energy storage, these systems can utilise waste-based products from other industries such as steel making, asbestos processing, combustion, potash production, mining and minerals processing, or glass recycling as the storage media. The usage of such materials can not only be cost-effective, but also increase sustainability to further their participation in a circular economy which is crucial to reduce our dependence on virgin materials. Therefore, the current study aims to provide an overview of the available materials which could be utilised for high temperature thermal storage between 200-750 degrees C.

Understanding the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor's energy portfolio	WORLD DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVES			English	Article						Belt and Road Initiative; Climate change; Pakistan; Coal; China; Decarbonisation	SECURITY	Pakistan has sought to meet its increasing energy needs using coal-based energy generation. In this paper, we explore how the Pakistani government sought and obtained financing for coal-fired power plants from China. We analyze Pakistan's partnership with China to develop energy projects via the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. Based on interviews with key decision-makers and stakeholders, we show how the Pakistani government's policies have steered Chinese investment towards coal-fired power plants. Chinese actors were most willing to match Pakistan's desire to construct coal-fired power plants and exploit coal resources with financing. Chinese actors have also displayed risk aversion, which has translated into steep economic costs for Pakistan. This case study provides a fine-grained analysis of the demand drivers of China-backed coal finance. It complements the existing literature's focus on the supply of Chinese finance. This paper identifies how project-level and policy-level factors can draw in investments into the coal sector. As countries seek decarbonize their economies, this case study illustrates how and why incumbent technologies like coal are receiving preferential policy support over renewables.

J	Thess, A; Klein, M; Nienhaus, K; Pregger, T				Thess, Andre; Klein, Martin; Nienhaus, Kristina; Pregger, Thomas			Global carbon surcharge for the reduction of anthropogenic emission of carbon dioxide	ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Global carbon surcharge; Climate policy; Decarbonization; Carbon pricing		Background Many governments take the view that voluntary national targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are sufficient to avoid negative climate effects. In the absence of independent verification, however, pledges are unlikely to be sufficient for a rapid and strong reduction of emissions. It is often claimed that a global carbon tax could be an effective instrument. However, such a tax is difficult to set and to collect, especially in countries with poor administrative infrastructure. Results Here, we formulate and discuss a novel approach, the Global Carbon Surcharge (GCS), that mimics a carbon tax but does not require tax collection by governments. We define GCS as a requirement or a voluntary commitment encompassing all companies extracting carbon-carrying raw materials, namely coal, oil, gas and limestone, with the aim to burden their extraction with costs proportional to their carbon intensity. GCS mandates all companies to store these materials immediately after mining for a given period of time in the vicinity of the production site. Thereby, GCS generates additional costs that propagate through all sectors of the global economy. We elucidate how the investment costs for the storage infrastructure translate into surcharges on the raw materials. Conclusions We show that by a proper choice of the storage time and the size of the storage unit, GCS becomes equivalent to a carbon tax in the range between 50 and 100 euro per ton of CO2 that is assumed to be necessary for the transition to a carbon-neutral energy system. An attractive feature of GCS is that it can be verified, in particular by citizens themselves, using publicly available satellite data. Finally, if compulsory storage is coupled to blockchain-based smart contracts and a mandatory (expensive) mining of cryptocurrency, GCS can be operated without governmental protectionism, corruption and fraud. However, the main uncertainties of the GCS approach lie in the substantial expansion of infrastructure and the fact that the induced price effects must be sufficient to achieve a rapid and far-reaching substitution of fossil fuels.

With electricity consumption dropping, consumption patterns changing, international fuel prices oscillating and uncertainty raging, the pandemic has affected not least the planning of investments in electricity supply. Although the government seems unlikely to revise the decarbonisation targets downwards, questions arise on whether the investments planned before the pandemic are still relevant in the changed global landscape and what effects they may have on the country's economy. In this study, we analyse post-pandemic scenarios for the electricity supply system of Tunisia with an energy economy modelling framework, soft-linking the energy modelling tool OSeMOSYS and an open source Input Output model. We extract insights on the cost-competitiveness of different - previously planned and new - electricity supply solutions and their impacts on job creation and loss in the entire economy. We find that renewable solutions based on solar photovoltaic remain highly competitive with gas-fired generation under different projections of gas prices and that several low-carbon and energy efficiency solutions have high potential for job creation. We also find that more ambitious investments in renewables and energy efficiency are needed to take Tunisia towards the path of deep decarbonisation.

To protect public health and stabilize incomes, governments have implemented massive fiscal stimulus packages. These fiscal supports are crucial, though there is concern that sustainable and resilient development will be sacrificed in the rush to preserve incomes and industries. The aim of the paper is to review whether the Japanese governments' responses in terms of financial stimulus considers longer term resilience and sustainability. This paper reviews pertinent academic literature and publicly available data from governments and organisations. The research is a rapid analysis of emerging information provided by the government of Japan and other international organisations. Using the case of Japan, this paper suggests that it is possible both to protect public health and essential services, while also promoting resilience and sustainability. Japan's integrated solutions show that pandemic response can include accelerated decarbonization and resilient, sustainable development. The paper also warns also that failure to act on longterm sustainability risks increased inequality, higher opportunity costs, cascading hazards, and further retreat from planetary thinking and globalism.

Thus, they are now confronted with the task of implementing the chief objectives of the COP21: halting and reducing CO2 emissions stopping deforestation and desertification, and promoting long-term decarbonisation of their economies in a wide sense. The policy process envisaged is a decentralised one, with each government defining its ends and means. The COP21 puts enormous responsibility on Asian countries, as this region has the most CO2 emissions of all regions in the world and its energy consumption is predicted to continue to grow at a fast rate. Yet, policy implementation is difficult to conduct in a successful manner.

Critically reviewing smart home technology applications and business models in Europe	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Smart home technologies; Smart energy; 'Prosumers '; Decarbonisation	ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; INTERNET; INNOVATION; EXPECTATIONS; GOVERNANCE; PROTECTION; VISIONS; KEY	Smart home technologies refer to devices that provide some degree of digitally connected or enhanced services to occupants. Smart homes have become central in recent technology and policy discussions about energy efficiency, climate change, and innovation. However, many studies are speculative, lacking empirical data, and focus on costs and benefits, but not business models and emerging markets. To address these gaps, our study presents data from semi-structured expert interviews and a review of the recent literature. Although we draw from empirical data collected in the United Kingdom, we place our findings in the context of Europe because the UK has access to European markets for smart home technologies and platforms. Our sampling strategy included experts from Amazon, Microsoft, the International Energy Agency, government, academic, and civil society stakeholders. We identify a diversity of definitions associated with smart home technologies and draw from our data to discuss applications centred on digital connections, enhanced control, automation, and learning. We analyse fifteen distinct business models for smart home technologies, ranging from energy services and household data monitoring to assisted living, security and safety, and new advertising channels (among others). Our assessment ought to guide future innovation patterns, technology deployment, and policy activity relating to smart homes, especially insofar as they can deliver energy services more affordably or help meeting carbon mitigation priorities.

Although many municipalities have already introduced energy requirements and metrics to promote new high performing and net zero con-structions, decarbonization of existing residential buildings suffers from a lack of a clear roadmap. This study establishes a comprehensive roadmap for decarbonization and electrification of typical existing single-family houses in Canada in two different climate zones. A typical single-family dwelling-with two floors and a basement was energetically modeled and the results were validated versus utility bills. Afterwards, a range of energy conservation scenarios and measures were applied to the case study building using an individual and cumulative approach, with an analysis of the energy use and carbon footprint reductions. The results indicated that when a phased approach for the retrofits is considered, an approximate invest-ment of 40,000 CAD could result in 78% energy saving and 96% emissions reduction in an existing residential building in Ontario. For Vancouver, the energy and emission savings are reported as 85% and 100%. The results were further investigated using a sensitivity analysis considering future scenarios for grid emissions and carbon costs. Finally, an embodied carbon inventory analysis was conducted showing that, in particular, the positive impacts of adding exterior wall insulation dominantly sways the negative impact of its carbon footprint from material production. The study con-cludes by highlighting the key findings and presenting a number of avenues for future research.

Strategic framing and the challenges facing coal dependent communities	ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING C-POLITICS AND SPACE			English	Article						Strategic framing; place framing; regional policy; Australia; decarbonization	POLITICAL-ECONOMY; POLICY; GOVERNANCE; SCALE; CONSTRUCTION; INSTITUTIONS; REGION; FRAMES; EAST	Policies designed to hasten the closure of high-emissions coal-fired power stations routinely include reference to the need for a 'just' transition in affected communities. But the detail of what a just transition might entail is rarely specified. This article examines how policy interventions in Australia in 2012-2013, as part of the Gillard government's Clean Energy Future package, approached the problem of a just transition in the case of Victoria's coal dependent Latrobe Valley. It describes how policymakers framed the issue as transition, adopted a regional scaling, and expanded the territorial arena of policy action. A stakeholder-based multilevel governance committee shrouded this top-down decision-making from public scrutiny. These moves made it possible to conjure a narrative of benign transition governed by market processes. The paper explains how these strategic framings sidelined local interests, misrepresented the issues, exacerbated local disempowerment, and enabled the redirection of re-distributional funding to communities that were not directly affected by the impending closure of coal-fired power stations. The perceived injustice of this process exposes the limitations of climate policy-related strategic issue, scale and place framing.

Yet stakeholders lack a shared understanding of how the 17 SDGs can be operationalized. Drawing on earlier work by The World in 2050 initiative, we introduce six SDG Transformations as modular building-blocks of SDG achievement: (1) education, gender and inequality; (2) health, well-being and demography; (3) energy decarbonization and sustainable industry; (4) sustainable food, land, water and oceans; (5) sustainable cities and communities; and (6) digital revolution for sustainable development. Each Transformation identifies priority investments and regulatory challenges, calling for actions by well-defined parts of government working with business and civil society. Transformations may therefore be operationalized within the structures of government while respecting the strong interdependencies across the 17 SDGs. We also outline an action agenda for science to provide the knowledge required for designing, implementing and monitoring the SDG Transformations.

Cost-effective renewable energy has largely been achieved, but there appear to be substantial barriers to building new renewable energy facilities. We identified 53 utility-scale wind, solar, and geothermal energy projects that were delayed or blocked between 2008 and 2021 in 28 U.S. states. Using multi-level qualitative analysis, we have identified seven key sources of opposition. Of the projects we studied, 34% faced significant delays and difficulties securing permits, 49% were cancelled permanently, and 26% resumed after being stopped for several months or years. Project delays and cancellations account for potential lost generating capacity of almost 4600 MW. State and local governments and renewable energy developers need to pay closer attention to the full range of socially-oriented sources of opposition to new facilities.

J	Green, F; Gambhir, A				Green, Fergus; Gambhir, Ajay			Transitional assistance policies for just, equitable and smooth low-carbon transitions: who, what and how?	CLIMATE POLICY			English	Article						Just transition; climate change mitigation; transitions; structural adjustment assistance; compensation; state capacities	ENERGY TRANSITIONS; POLITICAL-ECONOMY; CLIMATE POLICY; ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE; SUSTAINABILITY; JUSTICE; POWER; INSTITUTIONS; CAPITALISM; IDENTITIES	While the decarbonization of the global economy will bring immense benefits in the aggregate and to many individuals, it will also be disruptive and costly for some, at least in the short term. As these disruptions and costs have become increasingly salient in recent years, there has been an explosion of interest in the climate policy community about how low-carbon transitions can be implemented justly, equitably, and politically smoothly. A key part of what is needed in responding to this growing interest is a better understanding of the suite of 'transitional assistance policies' and strategies that can be deployed, alongside or as part of climate change mitigation policies and processes. Responding to this need, we survey a wide, multi-disciplinary literature to answer the 'who', 'what' and 'how' of transitional assistance policy: who is likely to be adversely affected by the low-carbon transition, and in what ways? What substantive strategies and policy instruments are available to governments to mitigate the burdens of low-carbon transitions? And how can governments implement such strategies and policies successfully? In the course of answering the first two of these questions, we develop a novel typology of transitional assistance policies, in which multiple policies are parsimoniously classified according to one of four coherent policy strategies, and one of five kinds of beneficiaries. In answering the third question, we emphasize the importance of certain 'state capacities' for shaping transition processes and managing vested interests. Key policy insights Without transitional assistance policies, consumers, workers, businesses, specially-affected communities, and states that are highly dependent on emissions-intensive assets stand to lose from decarbonization. Transitional assistance policies can be narrow (addressing financial losses only) or broad (addressing a wider range of losses), and conservative (backward-looking) or adaptive (forward-looking). Combining these elements yields four coherent transitional assistance strategies: compensation; exemption; structural adjustment assistance; and comprehensive adaptive support. Comprehensive adaptive support strategies have greatest potential for just, equitable and smooth transition outcomes, but are costlier and more complex to implement. State capacities to steer complex, long-term transitions are therefore a crucial variable in transition success.

TOURISM RECREATION RESEARCH			English	Article						Decarbonisation; carbon footprint; neoliberalism; tourism system; governance; destinations	ACCOMMODATION; ENERGY; INNOVATION; POLICY	The tourism industry collectively seeks to portray itself as being proactive in embracing climate action, but is the sector doing enough to decarbonise to the extent agreed on in the Paris Agreement? This paper presents a constructive critique of the key mechanisms that presently define the global travel and tourism industry's attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Six challenges are identified and each constitutes a major hurdle to rapid and substantial progress. These are: tourism's embeddedness in the prevailing growth paradigm, the institutionalisation of interests, the nature of policy making, the inadequacy of incremental improvements, the focus on technological efficiency instead of (behavioural) conservation, and the global distribution of tourism. The paper concludes by suggesting that only systemic changes at a large scale will be sufficient to break or disrupt existing arrangements and routines. Tourism academics should contribute to identifying and helping to implement solutions, but this will require much greater collaboration with the industry and government, as well as with researchers from a broad range of disciplines.

J	Andrade, C; Selosse, S; Maizi, N				Andrade, Carlos; Selosse, Sandrine; Maizi, Nadia			The role of power-to-gas in the integration of variable renewables	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Long-term modelling; TIMES PACA; Low-carbon transition; Renewable energy integration; Power-to-gas; Hydrogen	ENERGY-STORAGE; SOLAR POWER; SYSTEMS; HYDROGEN; FUTURE; TECHNOLOGY; METHANE; EXCESS; IMPACT	Limiting the rise in global temperatures requires the rapid, and massive deployment of solutions to reduce carbon emissions at all levels. The development of intermittent renewable energy resources has received significant support from governments, and its production will considerably increase. The introduction of this high electrical production presents some challenges, in particular, the allocation of high production in low consumption periods. One of the most promoted solutions to cope with this challenge is the integration of power-to-gas technologies (P2G). In this area, the European Union and some of its members have presented plans supporting the production and consumption of hydrogen. At the same time, it should be noted that the development strategies for these technologies are largely deployed at the local level. To allow local territories to contribute to the decarbonization of the energy system, national governments are extending the application of their energy policy to local areas. This is the case in France, which over the last decades has adopted laws to extend the application of its energy policy at local level, with the objective of ensuring better, faster deployment of its energy transition and reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. As a result, the French regions have targeted objectives for the development of their local energy resources. The SUD Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur Region (PACA) in southern France, in response to these air, energy, environment, and climate change adaptation responsibilities, has set a target to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. This will involve the massive development of solar photovoltaic production as the region has considerable access to solar resources. The region has also presented a hydrogen plan to support the development of this energy in the region and contribute to national efforts. This study, conducted with TIMESPACA a bottom-up optimization model representing the energy system of the PACA region, analyzes how P2G technologies contribute to the development of solar resources. Results show that P2G technologies are essential for the decarbonization of the regional energy system and the deployment of renewables, that they are required to reach national and global decarbonization objectives, and that they are expected to structure the whole hydrogen chain.

In the last two decades, several carbon pricing policies have been implemented or debated at the state and federal levels in the US. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and the California cap-and-trade policy are the two regional policies operational today. While there is no federal policy operational today, several carbon pricing proposals have been introduced in Congress in the last decade. Using the literature on interest group politics and policy entrepreneurship, this article examines the carbon pricing policies at the subnational and federal levels in the US. First, the article explores the evolution of two main regional carbon pricing policies, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and California cap-and-trade, to identify how interest groups and policy entrepreneurs shaped the design and implementation of the respective policies. Second, the article details the federal carbon pricing policy proposals and bills discussed in the last decade. Third, it examines the factors that limit the prospects of realizing an ambitious federal carbon price for pursuing deep decarbonization of the US economy. The article finds that federal carbon pricing in the US suffers from the lack of any natural and/or consistent constituency to support it through policy development, legislation, and implementation. While interest group politics have been mitigated by good policy entrepreneurship at the subnational level, the lack of policy entrepreneurship and the changing positions of competing interest groups have kept a federal carbon pricing policy from becoming a reality.

Local governments are central to the delivery of action on both decarbonisation and adapting to the risks of climate change. Yet there are likely to be significant differences across local governments in terms of their capacity to act on climate change. This research documents and explains differences in the capacity to act within response spaces to risks to transport infrastructure and systems. We examine 80 Transport Plans across local governments in England, specifically their efforts to incorporate climate change adaptation. Data are generated from content analysis of the 80 documents and key informant interviews in a sample of 15% of authorities. The results show significant disparities across authorities. We explain differential outcomes as dependent on internal coordination, local prioritisation processes and political opposition. The results highlight that there are significant governance barriers associated with differential response capacity in the face of climate change risks.	[Walker, Benjamin J.

To evaluate the profits of different suppliers under certain policy combinations, models are developed on a 2-period 2-department economy. Empirical study on Guangdong Province, China shows that policies do promote usage of RES-E, but should be adjusted to stimulate fossil departments implementing researches on decarbonization. This research provides a micro perspective of how individuals would react to energy policies and how should government set policy combinations that would bring the biggest stimulation to market participants to adopt cleaner production path.

J	Saffari, M; Beagon, P				Saffari, Mohammad; Beagon, Paul			Home energy retrofit: Reviewing its depth, scale of delivery, and sustainability	ENERGY AND BUILDINGS			English	Article						Home energy retrofit; Residential energy use; Urban spatial scale; Home energy upgrade; Neighbourhoods; Districts; Sustainability	RESIDENTIAL SECTOR; NORTHERN-IRELAND; FUEL POVERTY; URBAN ENERGY; EFFICIENCY; CONSUMPTION; PERFORMANCE; BUILDINGS; NEIGHBORHOODS; TECHNOLOGY	Home energy retrofit has been a publicly-funded policy in many countries since the 1990s. Government motivations have spanned from combating energy poverty to climate action and sustainability. Given the ambition of public policy, this paper reviews the targets, spatial scales and metrics used to deliver and evaluate home energy retrofit. Large-scale retrofit projects do differ: by spatial area, by retrofit depth and in evaluation metrics (if used). This review surveys first, the quantities of homes and inhabitants in intermediate spatial scales used to plan retrofit programmes. Second, the optimal spatial scale and retrofit depth to deliver largescale home retrofit. Third, the quantitative metrics to evaluate retrofits, and future trends in occupantbased metrics. Neighbourhood is found to be the optimal spatial scale for home energy retrofit. Deep retrofit is described as 60% energy savings that, in synergy with energy supply decarbonisation, promises to deliver 80% or higher emission reductions. Recent evidence shows a shifting primacy from fabric-first retrofit to decarbonisation of heat generation and occupant health and well-being. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

BULLETIN OF THE ATOMIC SCIENTISTS			English	Article						Green economy; decarbonize; carbon footprint; divestment; climate change; global warming		Large-scale structural change is essential if we are to decarbonize the economy rapidly enough to avert the worst of global warming. Individual actions by the well-meaning won't be enough. Yet the two aren't mutually exclusive, and there are both moral and pragmatic reasons to do both at the same time. Individuals must act collectively, as engaged citizens, to push governments and fossil fuel companies to change their behavior. But actions to reduce our own individual carbon footprints can also change the culture so that political change in favor of decarbonization becomes more likely.

A social science and humanities research agenda for geothermal energy	ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Assemblage; Socio-technical systems; Imaginaries; Infrastructures; Narratives; Geothermal	SOCIOTECHNICAL TRANSITION; SOCIETAL ACCEPTANCE; SUSTAINABILITY; TECHNOLOGIES; INNOVATION; DYNAMICS; SYSTEMS; POLICY; OIL; OWNERSHIP	The potential of geothermal energy for energy transition is increasingly recognized by governments around the world. Whether geothermal energy is a sustainable source of heat and/or electricity depends on how it is deployed in specific contexts. Therefore, it is striking that there is only limited attention to geothermal energy from a social science and humanities (SSH) perspective. Geothermal energy is largely conceptualized as a technological and/or geological issue in both science and practice. This perspective article aims to go beyond such conceptualizations by positioning social science research as an important lens to explore the promises and pitfalls of geothermal energy. We first provide an overview of the current state of geothermal energy as a decarbonization strategy. Second, we move on to review the existing literature. This review shows that studies that do address geothermal energy from an SSH perspective tend to be of a descriptive nature and lack analytical diversity. Third, we discuss three complementary theoretical approaches that are used in the social sciences to observe and address other forms of energy and energy transition. We believe that socio-technical assemblages, systems, and imaginaries can provide fruitful analytical lenses to study the promises, pitfalls and spatialization of geothermal energy. We conclude the paper with a research agenda and call for further engagement with this topic in SSH research, with attention to specificities of global South and North contexts.

Furthermore, the government has also set a goal of reducing its CO2 emissions to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Additionally, the Korean government submitted an enhanced update of the first NDC at the end of 2021. In the electricity sector, the updated NDC proposed the GHG emissions target of 149.9 million tons in 2030. In this study, we model eight scenarios based on future energy mix and demand forecast considering the government's latest plans to evaluate the possible emission reduction and impacts in the electricity sector. The scenario-based analysis is conducted to check whether it can satisfy the CO2 reduction target by using PLEXOS, a production simulation model. The results show that emission reduction targets are difficult to accomplish in the short term and can lead to significant changes in the operation of generators and increased costs to realize the decarbonization pathway.

Achieving renewable energy, climate, and air quality policy goals: Rural residential investment in solar panel	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Air quality; Decarbonization; GHG emission; Solar energy; Survey; Purchase price	ATTITUDES; ADOPTION; EFFICIENT; BEHAVIOR	Heavy dependence on fossil fuels among rural households contributes to GHG emissions and air pollution while increasing landfill loads in Poland. This study examines benefits from the renewable energy utilization support program that subsidized household purchase and installation of thermal solar panels. This review of synergy between energy, climate, and air quality policies focuses on solar panel subsidies funded through the European Union and county governments in Mazowieckie Voivodship in Poland. County government offices, using the unpublished list of households receiving subsidies for thermal solar panel installation, mediated in the implementation of the survey and collected 123 completed questionnaires in May and June 2015. The heteroscedasticity-corrected OLS estimates two equations identifying and quantifying factors influencing the purchase price of solar panels and rural household monthly energy bill savings after installation using the gathered data. Among sociodemographic variables, increasing age was associated with an increasing price paid for the panels, but education was associated with paying a lower price for solar panels and lower self-reported energy bill savings. Panel purchase price increased if the respondent was a farmer, viewed subsidies as important, and preferred domestically manufactured panels. Location of household increased the price as compared to the reference county. Savings on monthly energy bills increased if respondent had a positive view of solar energy, expected a decrease in the bill following the purchase of panels, and heated large areas in the house. Subsidy programs have been important in increased household solar energy utilization, especially among farm households, while self-reported energy bill savings increased with positive attitudes towards renewable energy and the larger heated areas in rural residences.

J	Ayers, K				Ayers, Katherine			Gigawatt-scale renewable hydrogen via water splitting as a case study for collaboration: The need to connect fundamental and applied research to accelerate solutions	MRS ENERGY & SUSTAINABILITY			English	Review						electrochemical synthesis; energy storage; H		Sustainable, carbon-free methods of large-scale hydrogen production are urgently needed to support industrial processes while decreasing carbon dioxide emissions. The realities of product development timelines dictate that existing commercial technologies such as low-temperature electrolysis will have to serve the majority of this need for at least the next 20 years. At the same time, even a cursory understanding of device design principles and real-world constraints can help to inform basic research. Accelerating the impact from fundamental material discoveries in related technologies therefore requires improved collaboration between academic, government, and industry sectors. Renewable hydrogen is a key component to global decarbonization and reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. A common misconception is that the need for greener sources of hydrogen is dependent on whether fuel cell vehicles significantly penetrate the automotive market. However, hydrogen is a critical feedstock for many industrial processes, with an annual demand of 65 million metric tons globally. The large majority of this hydrogen is made via steam methane reforming, which represents the major carbon dioxide contribution for industrial processes such as ammonia production. Sustainable manufacturing of hydrocarbons also requires a sustainable source of hydrogen. Deep decarbonization and meeting 80% reduction targets for carbon dioxide emissions thus requires carbon-free sources of hydrogen. Based on the technology readiness levels, the reality is that existing commercial technologies will dominate the market for the next 20 years and beyond. To accelerate the impact of fundamental work in long-term technologies, improved collaboration between researchers across academic, government, and industry sectors is essential, to inform basic research as well as to leverage technology breakthroughs in the near term.

This renewable fuel undergoes a continuous process of technological innovation that cannot be ignored by the Spanish legislator. Without renewable hydrogen, the objectives of the fight against climate change cannot be achieved, and this is the main challenge for governments, industry and consumers.

Optimal strategies to accelerate EV adoption must weigh the relative value of alternative policy mechanisms to consumers, including public charging infrastructure and vehicle purchase subsidies. We use a historically validated light-duty vehicle consumer choice tool, the ADOPT model, to simulate personal light-duty vehicle adoption and related emissions in California. ADOPT is updated to incorporate a quantification of the tangible value of public charging infrastructure, allowing us to simulate the impact of investments in public charging infrastructure and vehicle purchase subsidies under different scenarios. We show that both policies result in increased EV adoption, with the most effective policy varying depending on vehicle technology assumptions. Under conservative technology improvement assumptions, infrastructure investments are most effective in promoting EV sales and reducing CO2 & nbsp;emissions, while under optimistic technology improvement assumptions a combination of infrastructure and subsidies best supports EV sales and CO2 & nbsp;emission reductions.

A retrospective analysis of funding and focus in US advanced fission innovation	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						nuclear power; advanced reactors; energy innovation; federal research and development		Deep decarbonization of the global energy system will require large investments in energy innovation and the deployment of new technologies. While many studies have focused on the expenditure that will be needed, here we focus on how government has spent public sector resources on innovation for a key carbon-free technology: advanced nuclear. We focus on nuclear power because it has been contributing almost 20% of total US electric generation, and because the US program in this area has historically been the world's leading effort. Using extensive data acquired through the Freedom of Information Act, we reconstruct the budget history of the Department of Energy's programto develop advanced, non-light water nuclear reactors. Our analysis shows that-despite spending $2 billion since the late 1990s-no advanced design is ready for deployment. Even if the program had been well designed, it still would have been insufficient to demonstrate even one non-light water technology. It has violated much of the wisdom about the effective execution of innovative programs: annual funding varies fourfold, priorities are ephemeral, incumbent technologies and fuels are prized over innovation, and infrastructure spending consumes half the budget. Absent substantial changes, the possibility of US-designed advanced reactors playing a role in decarbonization by mid-century is low.	[Abdulla, A.; Victor, D.

J	Serrano, DP; Dufour, J; Iribarren, D				Serrano, David P.; Dufour, Javier; Iribarren, Diego			On the feasibility of producing hydrogen with net carbon fixation by the decomposition of vegetable and microalgal oils	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; BIODIESEL PRODUCTION; HYDROCARBON FUELS; FATTY-ACIDS; CATALYTIC CONVERSION; PALM OIL; ENERGY; BIOFUELS; EMISSIONS; CRACKING	The decomposition of vegetable and microalgal oils was herein analysed as a process of high interest for the production of both hydrogen and carbon, which potentially entails the advantage of attaining a negative CO2 balance through carbon fixation. The feasibility of a series of oil decarbonization systems was evaluated by means of energy and CO2 balances, which comprised not only the direct decarbonization process itself but also the cultivation and oil extraction stages. Three potential scenarios were assessed, embracing different options to meet the energy requirements of the systems. For each scenario, a wide range of case studies were evaluated, involving the use of rapeseed, sunflower, soybean, jatropha, Botryococcus braunii and Chlorella vulgaris oils as raw materials. Favourable energy and CO2 balances were found for a variety of crops in different scenarios. In particular, jatropha oil from high seed yield crops and rapeseed oil from high seed yield and high oil content crops were identified as the most promising biomass feedstocks for oil decarbonization since they led to net hydrogen production as well as to negative balances of CO2 emissions, therefore showing a carbon fixation effect. When compared to vegetable/microalgal oil transesterification to produce biodiesel, oil decomposition proved to be a more suitable alternative from a combined energy and environmental approach.

The current Renewable Obligation scheme is considered not capable to meet future supply requirements and UK's ambitious decarbonization target. Therefore, the government adjusted the renewable support scheme to the feed-in tariff with contract for difference scheme, which is believed to provide renewable generators' more confidence in renewable plants installation. A fitness model is proposed to assess renewable subsidy schemes' performance. Their performances are compared under their optimum subsidy strategies via a dynamic optimization method that can characterize the market expanding effects. This study demonstrates that CfD is a more efficient and cost-effective renewable incentive scheme.

J	Rhodes, E; Scott, WA; Jaccard, M				Rhodes, Ekaterina; Scott, William A.; Jaccard, Mark			Designing flexible regulations to mitigate climate change: A cross-country comparative policy analysis	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Flexible climate regulations; Comparative policy analysis; Emission reductions; Political acceptability; Climate policy	LOW-CARBON FUEL; RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARDS; ENERGY EFFICIENCY STANDARDS; GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; ENVIRONMENTAL-POLICY; PUBLIC PREFERENCES; ECONOMY STANDARDS; CITIZEN SUPPORT; IMPACTS; STATE	Carbon pricing is widely recognized as the most economically efficient policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, its high-cost visibility creates political challenges for its implementation at a sufficiently stringent level to achieve deep decarbonization. Flexible regulations, such as renewable portfolio standards and low-carbon fuels standards, incorporate flexibility mechanisms similar to carbon pricing, but seem to face lessor political acceptability barriers. Unlike prescriptive (command-and-control) regulations, flexible regulations do not require technologically-specific compliance pathways and allow credit trading to reduce costs and incentivize innovation. Despite their potential for driving the decarbonization transition, there is comparatively little research on the design and impact of flexible regulations implemented to date. This comparative policy analysis examines government policy documents and academic literature to identify flexible climate regulations implemented in OECD countries and evaluates their implementation context, design characteristics, effectiveness, and public support. In total, 61 unique flexible regulations were identified across 11 countries and 42 sub-national jurisdictions that can be classified into six categories. Findings suggest that as jurisdictions seek to strengthen their climate policy portfolios, flexible regulations can provide a relatively cost effective, broadly supported, and complementary tool to achieve deep emissions reductions, so long as policies are well-designed and interaction and equity impacts are considered.

Renewable energy (RE) is needed for the low-carbon future envisioned in the 2015 Paris climate change agreement. This article comparatively evaluates the RE performance of two states in Australia to show how government policies affect energy transitions. The "complex systems" perspective is used as a theoretical lens and it elucidates the constraints to RE transitions. Ambitious targets at state level and sustained political support are required to overcome the multi-dimensional barriers to RE transitions. However, given the complexity of the energy system, it is argued that governments should pursue collaborative efforts across states and with various stakeholders to avoid conflicts, while addressing concerns about rising electricity prices and energy security if the much needed decarbonisation of the electricity sector is to take place.

One technology that is expected to contribute significantly is heat pumps, both air and ground source. However, recent field trial results suggest that heat pumps in the UK are not delivering to performance expectations. This paper looks at the implications of these results for the UK housing stock's future CO2 emissions. The English Housing Condition Survey dataset is used as the basis for a Monte Carlo simulation in order to model CO2 emissions and energy consumption for the whole of English housing stock out to 2050. The results suggest that, given the current UK electricity grid CO2 emission factor, in the short term poor heat pump performance could lead to a rise in emissions where natural gas boilers are displaced. In the longer term, heat pumps can realise emissions reductions when installed at high penetration levels when combined with a grid decarbonisation strategy. Until grid decarbonisation occurs, an alternative phased strategy is proposed that includes phased replacement of resistive electric heating, first in households in fuel poverty and then the remainder of properties with this heating type. Following this phased strategy, real emissions savings are possible along with a potential reduction in fuel poverty.

Using the system optimisation model OPERA, the authors have analysed the technology, sector and cost implications of the assumptions underlying these scenarios. While the roles of a number of key energy technology and emission mitigation options are strongly dependent on the scenario and cost assumptions, the analysis yields several common elements that appear in both scenarios and that consistently appear under differing cost assumptions. For example, one of the main options for the decarbonisation of the Dutch energy system is electrification of energy use in end-use sectors and for the production of renewable hydrogen with electrolysers. As a result the level of electricity generation in 2050 will be three to four times higher than present generation levels. Ultimately, renewable energy - particularly from wind turbines and solar panels - is projected to account for the vast majority of electricity generation, around 99% in 2050. Imbalances between supply and demand resulting from this variable renewable electricity production can be managed via flexibility options, including demand response and energy storage. Hydrogen also becomes an important energy carrier, notably for transportation and in industry. If import prices are lower than costs of domestic production from natural gas with CCS or through electrolysis from renewable electricity (2.4-2.7 euro /kgH(2)), the use of hydrogen increases, especially in the built environment.

How can such actions be understood within a wider context of geopolitical competition and the international political economy of an emerging global solar industry? This article proposes that a "Solar Trilemma" could be a key concept for understanding the geo- (or helio-) politics of a new era. It analyzes how renewed solar protectionism counteracts against past progress, and opens the way for a return to the counterproductive economic conflicts and "managed trade" of the 1970s and 1980s; for the energy transition as a whole, decarbonization of the energy system could be delayed. Long-run gains in specialization and efficiency will require global supply chains; the historical experience of the WTO Information Technology Agreement suggests a way forward for heliopolitical restabilization, so as to ensure future liberalization and growth in the sector.

J	Murphy, S				Murphy, Sara			Modernizing the US electric grid: A proposal to update transmission infrastructure for the future of electricity	ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY			English	Article								Electric transmission infrastructure is often undervalued in the United States. However, a recent surge of electrical blackouts due to extreme weather conditions and natural disasters has brought the United States' aging transmission infrastructure to the spotlight. Recent cyberattacks on critical energy infrastructure have also brought attention to the vulnerabilities in the U.S. electric infrastructure. Advancements such as the growth of electrification in the transportation sector and the integration of variable renewable energy critical to the decarbonization of the energy sector, further challenge the capacity of current electrical infrastructure. Addressing deficiencies within U.S. electric infrastructure requires the collaboration of many stakeholders including federal agencies, state governments, local communities, and electricity generation and distribution entities. To properly undertake the challenges to the United States transmission infrastructure, it is recommended that potential solutions are accurately modeled, that the FERC uses its rulemaking capacity to foster collaboration, and that the federal government creates a national transmission loan program to specifically fund nationally significant transmission projects.

Using the municipal jurisdiction of Vancouver, Canada as a case study, we integrated an energy-economy model with an urban land-use and infrastructure model to test the possible actions resulting from policies potentially available to this city government in pursuit of its 2050 target of 100 percent renewable energy and an 80 percent reduction of GHG emissions. We found that, while cities like the one we studied have some important options for reducing energy use by their inhabitants, they may lack the authority to completely transform the energy system, especially for causing a wholesale switch to renewable energy for deep decarbonization. To achieve such ambitious energy and GHG targets, cities with jurisdictional powers comparable to the city we studied are dependent to some degree on complementary GHG and energy policies from senior levels of government.

Several studies have projected a boom in new coal power generation in Africa, more than 30 GW (GW) of new capacity operational by 2030. Such a scenario has been used to justify proposed prohibitions on all new fossil fuel projects, including gas for cooking, power, fertilizer, or industry. We examined two of the most influential studies projecting steep increases in African coal and we independently collected and analyzed government and media reports on each of the 22 potential projects listed in a widely-used public database. Based on this analysis, we find the 'likely' greenfield coal capacity to come online by 2030 to be just one project of less than 1 GW. We find another 12 projects exist on paper but remain at an early stage of development or are showing minimal progress, suggesting they are unlikely to be online by 2030, if ever. Even counting these additional projects, the potential maximum is about 7 GW. In sum, Africa is not on the cusp of a coal boom and thus fears of one should not be used to justify blanket fossil finance bans.

Following the Presidential Regulation on the Acceleration Program for battery-based EV for Road Transportation in 2019, the Indonesian government provides incentives for the domestic production of EVs. However, as EV technology is relatively new for the domestic automotive industry in Indonesia, it needs to go through stages of development to achieve full readiness in society. This study analyses the key stakeholders' perceptions of EV industries using the Japanese technology readiness assessment (J-TRA) to better understand the current readiness level of EVs in Indonesia. Primary data are collected through interviews with an EV start-up company, experts in the EV field, government officials in charge of the national EV projects, and EV end-users. Extensive literature related to success stories of EV adoption in other countries was conducted as the basis for this study. The results showed that key stakeholders agree that EV technology has reached a high readiness level in technology development. Most of the stakeholders voted that the readiness bottleneck is commercialization, safety, and integration parameters. Furthermore, an elaborate policy recommendation gathered from both literature reviews and interviews with related stakeholders is presented.

J	Beck, L				Beck, Lee			Carbon capture and storage in the USA: the role of US innovation leadership in climate-technology commercialization	CLEAN ENERGY			English	Review						carbon capture; CCUS; nergy and environment; nergy system and policy; fossil energy; hydrogen and fuel cell		To limit global warming and mitigate climate change, the global economy needs to decarbonize and reduce emissions to net-zero by mid-century. The asymmetries of the global energy system necessitate the deployment of a suite of decarbonization technologies and an all-of-the-above approach to deliver the steep CO2-emissions reductions necessary. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies that capture CO2 from industrial and power-plant point sources as well as the ambient air and store them underground are largely seen as needed to address both the flow of emissions being released and the stock of CO2 already in the atmosphere. Despite the pressing need to commercialize the technologies, their large-scale deployment has been slow. Initial deployment, however, could lead to near-term cost reduction and technology proliferation, and lowering of the overall system cost of decarbonization. As of November 2019, more than half of global large-scale CCS facilities are in the USA, thanks to a history of sustained government support for the technologies. Recently, the USA has seen a raft of new developments on the policy and project side signaling a reinvigorated push to commercialize the technology. Analysing these recent developments using a policy-priorities framework for CCS commercialization developed by the Global CCS Institute, the paper assesses the USA's position to lead large-scale deployment of CCS technologies to commercialization. It concludes that the USA is in a prime position due to the political economic characteristics of its energy economy, resource wealth and innovation-driven manufacturing sector. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies are expected to be needed to mitigate climate change to reduce both the flow and the stock of CO2. The US is a leader in CCS, and new incentive mechanisms coupled with sustained government support provide a promising outlook for innovation leadership and large-scale CCS deployment.

The context of the COVID 19 pandemic, which caused high morbidity among miners, popularised the challenge of energy transition in Poland, where energy continues to be largely based on coal. The authors defend the thesis that the main lines of conflict regarding the demand to move away from coal are political and ideological at the level of public opinion. The advocates of the coal status quo are supporters of the right-wing populist Law and Justice (PiS) and Confederation (Konfederacja) parties. Left-wing and liberal groups are most conducive to energy transition and ecological demands. Residents of large cities, as well as better educated and less religious people are more open to energy transition. Despite the divisions regarding the date of abandoning coal in Poland, there is social agreement that the government should financially support the activities transforming Upper Silesia into a region producing clean energy.

J	Galvin, R				Galvin, Ray			Yes, there is enough money to decarbonize the economies of high-income countries justly and sustainably	ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Decarbonizing the economy; Quantitative easing; Central banks; Coronavirus recovery plans; Money creation	TRANSITION; GROWTH; POLICY	This year a number of factors have converged to substantially increase the impetus for a credible, effective programme to radically decarbonize the economies of high-income countries, particularly in the EU but also more broadly, in ways that would reduce economic inequality and are just and sustainable. These include the European Commission's European Green Deal, Coronavirus Recovery Plan and revamped Hydrogen Strategy; international calls for a green, sustainable and just coronavirus recovery; a global revival of Keynesian supplyside economics; and increasing interest in direct central bank funding of government stimulus programmes. In this essay I offer a first attempt to draw these elements together to suggest what might be a coherent strategy for action, at least for countries with stable, resilient currencies. One of the key elements would be for central banks to finance their governments' decarbonization programmes directly by buying government bonds and holding them in perpetuity as insurance against misallocation of funds. The losers in such a strategy would be elements in the finance sector which have come to rely on virtually free bailouts and handouts from central banks via quantitative easing programmes. Resistance to the proposed strategy would probably be fierce from these quarters.

Potential for Biomethanisation of CO2 from Anaerobic Digestion of Organic Wastes in the United Kingdom	PROCESSES			English	Article						in-situ biomethanisation; power-to-gas; anaerobic digestion; biomethane production; United Kingdom policy; energy security	BIOGAS UPGRADING PROCESS; IN-SITU; CARBON-DIOXIDE; PROCESS PERFORMANCE; SEWAGE-SLUDGE; FOOD WASTE; HYDROGEN; BIOMETHANATION; H-2; REACTOR	The United Kingdom (UK) has a decarbonisation strategy that includes energy from both hydrogen and biomethane. The latter comes from the growing anaerobic digestion (AD) market, which in 2020 produced 23.3 TWh of energy in the form of biogas. According to the strategy, this must be upgraded to biomethane by removal of carbon dioxide (CO2): a goal that could also be fulfilled through CO2 biomethanisation, alleviating the need for carbon capture and storage. Results are presented from a survey of publicly available datasets coupled with modelling to identify potential scale and knowledge gaps. Literature data were used to estimate maximum biomethane concentrations by feedstock type: these ranged from 79% for food wastes to 93% for livestock manures. Data from various government sources were used to estimate the overall potential for CO2 biomethanisation with current AD infrastructure. Values for the uplift in biomethane production ranged from 57% to 61%, but the need for more consistent data collection methodologies was highlighted. On average, however, if CO2 biomethanisation was applied in all currently operating UK AD plants an energy production uplift of 12,954 GWh could be achieved based on 2020 figures. This is sufficient to justify the inclusion of CO2 biomethanisation in decarbonisation strategies, in the UK and worldwide.

In this context, EU member states are required to develop a national strategy to achieve the required emissions reductions under the Paris Agreement and EU climate goals. Western Macedonia is a region in North-western Greece with its economy largely dominated by lignite mining, lignite-fired power plants and district heating systems. In 2019, the Greek Government set the goal of withdrawing all lignite plants by 2028, with most units being withdrawn already by 2023. This decision has had an immense socio-economic impact on the region of Western Macedonia. This research work reflects the current situation at the socio-economic and socio-political level in Western Macedonia and discusses the policies implemented in the context of the lignite phase-out process to ensure a just transition for households and businesses of the region. Although there is not a 'one-size-fits-all' blueprint for successful low-carbon transitions of high-carbon intensive regional economies, the main target of our paper is understanding the impacts, challenges and opportunities of decarbonizing Western Macedonia.

With the coinciding challenges of an alleged global 'populist wave,' and the growing visibility of a planetary climate crisis, this issue has gained relevance. While theoretical literature on the links between populism and climate action is growing, there is still little empirical evidence regarding the ways in which the thin ideology of populism can interact with climate policy in practice (particularly in the context of Eastern Europe). We look into this black box, by analyzing the Polish right-wing populist media discourses on energy and climate. Poland is widely perceived as a laggard in European climate policy and energy transition, seeking to safeguard domestic coal as a major energy source and opposing ambitious decarbonisation goals. At the same time, since 2015 it has seen a right-wing populist government in power, making it a very interesting case for an analysis of the interaction of populist politics and climate action. Using four key elements of populist political rhetoric as a framework (a populist episteme, Manichean good and evil connotations and internal enemies) we organize the arguments distilled from a wide reading of pro-governmental right-wing Polish media, to illustrate the content of populist climate and energy discourse, seeing some of the tropes found in our case as generalizable to other national contexts.

In Finland, district heating (DH) networks in most cities rely on carbon dioxide (CO2) intensive fuels such as coal and domestic peat. This study assesses the decarbonization of a Finnish city's DH by employing power to-heat (P2H) technologies, including heat pumps, an electric boiler, and thermal storage together with an ambitious building energy renovation program. This study also aims to use wind power with a calculated fixed price instead of the market price for the electricity consumption of the deployed P2H units to further support electrification and decarbonization of the DH network. Bilateral contract between the wind producer and the DH operator is examined, as new wind power producers receive no subsidies in Finland. The impacts of storage capacity, electricity tax, building-level renovation, and European CO2 & nbsp;emission allowance (EUA) price on the DH's optimal operation and break-even price of heat production were evaluated. The optimization routine minimizes marginal production costs. The optimal scenario eliminated the carbon intensive fuel peat with more affordable heat prices, due to P2H technologies, lower electricity tax, higher EUA prices, and the renovation of buildings. Bilateral electricity contract can bring mutual benefits for the DH company and the wind producer. (C)& nbsp;2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In recent years, to meet challenging emission target set by Government, power system in the UK has a rapid increase of integration with various-scale Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) and Energy Storage Systems (ESSs), which pushes the electricity market reform to accommodate the changes, encourage renewable energy integration, adopt new technologies, stimulate consumers participation, and ensure the power system resilience. The paper reviews the history of UK electricity market evolution, driving factors of reform, and the trend of current electricity market reform. In history, the UK electricity wholesale market has experienced three significant reform stages, which are introducing the Electricity Pool of England & Wales (the Pool) in the 1980s, implementing the New Electricity Trading Arrangements (NETA) in the 2000s, and performing the Electricity Market Reform (EMR) in 2013. To address the new emerging challenges in decarbonising power generation, the paper explains and analyses on-going electricity market changes and the trend for future electricity market reform.

This paper establishes a conceptual linkage between "sustainable development", "low-carbon energy transitions" and "energy justice" and examines social priorities to address peoples' competing priorities associated with low-carbon energy interventions. By analyzing a renewable energy project in Vietnam as a case study, the paper shows that linking social priorities to energy justice provides a useful contribution for energy policy makers toward a better understanding of the multidimensional and complex aspects of low-carbon energy transitions, and how different segments of society prioritize and perceive them for the achievement of socially just energy decisions.

Conse-quently, initiatives are being promoted to decrease the sector's emissions and comply with the Paris agreement. This article synthesizes the available information about heavy-duty fuel cell trucks as their deployment needs to be considered a complementary solution to decreasing CO2 emissions alongside battery electric vehicles. A thorough evaluation of 95 relevant documents determines that the main research topics in the past ten years converge on public policies, hydrogen supply chain, environmental impact, drivetrain technology, fuel cell, and storage tank applications. The identified research gaps relate to expanding collaboration between institutions and governments in developing joint green macro policies focused on hydrogen heavy-duty trucks, scarce research about hydrogen production energy sources, low interest in documenting hydrogen pilot projects, and minimal involvement of logistic companies, which need to plan their diesel freight's conversion as soon as possible.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

This study estimates the GHG emission reductions that will be achieved by the first stage of Canberra's light rail network, which will commence operation in 2019. Compared to a business-as-usual case (no light rail), emissions will be reduced by 18-30% along the first stage corridor, depending on the size of the modal shift from private passenger vehicles to the light rail. Each Canberran who shifts from a motorcar to the light rail will essentially reduce their emissions for the journey by 100%. The decarbonisation of the journey comes from the sourcing by 2020 of 90% of Canberra's electricity, which will power the light rail system, from renewable sources and the requirement by the ACT Government that the light rail system source the remaining 10% of its electricity from renewable sources.

J	Yazar, M				Yazar, Mahir			Norm domestication challenges for local climate actions: A lesson from Arizona, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND GOVERNANCE			English	Article; Early Access						Arizona; local climate governance; multi-level governance; norm domestication; Phoenix	POLICY ENTREPRENEURS; GOVERNANCE; CITIES; TRANSITIONS; DYNAMICS; PHOENIX; SUSTAINABILITY; LOCALIZATION; POLITICS; PORTLAND	Research on norm domestication in multi-level governance structures is overlooked in urban climate governance and policy literature. This paper conceptualizes multi-scalar interactions of norm domestication for local climate actions. The city of Phoenix, which operates under the "purple" (blue cities and red legislatures) state of Arizona, is analyzed to illustrate how a local government can take up the climate actions left in the void at the state and federal levels. The empirical findings reveal important temporal politics at the state level that influenced the local government's climate norm domestication. The period of Democratic party leadership diffused climate norms at the state-level and positioned the local government more as a climate policy-taker, adopting decisions from the state legislature. Swings in the state-level executive orders under the subsequent period of Republican leadership, however, forced the local government to seek some common ground for norm domestication, usually related to the nonpartisan goals of economic development. Consequently, local climate actions are subject to depoliticization of climate change from the higher-level governance structures. Overall, decarbonization targets are not being directed in ways that lead to a broader shift in the socio-technical system but would support short-term emission reductions if multiple institutions, both at the state and sub-state levels, created spaces for collaboration rather than competition.

A tale of two cities: Comparison of impacts on CO2 emissions, the indoor environment and health of home energy efficiency strategies in London and Milton Keynes	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Built environment; Housing; Energy efficiency; CO2 reduction; Indoor air quality; Health impacts	LONG-TERM EXPOSURE; LUNG-CANCER; PARTICLES; RADON; TEMPERATURES; MORTALITY; DWELLINGS; POLICIES; QUALITY; FINE	Dwellings are a substantial source of global CO2 emissions. The energy used in homes for heating, cooking and running electrical appliances is responsible for a quarter of current total UK emissions and is a key target of government policies for greenhouse gas abatement. Policymakers need to understand the potential impact that such decarbonization policies have-on the indoor environment and health for a full assessment of costs and benefits. We investigated these impacts in two contrasting settings of the UK: London, a predominantly older city and Milton Keynes, a growing new town. We employed SCRIBE, a building physics-based health impact model of the UK housing stock linked to the English Housing Survey, to examine changes, 2010-2050, in end-use energy demand, CO2 emissions, winter indoor temperatures, airborne pollutant concentrations and associated health impacts. For each location we modelled the existing (2010) housing stock and three future scenarios with different levels of energy efficiency interventions combined with either a business-as-usual, or accelerated decarbonization of the electricity grid approach. The potential for CO2 savings was appreciably greater in London than Milton Keynes except when substantial decarbonization of the electricity grid was assumed, largely because of the lower level of current energy efficiency in London and differences in the type and form of the housing stock. The average net impact on health per thousand population was greater in magnitude under all scenarios in London compared to Milton Keynes and more beneficial when it was assumed that purpose-provided ventilation (PPV) would be part of energy efficiency interventions, but more detrimental when interventions were assumed not to include PPV. These findings illustrate the importance of considering ventilation measures for health protection and the potential variation in the impact of home energy efficiency strategies, suggesting the need for tailored policy approaches in different locations, rather than adopting a universally rolled out strategy.

J	Kelly, MJ				Kelly, M. J.			Lessons from technology development for energy and sustainability	MRS ENERGY & SUSTAINABILITY			English	Review						energy generation; environment; government policy and funding; environmentally benign		There are lessons from recent history of technology introductions which should not be forgotten when considering alternative energy technologies for carbon dioxide emission reductions. The growth of the ecological footprint of a human population about to increase from 7B now to 9B in 2050 raises serious concerns about how to live both more efficiently and with less permanent impacts on the finite world. One present focus is the future of our climate, where the level of concern has prompted actions across the world in mitigation of the emissions of CO2. An examination of successful and failed introductions of technology over the last 200 years generates several lessons that should be kept in mind as we proceed to 80% decarbonize the world economy by 2050. I will argue that all the actions taken together until now to reduce our emissions of carbon dioxide will not achieve a serious reduction, and in some cases, they will actually make matters worse. In practice, the scale and the different specific engineering challenges of the decarbonization project are without precedent in human history. This means that any new technology introductions need to be able to meet the huge implied capabilities. An altogether more sophisticated public debate is urgently needed on appropriate actions that (i) considers the full range of threats to humanity, and (ii) weighs more carefully both the upsides and downsides of taking any action, and of not taking that action.

For this reason, governments are promoting the use of Renewable Energy Sources (RES), especially wind and solar. In order to increase the penetration of RES, whose energy production cannot be controlled to follow the demand, more and more energy storage systems are needed, for ensuring adequacy and security to electrical power systems. This paper is focused on an innovative thermal energy storage technology based on fluidized solid particles, capable of receiving energy as electricity and storing it as heat for later use, e.g. produce steam for industrial applications. In such a system, electric energy is converted to heat by means of resistors, that can be supplied with AC and/or DC sources. In the paper, different use-case scenarios are presented, involving the grid and/or a photovoltaic plant as electric power sources.

This global push for decarbonisation in transport is mirrored in the United Kingdoms policies with plans to discontinue the sale of new internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles by 2040. Nevertheless, while the EV industry has made significant gains in the car market, ICE vehicles remain the most predominant mode of transport for consumers. The transition from ICE to EV vehicles is a subject of major interest in industry, government and academic circles due to the numerous economic, social and technical challenges. In particular, the market aspects of this transition and consumer purchase behaviour when exposed to EVs require an in-depth understanding. This paper explores the decision making processes by consumers under various market scenarios when comparing ICE and EV vehicles currently available in the UK market. The contribution of this paper is a discrete choice experimental model that highlights the socioeconomic and technical aspects influencing consumer confidence in making the transition from ICE to EVs.

J	Coulter, S				Coulter, Steve			Industrial Policies or Industrial Strategy: The Difficulty of Enacting Long-Term Supply-Side Reform in the UK	POLITICAL QUARTERLY			English	Article						industrial strategy; economic policy; varieties of capitalism; growth models		The government's recent ditching of Theresa May's interventionist 'Industrial Strategy' and its replacement with the more amorphous and target-driven 'Plan for Growth' has dismayed many in industry. But in many ways, the move merely exemplifies the ad hoc, short-termist and ideologically driven nature of how industrial strategy has often been conceived and implemented in the UK since its rediscovery as an important tool of supply-side policy following the market-fundamentalist Thatcherite interregnum. This short-termism has sabotaged repeated attempts to move the UK economy onto a higher and more sustainable growth path and will likely hinder the government in meeting its objectives on productivity, decarbonisation and levelling up through reindustrialisation. The problem has both institutional and ideological causes, largely to do with Treasury domination of the supply-side agenda and its default market failure approach. This hinders successful adoption of the kinds of expansive, 'mission-oriented' industrial strategies followed more successfully in other countries and which could be transformative if applied in the UK.

The new federal government of Germany emphasises that future investments must be measured by how climate- and environmentally-friendly they are. This applies to all areas of the economy and society- especially the transport sector. The federal and state governments agree that, in addition to a pure change in propulsion -towards electromobility on rail and road - a change in mobility is also needed, with a significantly stronger rail system, especially in areas where public transport has not yet been strong enough. In some places, efficient public transport also requires new underground, light rail and tram lines, additional tracks, longer platforms, etc. - and thus also new rail structures such as bridges, tunnels, etc. The basic principle here must be that transport structures must be built in such a way that they can be used efficiently. The basic principle must be that transport structures are built as efficiently and emission-free as possible, but are not prevented from being built by escalating costs. An almost emission-free construction method can be expected in the long term. The decisive factor is that relevant amounts of CO2 are saved every year.

A Real Portuguese Case Study	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						biomethane; natural gas grid; bioenergy; biogas; gas supply decarbonization; incentives	LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; SEWAGE-SLUDGE; TECHNOECONOMIC ASSESSMENT; ANAEROBIC-DIGESTION; ENERGY RECOVERY; BIOGAS; GAS; TECHNOLOGIES; SYSTEM; SECTOR	Wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) located in regions far from a high-pressure grid can produce renewable biomethane, which can partially substitute the natural gas locally consumed. However, the economic viability of implementing biomethane plants in WWTP has to be guaranteed. This paper uses the discount cash flow method to analyze the economic viability of producing biomethane in a WWTP located in evora (Portugal). The results show that, under the current conditions, it is unprofitable to produce biomethane in this WWTP. Since selling the CO2 separated from biogas may result in an additional income, this option was also considered. In this case, a price of 46 EUR/t CO2 has to be paid to make the project viable. Finally, the impact of potential government incentives in the form of feed-in premia was investigated. Without selling CO2, the project would only be profitable for feed-in premia above 55.5 EUR/MWh. If all the CO2 produced was sold at 30 EUR/t CO2, a premium price of 20 EUR/MWh would make the project profitable. This study shows that the economic attractiveness of producing biomethane in small WWTP is only secured through sufficient financial incentives, which are vital for developing the biomethane market with all its associated advantages.

Empirically, it examines Germany's coal exit plan, the world's largest in terms of power capacity. By putting theories of capital devaluation into conversation with regulation theory, this study reveals the continuities between Germany's exit plan and its long tradition of delaying the devaluation of coal. This paper engages with relational political-economic approaches to analyse the German coal exit plan beyond the dualistic market vs policy-based interpretation, which has been promoted by the coal industry to capture compensation payments. Rather, it will be argued that this plan, which in its current form is based on generous financial compensations to coal companies, can be understood as a way to regulate the ongoing devaluation affecting the energy industry and manage a dual legitimation crisis affecting the federal government.

J	Keay, M				Keay, Malcolm			UK energy policy - Stuck in ideological limbo?	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Energy policy; UK; Electricity; Gas; Governance; Energy efficiency		Energy policy in the UK has undergone a paradigm change over recent decades from the free market stance of the 1990s to the more interventionist measures of the 21st century. However, the two approaches have not been reconciled - even as the Government intervenes, it reaffirms its goal of creating more competitive markets. The contradictions are most apparent with electricity, which has been the main focus of intervention to date, in line with decarbonisation strategy. Investment is dependent on Government support, which changes in response to circumstances, creating uncertainty and undermining the basis of market operation - so leading to the need for more intervention. The future for other sources - natural gas, nuclear power and carbon capture and storage in particular remains unclear. The Government risks getting the worst of both worlds - without the coordination and direction which could come from a centralised approach or the efficiencies and innovation which might emerge from a more consistent market based policy. Unless a fuller policy statement, expected later this year, can clarify matters, UK energy policy will not be fit for purpose and will fail to meet its key goals, of economic effectiveness, environmental protection and energy security.

The research examines the influence of installer businesses on rates of uptake and standards of installation, and the interplay between business practices and the policy environment. The research developed new detailed datasets through a nationwide survey, to which 388 installers responded, and follow-up interviews with 22 installers. Focusing on solar photovoltaics and air source heat pumps installed in households, the results show the fundamental dependence of installer businesses on government financial incentives and on the quality assurance scheme in operation. Market confidence was compromised by the sharp reduction in the Feed-In Tariff (FIT) for residential solar PV in 2012 and long delays to the equivalent Renewable Heat Incentive for residential installations. Nevertheless, more modest FIT levels have reduced the risk of sub-optimal installations and inappropriate specification of microgeneration systems. The findings underline the need for consistent policy to allow installer businesses and their supply chains to develop and mature, and thus facilitate commercial deployment of microgeneration of high quality, raise its competiveness with incumbent forms of energy supply and contribute to decarbonisation goals.

Evaluating Low-Carbon Transportation Technologies When Demand Responds to Price	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						technology evaluation; carbon intensity; rebound effect; climate change mitigation	ENERGY EFFICIENCY; FUEL EFFICIENCY; VEHICLE-TRAVEL; SHORT-RUN; GASOLINE; CLIMATE; CONSUMPTION; MITIGATION; ELASTICITIES	The carbon intensity (CI) of travel is commonly used to evaluate transportation technologies. However, when travel demand is sensitive to price, CI alone does not fully capture the emissions impact of a technology. Here, we develop a metric to account for both CI and the demand response to price (DR) in technology evaluation, for use by distributed decision-makers in industry and government, who are becoming increasingly involved in climate change mitigation as the costs of lower-carbon technologies fall. We apply this adjusted carbon intensity (ACI) to evaluate ethanol-fueled, hybrid, and battery electric vehicles individually and against policy targets. We find that all of these technologies can be used to help meet a 2030 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of up to 40% below 2005 levels and that decarbonized battery electric vehicles can meet a 2050 target of 80%, even when evaluated using the ACI instead of CI. Using the CI alone could lead to a substantial overshoot of emissions targets especially in markets with significant DR, including in rapidly growing economies with latent travel demand. The ACI can be used to adjust decarbonization transition plans to mitigate this risk. For example, in examining several transportation technologies, we find that accelerating low-carbon technology transitions by roughly 5-10 years would mitigate the risk associated with DR estimates. One particularly robust strategy is to remove carbon from fuels through faster decarbonization of electricity and vehicle electrification.

However, there has been little empirical research on how the scope of citizens' assemblies affects the internal logic of the assembly process and its impacts on external policy actors. This is a significant oversight given the power of agenda setting. It is also of particular importance for climate assemblies given the exceptional scale and complexity of climate change, as well as the need for co-ordination across all policy areas and types of governance to address it. In this paper, we start to address this gap through an in-depth case analysis of the Climate Assembly UK. We adopt a mixed methods approach, combining surveys of the assembly members and witnesses, interviews with the assembly members, organisers, MPs, parliamentary staff, and government civil servants, and non-participant observation of the process. We find that attempts to adapt the assembly's scope to the scale of the climate change issue compromised assembly member learning, the co-ordination of the resulting recommendations, assembly member endorsement of the recommendations, and the extent of their impact on parliament and government. We argue that more democratization in setting the agenda could help combat these issues.

The tensions between continuing short-term economic growth whilst investing in low-carbon technologies for long-term decarbonisation could be eased if there were significant financial and non-climate potential benefits of decarbonisation for these economies. This study explores some of the potential benefits for India, by analysing its long-term mitigation options in the context of global action towards a 2 degrees C target, using an energy systems model (The University College London TIMES Integrated Assessment Model, or TIAM-UCL) which represents India explicitly, as one of 16 global regions. The study finds that India could significantly over-achieve against a 2050 low-carbon target based on equal per capita emissions by 2050, at mitigation costs below the global carbon price, implying that it could earn significant revenues through selling international carbon credits, thereby offsetting some of the costs of decarbonisation. In addition, India would see much lower levels of fossil fuel consumption in a low-carbon scenario, thereby alleviating potential economic difficulties in securing access to adequate supplies of these fuels.

J	Umoh, K; Lemon, M				Umoh, Kubiat; Lemon, Mark			Drivers for and Barriers to the Take up of Floating Offshore Wind Technology: A Comparison of Scotland and South Africa	ENERGIES			English	Article						offshore wind; floating offshore wind energy; decarbonisation; global energy transition; whole systems approach		Offshore wind could both play a significant role in decarbonising the global energy system and supporting the energy needs of cities. Recent trends in offshore wind have seen the installation of turbines in deeper and more remote waters due to the presence of stronger and more consistent wind resources. This has led to the development of floating foundations for turbine mounting in water depths above 40 m, where conventional bottom-fixed foundations are not considered economically feasible. However, due to its emerging nature, floating wind must attain market maturity to be considered cost competitive. It is a widely accepted belief that market expansion yields technological maturity. Therefore, this paper adopts a systems approach to investigate the viability of floating offshore wind power generation in Scotland and South Africa. It does this through a content analysis of relevant secondary documentation, including policy documents, industry reports, press releases, online publications, and databases to determine the drivers and barriers of floating wind in the case contexts. The key findings are that substantial technical potential is required to attract floating wind investments, political support is necessary in order to scale up, a strong offshore wind supply chain could cushion the high-cost effects of floating wind projects, and more innovative business models such as corporate Power Purchasing Agreements could serve as social drivers for such projects. The main contextual conclusions drawn from this paper are that Scotland's inaugural floating wind projects benefitted from the Scottish government's Renewable Obligation scheme, however its discontinuation threatens the prospects of future projects. Alternatively, South Africa's technical potential, coupled with its government's healthy appetite for renewable energy development, could see the take up of this technology in the near future, with corresponding benefits for more sustainable energy in densely populated areas, compliant with SDG 7.

However, the debate over whether EVs are lower carbon than traditional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) has never stopped. To objectively evaluate the role of EVs in mitigating climate change and carbon emissions, this study provides an extensive review of the literature on the life cycle carbon footprint of various EVs, and compares the carbon emissions of EVs and ICEVs. Considering that the carbon emissions of EVs vary significantly geographically due to differences in the power mix, ambient tem-perature, and driving conditions, this review further compares the carbon emission reduction effects of deploying EVs in different countries. The results show that the life cycle carbon footprint of EVs is lower than that of ICEVs, despite the higher carbon emissions from battery production. According to the power generation situation of each country, countries dominated by renewable energy power generation are more suitable for adopting EVs, while in countries with a predominantly coal-fired power generation, the popularization of EVs should be accompanied by a focus on decarbonization of the electricity sector and infrastructure improvements. Overall, improving the production technology of EVs and increasing the proportion of clean energy generation will be helpful to achieve the decarbonization goal in the transportation sector.

The perspectives of key UK energy system stakeholders have been to develop three socio-technical narratives of energy system change that are quantified in a 24-techno-economic model of the country. Implementing these three narratives in the model allows their feasibility for meeting climate targets to be assessed as well as articulating implied sub-national regional outlooks for technologies and investment. The latter elements are in light of the regional socioeconomic and demographic landscape. The study highlights some the regional political dimensions associated with future investment targeting in the UK energy system. particular, energy policy decisions may create tensions between the four different UK government as well as raising important questions about regional economic development and how equitable energy transition can be achieved for all.

Hence, decarbonization of the transport sector by employing electric vehicles (EVs) is currently an environmentally benign and efficient solution. The EV includes the hybrid EV (HEV), the plug-in hybrid EV (PHEV), and the battery EV (BEV). A storage system, a charging station, and power electronics are the essential components of EVs. The EV charging station is primarily powered from the grid which can be replaced by a solar photovoltaic system. Wide uptake of EVs is possible by improving the technologies, and also with support from the government. However, greenhouse gas emission (GHG) saving potential of the EV is debatable when the required power to charge the EV comes from traditional fossil fuel sources.

Furthermore, public research investment in this area is less than in other sectors despite significant investment in construction and infrastructure generally. This is also at a time of rapid change driven by population growth, resource scarcity and security, developments in technology, society's expectations and aspirations, and climate. A major review of the purpose of infrastructure and construction was thus undertaken by representatives from academia, industry, research organisations, clients and government. They concluded that, if transformational research is to take place, the research themes to address are hazards, understanding material behaviour, paradigm shift in design, construction processes, building performance, smart buildings, asset management, intervention, decarbonisation and adaption.

J	Sharpe, S; Lenton, TM				Sharpe, Simon; Lenton, Timothy M.			Upward-scaling tipping cascades to meet climate goals: plausible grounds for hope	CLIMATE POLICY			English	Article						Climate policy; tipping points; technology transitions; diplomacy		Limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees C requires a dramatic acceleration of decarbonization to reduce net anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions to zero around mid-century. In complex systems - including human societies - tipping points can occur, in which a small perturbation transforms a system. Crucially, activating one tipping point can increase the likelihood of triggering another at a larger scale, and so on. Here, we show how such upward-scaling tipping cascades could accelerate progress in tackling climate change. We focus on two sectors - light road transport and power - where tipping points have already been triggered by policy interventions at individual nation scales. We show how positive-sum cooperation, between small coalitions of jurisdictions and their policymakers, could lead to global changes in the economy and emissions. The aim of activating tipping points and tipping cascades is a particular application of systems thinking. It represents a different starting point for policy to the theory of welfare economics, one that can be useful when the priority is to achieve dynamic rather than allocative efficiency. Key policy insights Pricing policies and targeted investments that bring clean technologies below the threshold of cost-parity with fossil fuel technologies can trigger reinforcing feedbacks that cascade up scales to propel disproportionately rapid decarbonization. Traditional approaches to climate policy based on welfare economics principles of minimizing marginal abatement costs, and pricing externalities, are likely to miss these opportunities. Systems thinking can help identify ways for policy to drive effective change. Positive-sum cooperation between small groups of countries can accelerate the activation of tipping points in the global economy, facilitating decarbonization in all countries. Early opportunities for this are in the power and light road transport sectors, where clean technologies are increasingly competitive with fossil fuels. The value of decarbonization policies should be judged not just on their immediate effects on emissions within the implementing jurisdiction, but also for their potential to contribute to upward-scaling tipping cascades in the global economy.

J	Matthes, FC				Matthes, Felix Chr			Exit economics: The relatively low cost of Germany's nuclear phase-out	BULLETIN OF THE ATOMIC SCIENTISTS			English	Article						decarbonization; electricity market; electricity policy; Germany; nuclear energy; nuclear policy		The decision of the German government, post-Fukushima, to phase out the country's nuclear power sector by 2022 builds on legislation in place since 2002. This earlier legislation was amended in 2010 to extend the lifetime of the nuclear plants, but the German parliament reversed this extension in the summer of 2011, slightly accelerating the original phase-out schedule; therefore, the market and the nuclear operators were prepared for the shutdown schedule. In this context, it is not surprising that the observed price impacts from the shutdown of 40 percent of the German nuclear power capacity in 2011 are smaller than some modeling exercises had projected. When empirical observation is analyzed in light of a range of economic models, the price effect of the nuclear phase-out can be expected to peak at 5 euros per megawatt-hour or less for a few years around 2020, a reasonably small increase compared with the uncertainties created by other fundamental determinants of Europe's electricity prices. The macroeconomic effects attributable to the complete shutdown of nuclear power also appear likely to be relatively small, peaking at perhaps 0.3 percent of gross domestic product or less a few years before 2030. In the end, the management of the German transition to an energy mix dominated by renewable energies-and not the use of the existing nuclear reactor fleet for a decade more or less-will be the key determinant of whether that shift has larger or smaller effects on electricity prices or on the German economy overall.

However, increasing climate change impacts necessitate these buildings to be sustainable, resilient, and zero CO2 emissions. By producing five scenarios (plus existing buildings) with constant floor areas, we investigated how buildings and district forms with building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) affect energy consumption and production, self-sufficiency, CO2 emission, and energy costs in the context of waterfront redevelopment in Tokyo. From estimated hourly electricity demands of the buildings, techno-economic analyses were conducted for rooftop PV systems for 2018 and 2030 with declining costs of rooftop PV systems. We found that environmental building designs with rooftop PV system are increasingly economical in Tokyo with CO2 emission reduction of 2-9% that depends on rooftop sizes. Payback periods drop from 14 years in 2018 to 6 years in 2030. Toward net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050, immediate actions are necessary to install rooftop PVs on existing and new buildings with energy efficiency improvements by construction industry and building owners. To facilitate such actions, national and local governments need to adopt appropriate policies.

Historically most incremental energy demand has been met through fossil fuels; however, in future that energy will have to be low carbon and ultimately zero-carbon. Decarbonization can and needs to happen at varying speeds in all countries, depending on national circumstances. This article reviews the implications of a transition to low-carbon energy on economic growth and development in current low-income countries. It sets out empirical findings about trajectories for energy intensity and emissions intensity of economic growth; explores pathways to accelerate decarbonization; reviews the theoretical and empirical literature on economic costs and co-benefits of energy decarbonization; and assesses analytical approaches. It discusses the opportunities that might arise in terms of a cleaner, more dynamic and more sustainable growth model, and the options for developing countries to implement a less-carbon intensive model of economic development.

The political economy of fossil fuel reform, energy dependence and climate policy in Haiti	ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Fuel subsidies; Climate policy; Energy justice; Haiti; Sustainable development; Socio-ecological crisis	DECISION-MAKING; JUSTICE; POVERTY; CAPABILITIES; NATIONALISM; SUBSIDIES; FUTURES	The uneven effects of the climate crisis and the need for decarbonization by reducing fossil fuel exploitation and eliminating subsidies create critical trade-offs and tensions for low-income developing countries. Recent reform of fuel consumption subsidies has shown a perennial mitigation bias largely imposed by external forces, in particular multilateral agencies and foreign governments in the context of the Paris accord. Contradictorily, external pressures to reduce subsidies have created competitive markets for multinationals to have a disproportionate role in supplying energy products which foreground the inequities in Haitian society that have spurred social and political resistance. Empirical work on energy-subsidy reform and climate policy do not sufficiently interrogate the interplay and implications of underlying assumptions, power imbalances between domestic and foreign actors, the challenging infrastructural and political context of renewable energy promotion, and immediate concerns to address worsening social conditions and development priorities. Drawing upon these policy debates, this paper considers the recent experience of Haiti to reform its energy subsidies required by the International Monetary Fund to enforce austerity. The paper takes a more integrated and critical approach to these policy discussions in a context of interconnecting political and socio-ecological crises and climate policy in Haiti. By inductively analyzing Haiti's main climate and energy policies and evidence drawn from field experience, the paper offers a more nuanced understanding of decarbonization and energy debates in this extremely vulnerable context. This approach gives priority to a more dynamic historical analysis of the sociopolitical context and factors that seek to advance climate justice.

Exploring the potential of hydrogen in decarbonizing China's light-duty vehicle market	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY			English	Article						Vehicle market penetration; Life-cycle analysis; Greenhouse gas emissions; Hydrogen; China	GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; SCENARIO ANALYSIS; DEMAND; FUTURE; SALES	The Chinese government has pledged to achieve overall carbon neutrality by 2060. Currently, the transportation sector contributes to about 10% of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in China. Hence, China has created a well-defined energy vehicle development strategy to reduce GHG emissions from the transportation sector, further expanding into hydrogen vehicle technologies. In this study, the Transportation Energy Analysis Model (TEAM) investigates the potential of hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicles (H2- ICEVs) and fuel cell vehicles (FCEVs) as a reliable pathway towards the government's aspiration of carbon neutrality in the transportation sector. According to TEAM, by adopting FCEVs and H2-ICEVs in the vehicle market, hydrogen demand could reach 25% of the total light-duty transportation energy demand in 2050. Consequently, this will lead to an annual reduction of more than 35 million tons GHG compared to only counting on the electrification pathway in the decarbonization task. Besides, FCEVs would take longer to penetrate the light-duty vehicle market compared to H2-ICEVs, as the current fuel cell technology still requires much improvement to attain a competitive vehicle cost of production.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

However, many scenarios assessing global decarbonization pathways, either based on integrated assessment models or partial-equilibrium models, fail to identify the key role that this technology could play, including far lower future PV capacity than that projected by the PV community. In this perspective, we review the factors that lie behind the historical cost reductions of solar PV and identify innovations in the pipeline that could contribute to maintaining a high learning rate. We also aim at opening a constructive discussion among PV experts, modelers, and policymakers regarding how to improve the representation of this technology in the models and how to ensure that manufacturing and installation of solar PV- can ramp up on time, which will be crucial to remain in a decarbonization path compatible with the Paris Agreement.

J	Li, KY; Acha, S; Sunny, N; Shah, NL				Li, Kaying; Acha, Salvador; Sunny, Nixon; Shah, Nilay			Strategic transport fleet analysis of heavy goods vehicle technology for net-zero targets	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Biomethane; Battery electric vehicles; Heavy goods vehicles; Hydrogen; Liquefied natural gas; PEST -SWOT models	ELECTRIC VEHICLES; ROAD FREIGHT; HYDROGEN; HYBRID; BATTERY; COST; UK	This paper addresses the decarbonisation of the heavy-duty transport sector and develops a strategy towards netzero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in heavy-goods vehicles (HGVs) by 2040. By conducting a literature review and a case study on the vehicle fleet of a large UK food and consumer goods retailer, the feasibilities of four alternative vehicle technologies are evaluated from environmental, economic, and technical perspectives. Sociopolitical factors and commercial readiness are also examined to capture non-technical criteria that influences decision-makers. Strategic analysis frameworks such as PEST-SWOT models were developed for liquefied natural gas, biomethane, electricity and hydrogen to allow a holistic comparison and identify their long-term deployment potential. Technology innovation is needed to address range and payload limitations of electric trucks, whereas government and industry support are essential for a material deployment of hydrogen in the 2030s. Given the UK government's plan to phase out new diesel HGVs by 2040, fleet operators should commence new vehicle trials by 2025 and replace a considerable amount of their lighter diesel trucks with zero-emission vehicles by 2030, and the remaining heavier truck fleet by 2035.

In particular, renewable energies as solar and wind pose benefits and challenges on traditional power system, e.g., they are environmentally friendly but their intermittency and seasonality is a challenge for security of supply. Though, this is not obstacle for countries to produce almost 100% of Is electricity from renewables, such is the case in Costa Rica, Paraguay and Iceland. In this context, and given multiple uncertainties tied to the spread of renewable energies, this paper uses a simulation model to analyse a scenario with 100% renewable energy supply. This paper concludes that for the Colombian case, a large hydroelectric component and Is complementarily with solar and wind reduce prices and increase energy efficiency, while helping security of supply.

This paper seeks to fill that gap by presenting a coherent account of how neoliberal ideology has constrained policies to address climate change in the United States. As motivation, we first present evidence suggesting more neoliberal countries perform worse in addressing climate change. We then analyze how three tenets of neoliberal ideology-to decentralize democracy, defund public investment, and deregulate the economy-have stymied climate action in the United States. Finally, we discuss the Green New Deal as a decisively anti-neoliberal framework that seeks to wield the power of the federal government to pursue large-scale public investments and binding climate regulations for rapid decarbonization.

Energy planning tools for low carbon transitions: an example of a multicriteria spatial planning tool for district heating	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						energy; strategic niche management; transitions; multicriteria tools; low carbon heat	PUBLIC-POLICY; INNOVATION; DIFFUSION; FRAMEWORK; MODELS	Energy planning tools can support transitions to low carbon energy by helping planners to identify technology options and scenarios. Exploring a case study of district heating development to support heat decarbonisation in the United Kingdom (UK), this article uses thematic analysis of qualitative semistructured interviews conducted between May 2013 and August 2015 with local and regional government officials, in order to consider how energy planning decision-making tools can be designed to support the early stages of low carbon transitions as a form of strategic niche management. The findings of this analysis are then tested through the development of a spatial heat planning tool covering England and Wales, designed to respond to the needs of niche actors seeking to facilitate early development of district heating projects. The tool is for use by local government actors as they seek to build social networks of stakeholders to support the technology change, to demonstrate its value and to support skills development. The research shows the importance of designing flexible tools which can go beyond techno-economic criteria and reflect the wider motivations and decision criteria of local actors, including social criteria.

Its application to date has however been mostly limited to the power sector, despite emissions from other industrial sectors accounting for around 30% of global anthropogenic CO(2)emissions. This paper explores the challenges of and requirements for implementing CCUS in non-power industrial sectors in general, and in the steel sector in particular, to identify drivers for the technology's commercialization. To do so we first conducted a comprehensive literature review of business models of existing large-scale CCUS projects. We then collected primary qualitative data through a survey questionnaire and semi-structured interviews with global CCUS experts from industry, academia, government, and consultancies. Our results reveal that the revenue model is the most critical element to building successful CCUS business models, around which the following elements are structured: funding sources, capital & ownership structure, and risk management/allocation. One promising mechanism to subsidize the additional costs associated with the introduction of CCUS to industry is the creation of a 'low-carbon product market', while the creation of clear risk-allocation systems along the full CCUS chain is particularly highlighted. The application of CCUS as an enabling emission reduction technology is further shown to be a factor of consumer and shareholder pressures, pressing environmental standards, ethical resourcing, resource efficiency, and first-mover advantages in an emerging market.

J	Arioli, M; Fulton, L; Lah, O				Arioli, Magdala; Fulton, Lew; Lah, Oliver			Transportation strategies for a 1.5 degrees C world: A comparison of four countries	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Climate change; Paris agreement; GHG emissions; Transport sector; Low-carbon scenarios		Decarbonizing transportation in emerging economies will be one of the key challenges in global climate change mitigation efforts. In this paper, pathways are developed towards achieving a 1.5 degrees degree scenario for land-transport for four emerging economies (Brazil, India, Kenya and Vietnam). The aim is to highlight the key opportunities and challenges for low-carbon transport in countries with rapidly growing mobility demand. The main focus of this paper is to reconcile actual and required emission reduction targets and develop plausible pathways to achieve these targets. The paper also identifies potential strategies and measures for these countries to follow these pathways. The analysis considers the contributions of "avoid" (cutting travel growth), "shift" (to lower CO2 modes) and "improve" (vehicle and fuel CO2 characteristics) interventions to decarbonisation scenarios. These scenarios aim to inform renewed Nationally Determined Contributions and shed light on the feasibility of deep decarbonisation pathways that would be in line with the Paris Agreement. Results from this study show that achieving 1.5DS would require dramatic changes in travel patterns, technology and fuels, and major intensification of current policy approaches. Decarbonization solutions will need to include greater use and investment of efficient modes, major shifts toward near-zero carbon fuels such as clean electricity, systems integration, modal shift and urban planning solutions. Although the socio-economic situations and national transport systems differ between the selected countries, some fairly similar strategies appear likely to be core to the mitigation effort, such as rapid growth in light- and heavy-duty vehicle electrification and investments in public transit systems.

However, public awareness, understanding and acceptance of the technology are required. At the same time, gamification has been identified as a viable teaching and learning method in higher education, which might be also appealing to non-professionals and might bridge their knowledge gap in DH. Since literature review has shown that no game about DH exists, the concept of a serious game about a heat supply system and its transformation from a fossil fuel-based system to a renewable-based one is introduced in this work. The first results of the game development are presented, namely, initial conditions, gameplay, the model of heating sector and the model of the DH transformation. The game will allow players to explore interdependencies between technical, economic, ecological and sociopolitical aspects as well as among different stakeholders (producers, consumers, government) and develop strategies for a successful transformation. The flexibility of different transformation scenarios and the influence of boundary conditions on the transformation can be analyzed after playing the game multiple times. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

Toward net-zero sustainable aviation fuel with wet waste-derived volatile fatty acids	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						biojet; food waste; decarbonization; ketonization	CARBOXYLIC-ACIDS; JET FUELS; HYDRODEOXYGENATION; KETONES; GAS; STRATEGIES; LUBRICANTS; EMISSIONS; CATALYSTS; RECOVERY	With the increasing demand for net-zero sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), new conversion technologies are needed to process waste feedstocks and meet carbon reduction and cost targets. Wet waste is a low-cost, prevalent feedstock with the energy potential to displace over 20% of US jet fuel consumption; however, its complexity and high moisture typically relegates its use to methane production from anaerobic digestion. To overcome this, methanogenesis can be arrested during fermentation to instead produce C-2 to C-8 volatile fatty acids (VFA) for catalytic upgrading to SAF. Here, we evaluate the catalytic conversion of food waste-derived VFAs to produce n-paraffin SAF for near-term use as a 10 vol% blend for ASTM "Fast Track" qualification and produce a highly branched, isoparaffin VFA-SAF to increase the renewable blend limit. VFA ketonization models assessed the carbon chain length distributions suitable for each VFA-SAF conversion pathway, and food waste-derived VFA ketonization was demonstrated for >100 h of time on stream at approximately theoretical yield. Fuel property blending models and experimental testing determined normal paraffin VFA-SAF meets 10 vol% fuel specifications for "Fast Track." Synergistic blending with isoparaffin VFA-SAF increased the blend limit to 70 vol% by addressing flashpoint and viscosity constraints, with sooting 34% lower than fossil jet. Techno-economic analysis evaluated the major catalytic process cost-drivers, determining the minimum fuel selling price as a function of VFA production costs. Life cycle analysis determined that if food waste is diverted from landfills to avoid methane emissions, VFA-SAF could enable up to 165% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions relative to fossil jet.

Performing a prospective life cycle assessment for two promising technologies in a series of climate change mitigation scenarios, we find that electricity sector decarbonization and DAC technology improvements are both indispensable to avoid environmental problem-shifting. Decarbonizing the electricity sector improves the sequestration efficiency, but also increases the terrestrial ecotoxicity and metal depletion levels per tonne of CO2 sequestered via DAC. These increases can be reduced by improvements in DAC material and energy use efficiencies. DAC exhibits regional environmental impact variations, highlighting the importance of smart siting related to energy system planning and integration. DAC deployment aids the achievement of long-term climate targets, its environmental and climate performance however depend on sectoral mitigation actions, and thus should not suggest a relaxation of sectoral decarbonization targets. New study concludes that environmental tradeoffs of direct air capture and sequestration technologies are linked to the energy system in which they will operate, and their deployment should not equate to a relaxation of decarbonization or resource use efficiency targets.

In 2015, however, this 24-year-old prohibition was lifted at one of two open pit mines under the ban and, as a consequence, some of its reserves of brown coal may be mined in future. We use the regional technology-rich energy system optimization model, TIMES, to analyse the impacts of maintaining the ban versus three options for less environmentally stringent mining policies - the policy adopted in 2015 and two additional policy propositions which would further lift the ban at the second open pit mine, which have not been rejected by the Czech government. We evaluate the effects of these four policy options on the Czech energy system, the costs of generating energy, air quality and greenhouse gas emissions, and related external environmental and health costs up to 2050. We find that none of the three new policy variants jeopardizes achievement of the 2030 carbon reduction targets. However, the 2050 80% carbon reduction target may not be achievable in any case - the projected reductions range between 66 and 71%, and only maintaining the 1991 ban could reduce this gap, whereas the two policies under discussion would mean that reaching this target would be even more challenging. The newly adopted 2015 policy will lead to at least 709 PJ more brown coal use and up to 85 Mt more greenhouse gases emissions by 2050. The additional supply of brown coal made available by lifting the limits will exceed domestic demand. Brown coal that will be burnt in domestic power plants will lead to additional external costs due to adverse impacts on the environment and human health of up to (sic)306 million.

Hydrogen Strategies of the Largest European Energy Companies	CONTEMPORARY EUROPE-SOVREMENNAYA EVROPA			Russian	Article						hydrogen energy; corporate strategies; grey; blue and green hydrogen; BP; Royal Dutch Shell; Total; EoN; EDF; RWE	STORAGE	The article outlines strategies of the largest European energy companies in the context of the EU climate policy aiming to accelerate the transition to a low carbon paradigm of development. For European oil and gas companies, the development of clean hydrogen projects is a natural policy since oil processing is the largest final consumer of hydrogen. Opportunities to increase production of new low-carbon energy sources are critical for European energy companies. It is concluded that hydrogen energy in Europe is developing in accordance with the algorithm previously applied in the sector of green renewable electricity. The driver of hydrogen projects is the political choice of the EU in favor of the green economy and decarbonization. Relatively high production costs allow companies to develop green hydrogen projects only relying on government support and large-scale subsidies from national and European budgets.

J	Rayner, T; Russel, D; Lorenzoni, I				Rayner, Tim; Russel, Duncan; Lorenzoni, Irene			'It's Demand, Stupid': The Failure and Future of Integrating Climate Change Concerns into UK Transport Policy	BRITISH POLITICS			English	Article						climate change; transport policy; new labour	POLITICS	Since 1997, successive Labour Governments have prioritised action on climate change. The United Kingdom is commonly perceived to be an international leader in terms of its global diplomatic efforts and, to a lesser extent, its domestic policy response. However, the UK's carbon dioxide emissions from the transport and housing sectors are increasing. In this paper, we focus on the transport sector and examine the extent to which policies have encouraged decarbonisation, and the underlying reasons behind their relative success or failure. Despite initial good intentions, policies aimed at improved efficiency, encouragement of less polluting modes of transport and reductions in demand have fallen short. Underlying this failure, we argue that the transport sector's traditional prioritising of the immediate economic implications of policy and the government's fear of being seen to impinge upon personal mobility have resulted in too strong a reliance on technological solutions rather than measures that seek to curb demand through behavioural change. We conclude by arguing that unless demand for carbon intensive forms of transport is reduced, the government will struggle to meet its increasingly ambitious carbon dioxide reduction targets, but that important new legislative initiatives at national and EU level offer chances for a more concerted approach.

The surprisingly inexpensive cost of state-driven emission control strategies	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article							PARIS AGREEMENT; PUBLIC-OPINION; CLIMATE; POLICY	Traditionally, analysis of the costs of cutting greenhouse gas emissions has assumed that governments would implement idealized, optimal policies such as uniform economy-wide carbon taxes. Yet actual policies in the real world, especially in large federal governments, are often highly heterogeneous and vary in political support and administrative capabilities within a country. While the benefits of heterogeneous action have been discussed widely for experimentation and leadership, little is known about its costs. Focusing on the United States, we represent plausible variation (by more than a factor of 3) in the stringency of state-led climate policy in a process-based integrated assessment model (GCAM-USA). For a wide array of national decarbonization targets, we find that the nationwide cost from heterogeneous subnational policies is only one-tenth higher than nationally uniform policies. Such results hinge on two critical technologies (advanced biofuels and electricity) for which inter-state trade ameliorates the economic efficiencies that might arise with heterogeneous action. The nationwide cost of cutting emissions can be affected by local policies. This study considers the differences across the US states, with integrated assessment model results showing that varying state policies only increases nationwide costs by about 10%.

Public acceptance of sustainable energy innovations in the European Union: A multidimensional comparative framework for national policy	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Public acceptance; Innovation; Decarbonization; Renewable energy; Energy efficiency; Environmental taxes	ELECTRIC VEHICLE ADOPTION; RENEWABLE ENERGY; WIND ENERGY; SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE; ENVIRONMENTAL BEHAVIOR; CHOICE EXPERIMENTS; COMMUNITY ENERGY; DECISION-MAKING; HOUSEHOLD; ATTITUDES	Public acceptance of sustainable energy innovations and policies is of crucial importance in enabling the transition to decarbonized energy systems necessary to meet the key climate targets of the Paris Agreement. This is particularly important in the context of the European Union, which is the third largest energy-related greenhouse gas emitter in the world. However, achieving acceptance is complex and requires improved understanding of the underlying conditions that are likely to motivate it. To contribute to this understanding and overcome common shortcomings in the literature, this paper presents a multidimensional and cross-national framework for the factors that have the potential to motivate both dimensions of acceptance, namely adoption and support. The innovations of interest are numerous and include electric vehicles, residential solar panels, energy-efficient home insulation, environmental taxes and incentives. The paper employs multilevel regression analysis and combines individual and contextual data from all the European Union nations to demonstrate the significance of various types of predictors in motivating acceptance. It is found that citizens' personal capabilities and attitudes towards life satisfaction, climate change and the environment influence both dimensions of acceptance. Attitudes towards broader socio-political dimensions such as representation, equity and transparency primarily influence support, whereas national environmental and energy policy indicators primarily influence adoption. Overall, this paper provides evidence suggesting governments should simultaneously address both dimensions of acceptance, through a combination of different means: enhancing support through strategies that target attitudes and preferences, and market-based environmental policies that promote adoption at the household level.

A systems perspective analysis of an increased use of forest bioenergy in Canada: Potential carbon impacts and policy recommendations	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Forest bioenergy; Sustainability governance; Carbon accounting; Wood resource balance; Pan-Canadian Framework; Socio-ecological system	CLIMATE; CONSUMPTION; RESIDUES; WOOD	The Government of Canada aims at reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030 (compared to 2005) and reaching net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. Several of the climate actions under development would incentivize an increased use of forest biomass for energy. However, lessons learned from bioenergy policies worldwide have shown that increasing the use of bioenergy can impact the forest sector as a whole and that the carbon impacts of bioenergy should be assessed holistically to limit unintended negative consequences. This study aims to summarize and present existing data in a manner that enables the Canadian government and stakeholders to identify bioenergy pathways that can contribute to Canada's decarbonization targets. Firstly, we synthetize existing statistical datasets on wood removals and uses into a holistic picture of wood flows across Canada's economy. We find that, in 2017, a minimum of 77.7 Mm(3) of wood were used for energy in Canada, and that reported quantities of wood used exceeded the amount of wood removals by 14-33 Mm(3) annually. Thus, while 72% of wood used for energy in 2017 derived from secondary industry residues, the origin of 26% of wood for energy cannot be identified, seriously hindering any consideration on the sustainability of the current forest bioenergy use in Canada. Secondly, we assess that the amount of wood used for energy might increase by 5.5-20.4 Mm(3) by 2030. In order to identify the potential impacts of this extra bioenergy demand on GHG emissions, we reviewed relevant literature based on our qualitative analysis of the system dynamics of the forest sector in response to such an increased demand. Our results show that unless targeted measures are defined to stimulate the use of residues, it is possible that direct and indirect biogenic GHG emissions from increased use of forest bioenergy will undermine Canada's decarbonization goals. We recommend several measures to avoid this, including: discouraging the dedicated harvest of logs for bioenergy, prioritizing the collection and use of logging residues which are usually burned at roadside, and favoring the recovery and use of post-consumer wood. In addition, we recommend improving the consistency among statistical datasets on Canada's forestry sector.

J	French, S				French, Sam			The Role of Zero and Low Carbon Hydrogen in Enabling the Energy Transition and the Path to Net Zero Greenhouse Gas Emissions With global policies and demonstration projects hydrogen can play a role in a net zero future	JOHNSON MATTHEY TECHNOLOGY REVIEW			English	Article								As public pressure to limit global warming continues to rise, governments, policy makers and regulators are looking for the most effective ways to achieve the target set by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to keep the global temperature increase to below 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. This will require the world to move to net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, and numerous governments have committed to reach net zero by this date, or even earlier. It is widely recognised that achieving net zero at the state, country and regional levels will necessitate a systems-wide approach across all the major sources of GHG emissions, which include power generation, transport, industrial processes and heating. Land use is also critical with billions of trees needing to be planted and a change in the amount of meat eaten. There is a growing realisation that hydrogen has a vital role to play, particularly to decarbonise sectors and applications that are otherwise extremely difficult to abate, such as industrial processes, heavy duty freight movement, dispatchable power generation and heating applications. Hydrogen will also provide long-term (for instance seasonal) energy storage, enabling much greater uptake of renewable power generation, which itself is a key prerequisite of the clean energy transition. Hydrogen can play a role in the decarbonisation of all major segments, and this means it can facilitate cross-sector coupling, enabling the exploitation of synergies between different key parts of the economy. This article discusses the different production routes to low and zero carbon hydrogen, and its uses across numerous applications to minimise and eliminate carbon dioxide and GHG emissions, building a picture of the key role that hydrogen will play in the energy transition and the broader global move towards decarbonisation and climate stabilisation. An overview of some of the ongoing and planned demonstration projects will be presented, outlining the importance of such activities in providing confidence that the hydrogen approach is the right one for multiple geographies around the world and that there are technologies that are ready to be deployed today.

This is done for Germany in terms of a case study. For this analysis we apply a German energy system model and calculate three scenarios with different combinations of overall and transport specific targets. One of the key results is that especially for goods transport on roads the evolution of conventional drivetrains will not be sufficient to reach ambitious decarbonization targets. A portfolio of electrified drivetrains with batteries and hydrogen as well as power to liquid fuels with low carbon footprints or trolley trucks at main highway routes will be mandatory.

Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) technologies appear among the most promising routes to the decarbonization process. We propose an equilibrium model where final-goods production uses labor and energy, and energy is generated using non-polluting RES and polluting fossil fuels. The government implements a Green Tax Reform (GTR), where it imposes a tax on emissions and uses revenues to finance subsidies to RES and support to CCS technologies. We test how results change according to the priority given to RES or to CCS support. Our results show that prioritizing RES support achieves better economic results and potentially also better environmental results. Overall, our empirical simulation demonstrates that resource substitution has a stronger benefit than decarbonizing fossil fuels. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a feasibility study of green hydrogen production from wind-powered electrolysis with further direct reduction of iron ore for green steel manufacturing. According to the analysis, the difference in cash flows between standard steelmaking technology and direct reduction of iron ore with hydrogen is 20% which in the long term could be reduced to 5%. Compared to the European Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, companies will be able to save about 3% of the present value. To achieve the commercial attractiveness of hydrogen production by electrolysis, the minimum amount of government subsidies should be at least 10% of capital expenditures from 2021 with a gradual increase to 20% by 2040 to support the emerging market.

Against calls within civil society for dramatic decarbonisation, the continued expansion of the fossil fuel industry is constructed by governments and business as 'common sense'. By analysing the political process surrounding the 2016 and 2017 coral bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef, we show how a fossil fuel hegemony has been upheld against the counter-hegemonic forces of environmental critique and the catastrophic bleaching events. By distinguishing between politics (i.e. strategies, practices and discourses) and the political (i.e. the antagonism constitutive of societies), we explain what different hegemonic practices achieve in the process of establishing and defending hegemony. In our case, this resulted in downplaying emissions mitigation and emphasising local climate change adaptation. Through the political process, business solutions and self-regulation were presented as the logical response to the climate crisis.

Social Networks and Climate Change Policy Preferences: Structural Location and Policy Actor Support for Fossil Fuel Production	SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES			English	Article						Block model; climate change; fossil fuel; oil sands; policy networks; social networks	ADVOCACY COALITIONS; CANADA; MANAGEMENT; MODELS; COLLABORATION; INNOVATION; FRAMEWORK; ACCESS; POWER	Contrary to what is needed for reducing global GHG emissions, successive Canadian governments have placed fossil fuel production at the core of national economic development. This presents a puzzle: how should we understand contradictory political commitments to the Paris agreement and low carbon energy futures, on one hand, and the persistence of support for fossil fuel centered energy futures, on the other hand. Using a policy network perspective, we ask: Is the location of actors within a climate change policy network associated with their position on curtailing the Alberta oil sands development? Results show that actors' social network positions are associated with their support for curtailing oil sands development. This network association persists even when the sectoral affiliation and climate change beliefs of actors are statistically controlled. Our results demonstrate that policy network analysis helps explain the persistence of the contradictory politics of fossil fuel development and support for decarbonization.

J	Saether, SR				Saether, Simen Rostad			Climate policy choices: An empirical study of the effects on the OECD and BRICS power sector emission intensity	ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND POLICY			English	Article						CO2 emission intensity; Climate policies; Power sector; OECD; BRICS	EU ETS; ALLOCATION; ABATEMENT; STANDARD; IMPACTS	A crucial and challenging part of the worldwide energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy is the decarbonization of the power sector. As governments struggle to pass politically feasible, emission-reducing policies that align with other national and international goals, empirical studies can provide insights for policymakers on the question of whether various approaches to combating climate change have effectively contributed to reducing CO2 emissions. This paper investigates the effect of several key climate policies that governments have implemented in order to reduce CO2 emission intensity in the power sector; used in this analysis are newly constructed panel data on 34 OECD countries and the 5 BRICS countries that range from 2000 to 2018. The main findings of this paper suggest that, despite a strong theoretical foundation, the market-based policy tested in this analysis does not display a significant negative effect on CO2 emission intensity. Technological innovation support-policies and deployment-support policies such as feed-in tariffs for wind power production correlate negatively with CO2 emission intensity. Feed-in tariffs for solar PV and public environmental R&D expenditure do not indicate a significant effect on emission intensity. (C) 2021 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland.

J	Florez-Orrego, D; Marechal, F; de Oliveira, S				Florez-Orrego, Daniel; Marechal, Francois; de Oliveira Junior, Silvio			Comparative exergy and economic assessment of fossil and biomass-based routes for ammonia production	ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Contemporary Problems of Thermal Engineering (CPOTE)	SEP 18-21, 2018	Gliwice, POLAND			Renewability; Decarbonization; Exergy; Fertilizers; Energy integration	THERMODYNAMIC ANALYSIS; HYDROGEN; ETHANOL; GASIFICATION; ELECTRICITY; INTEGRATION; METHANOL; DESIGN; FUELS; HEAT	The use of biomass gasification for partially or totally replacing methane in the integrated syngas and ammonia production plant is compared with the performance of the conventional route, typically based on steam methane reforming. However, by undertaking novel designs, additional or totally different demands are created. Consequently, the optimal integration approach between the new chemical plant and the alternative utility systems must be updated, so that the power and steam requirements remain satisfied. To this end, a systematic framework that allows selecting the most suitable utility systems whereas satisfying the minimum energy requirements (MER) with lower operating cost is adopted. The combined energy integration and exergy analyses proved to be relevant, especially regarding the integration of reactive components and the combined heat and power production (CHP) as well as the reduction of avoidable exergy losses. The exergy efficiencies of the natural gas and biomass-based ammonia production plants average 65.8% and 41.3%, respectively, and the overall emission balances vary from 0.5 to -2.3 t(CO2)/t(NH3), respectively. Despite the lower efficiency, higher operating revenues are achieved by totally replacing the costly natural gas input and avoiding the electricity import, favoring the consumption of a fraction of the syngas produced as fuel. Finally, it must be noticed that by defining an extended industrial framework, the inefficiencies at the upstream feedstock supply chains can be also accounted for, which entails a further reduction of 10-15% of the overall ammonia production efficiency. Accordingly, even by fully substituting the natural gas consumption with renewable energy resources, the sustainability of the overall system becomes rather an intricate function of the performance of the feedstock supply chains, the electricity mix enclosing the chemical system, the ammonia production plant and the main components thereof, as well as of the cost ratio of the resources consumed.

J	Ciotola, A; Fuss, M; Colombo, S; Poganietz, WR				Ciotola, Angela; Fuss, Maryegli; Colombo, Simone; Poganietz, Witold-Roger			The potential supply risk of vanadium for the renewable energy transition in Germany	JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE			English	Article						Critical metals; Risk assessment; Decarbonisation; Sustainable paths; Vanadium-redox flow batteries	REDOX FLOW BATTERIES; SYSTEM; HEALTH; CRITICALITY; EXPOSURE; SAFETY	Vanadium-based Redox Flow Batteries (VRFBs) seem to be a promising solution for medium and large storage systems required to smooth the fluctuating provision of solar and wind energy. Beside technological considerations, the challenge for VRFBs is the availability of vanadium, influenced by the high demand by the steel and chemical sectors and the small number of mines operating worldwide. Given vanadium's toxicity, the health, safety, and environmental (HSE) implications might, too, affect vanadium's availability. This study assesses the risks of supply disruptions associated with vanadium for VRFBs for the German market through the Holistic Risk Analysis and Modelling (HoRAM) method. The analysis includes not only technological parameters but also HSE and societal ones. In total, 242 variables were selected to characterize vanadium's supply chain. Considering a successful energy transformation in 2050, four logic-stochastic models were created to assess the supply risks associated with four different market shares of VRFBs at the storage market, i.e. 10%, 25%, 50%, and 100%. The most crucial factor influencing the overall risk of supply turned out to be mining activities. These are driven by a lack of qualified personnel, but the HSE and societal aspects can also hamper the supply chain. Therefore, both the Government and companies should consider these aspects to better orientate their future strategies. Of the four analysed market shares, surprisingly the 50% one has shown the lowest risk. Further, the mitigation strategy of opening the domestic market could reduce the risk of vanadium supply disruption, i.e. high impacts for VRFBs.

While deep decarbonization of all sectors is required to meet the Paris Agreement target, DAC can help deal with difficult to avoid emissions (aviation, ocean-shipping, iron-steel, cement, mining, plastics, fertilizers, pulp and paper). While large-scale deployment of DAC discussions continues, a closer look to the capital and operational costs, different capture technologies, the choice of energy source, land and water requirements, and other environmental impacts of DAC are reviewed and examined. Cost per ton of CO2 captured discussions of leading industrial DAC developers with their carbon capture technologies are presented, and their detailed cost comparisons are evaluated based on the choice of energy operation together with process energy requirements. Validation of two active plants' net negative emission contributions after reducing their own carbon footprint is presented. Future directions and recommendations to lower the current capital and operational costs of DAC are given. In view of large-scale deployment of DAC, and the considerations of high capital costs, private investments, government initiatives, net zero commitments of corporations, and support from the oil companies combined will help increase carbon capture capacity by building more DAC plants worldwide.

India's socio-economic prosperity is dependent on modern energy. The authors examine the role of biofuel in India's emerging fuel mix. Design/methodology/approach A 20-year timeframe between 2000 and 2021 was set to learn about the subject and find the existing gaps. Of the 40 research papers, the authors found using keywords and delimiting criteria in the database, the authors have shortlisted 21 papers, which provided the theoretical framework for the study. Additionally, the authors used the government database to develop future projections using compound annual growth rate and trend analysis. Findings The study findings suggest that India should strictly implement the Biofuel Policy to promote indigenous production of biofuel to enhance affordability and accessibility. With blending options available with biofuels and biogas, the country can replace the right proportion of fossil fuel use by 2050. It will not only decrease India's import dependence but also will create new job opportunities, specifically in tribal and remote locations and promote green energy mix. With emerging options like electric vehicle and hydrogen, the transport sector could be decarbonized to a greater extent. Social implications Indigenous cleaner fuel adoption and transport sector will generate additional employment and cut down fossil fuel import. Financial savings through reduced fossil fuel import will be directed toward social development. Originality/value The paper carries out critical analysis for the active use of modern green fuels in the present and coming days. Such unique analysis must help India to balance its energy basket.

However countries with the most ambitious programs of this type (Denmark, Germany and Spain) have experienced a noticeable increase in electricity costs. Quota programs, combined with some form of tradable carbon certificates, have typically produced a lesser response with lower impact on consumers. Assured access to grids has also played an important role in expediting growth. Both genres of policy instruments increase global demand for renewable technologies, thereby promoting dynamic efficiency However other inefficiencies remain. Feed-in-tariffs place primary onus of technology selection and support on governments and regulators Limitations on carbon trade reduce effectiveness and increase costs as well. The next generation of instruments would benefit from better locational and temporal price signals.

The methodology and approach presented are relevant for other countries heading in the same direction. The focus is on strategies to further develop the sustainable biomass resources and conversion technologies within energy and transport paired with CCUS (carbon capture utilisation and storage) to coordinate with other sectors and achieve a fully decarbonised society. By using hourly energy system modelling and a Smart Energy Systems approach, it is possible to create a robust multiple technology strategy and keep the sustainable bioenergy levels. The results are presented as principles and guidelines on how to include the use of sustainable biomass in the individual country as an integrated part of global decarbonisation.

The current embodied GHG emissions benchmarks allow design teams to make a relative comparison between buildings and infrastructure but are not linked to sector or national GHG emissions reduction targets. This paper describes a novel model that links sector-level embodied GHG emissions estimates with project calculations. This provides a framework to consistently translate international, national and sector reduction targets into project targets. The required level of long-term GHG emissions reduction from improvements in building design and material manufacture is heavily dependent on external factors that the industry does not control, such as demand for new stock and the rate of electrical grid 'decarbonisation'. A scenario analysis using the model suggests that, even if external factors progress along the better end of UK government projections, current practices will be insufficient to meet sector targets.

J	Schwerhoff, G; Franks, M				Schwerhoff, Gregor; Franks, Max			Optimal Environmental Taxation with Capital Mobility(*)	FISCAL STUDIES			English	Article						capital mobility; climate policy; tax competition; equity	CARBON LEAKAGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TAX; ENERGY; IMPACTS; POLICY	Climate policy exemptions for energy-intensive sectors are often justified with distributional concerns. One concern is that households employed in energy-intensive sectors might be affected disproportionally because of (international) capital mobility. By assuming that workers cannot move freely between sectors, we can reproduce this concern: uniform climate policy causes more inequality between the sectors when capital is mobile than when it is not. However, we find that affected households can be relieved more effectively with sector-specific labour taxes than with sector-specific climate policy. The reason for this finding is that households benefit more directly from sector-specific labour tax cuts than from climate policy exemptions. Keeping climate policy uniform across sectors has the added benefit of creating incentives for long-term decarbonisation. In addition, we find that the differential effect of capital mobility depends on the government's degree of inequality aversion - redistribution is more expensive when capital is mobile.

Whilst the focus of climate change adaptation in Wales has been wintertime decarbonisation through the introduction of energy efficiency measures, Welsh Government now want to understand the summertime impacts of climate change on the occupants of Welsh housing. The aim of this project was to test the hypothesis that summertime indoor housing conditions in Wales will diminish as a consequence of climate change. A six-week period from 22nd July-31st August was modelled using UK 2018 local climate projections, baseline, 2030 and 2070 respectively. The results reveal increased incidences of summertime overheating in a majority of dwellings. The poorest performing dwellings were post 1990 dwellings, flats and properties with internal wall insulation. The results show that cooling strategies to reduce indoor air temperature will increasingly be required. The other indoor vulnerability modelled was that of moisture. Results demonstrate the potential for poorer indoor environmental quality due to increased relative humidity. Every location will experience increases in relative humidity regardless of dwelling typology. Relative humidity will be highest in pre-1919 dwellings and dwellings with solid stone walls. The results show that ventilation strategies to improve the extraction of moisture-laden air, whilst diluting the concentration of pollutants that are present indoors, are required if these dwellings are to avoid increased incidences of condensation, damp, and mould growth, and adverse impacts from other allergens, particles and pollutants.

Following years of diplomatic gridlock, it laid the foundations for a new global climate regime that invites states to partner with nonstate actors in the transition to the low-carbon society. This article critically examines the political rationalities that inform the pluralization of climate politics after Paris and the turn toward cooperative modes of governing. Drawing on an analysis of initiatives led by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that were launched to engage nonstate actors in the evolving Paris regime, we identify a global governmentality that mobilizes nonstate actors as active and responsible partners in the quest for rapid and deep decarbonization. In its search for cooperative and efficient forms of problem management, we argue, this form of rule nurtures a global space free from friction and opposition where businesses, investors, and industry are elevated as the real partners of government.

Analysing Key Policies and Pathways in Norway's Electricity Transitions	POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE			English	Article						decentralised energy system; energy transition; organisational field	CLIMATE-CHANGE; INNOVATION; POLITICS	With national electricity systems, 'transition' may involve decentralising production and ownership, and digitalising the system. These processes are facilitated by smart metering, 'prosunning; and changes in consumer behaviour. Driving factors may be national steering, or the process can be left to the market. In Norway, the government has opted for tightly steered national coordination of three key areas: national smart-meter implementation (since 2011), prosumer regulation (since 2016), and a national end-user demand flexibility regulation (expected to be adopted in 2020). These regulations influence production patterns, energy flows and grid activities. Drawing on organisational fields theory, this article asks: Why was it decided to adopt these policies centrally? Which actors have had greatest influence on policy outputs? And, finally, what of the possible implications? The regulations, developed in a sector in a state of field crisis, have generally been supported by the relevant actors. The Norwegian case can help to explain incumbent roles and field crisis, as well as nuanced drivers in complex transitions, beyond decarbonisation.

The adaptation of existing business models to the resulting market changes can also involve such entrepreneurial opportunities. However, if companies are forced to implement them, for instance due to government regulations, this results in a concept that deviates from the entrepreneurial opportunity and requires a special adaptation of the business model. This concerns, for example, the decarbonization of industrial steel production through green hydrogen. In addition to the derivation of green hydrogen as such a forced opportunity, the article analyzes the influences and their effects on the business model of German crude steel producers. The result is an extension of the generally applicable Business Model Canvas to include the level of regulatory challenges.

This paper develops a novel Dynamic Economic and Emission Dispatch (DEED) model for a combined conventional and wind power system incorporating the carbon price floor (CPF) and the Emission Performance Standard (EPS) that is supported by the EMR. The proposed model aims to determine the optimal operation strategy for the given system on power dispatch taking into account wind power waste and reserve and also the environmental aspect, especially the CPF of greenhouse gases and the emission limit of the EPS for different decarbonisation scenarios. Case studies for the demand profile in the Sheffield region in the UK with different time intervals is presented. The results indicate that renewable power is superior in both the economics and emissions to a mid to long-term energy strategy in the UK.

The work draws on the impact made by the national (UK) and regional (EU) low carbon policy instruments on the UK road sector. The results show that the transformation pathway, which is at the take-off phase on a large scale, is the only fully active pathway. The transformation is mainly characterized by the adoption of biofuel blends and hybrid electric vehicles, as well as niche technologies. For the emergence of an ideal low carbon road system in the UK, it is shown that the transformation pathway is insufficient and the likely pathway sequence to full decarbonization will be transformation-substitution-de-alignment/re-alignment. However, the dynamics that can favour a smooth process of this sequence will demand a range of active niche technologies and strong government intervention.

In this article, I argue that despite an exceptional clean energy resource endowment, options to demonstrate the country's serious intentions to meet its international climate commitments while keeping a sizeable oil and natural gas production sector come with complex implications well beyond the simplistic economic challenge linked to replacing the sector's exports and employment levels. I explore three such options to keep oil and gas production high by using techno-economic modeling: compensating with more reductions elsewhere, using CCS in the oil and gas sector to avoid the sector's emissions, and using negative emission technologies to compensate them. Compared with reducing emissions through large cuts in oil and gas production levels, each of these options comes with both significantly higher costs for society and a much higher risk of not delivering the expected emissions reductions.

Serban			Modeling Low Climate Stabilization with E3MG: Towards a 'New Economics' Approach to Simulating Energy-Environment-Economy System Dynamics	ENERGY JOURNAL			English	Article							TECHNICAL CHANGE; TECHNOLOGIES	The literature on climate stabilization modeling largely refers to either energy-system or inter-temporal computable general equilibrium/optimal growth models. We contribute with a different perspective by deploying a large-scale macro-econometric hybrid simulation model of the global energy-environment-economy (E3MG) adopting a "New Economics" approach. We use E3MG to assess the implications of a low-stabilization target of 400ppm CO2 equivalent by 2100, assuming both fiscal instruments and regulation. We assert that if governments adopt more stringent climate targets for rapid and early decarbonization, such actions are likely to induce more investment and increased technological change in favor of low-carbon alternatives. Contrary to the conventional view on the economics of climate change, a transition towards a low-carbon society as modeled with E3MG leads to macroeconomic benefits, especially in conditions of unemployment, with GDP slightly above a reference scenario, depending on use of tax or auction revenues. In addition, more stringent action can lead to higher benefits.	[Barker, Terry; Scrieciu, S.

This study compares policy pathways to meet this goal in the case of Canada: a ZEV sales mandate, a vehicle emissions standard (VES), a feebate system, and several combinations. We use the AUtomaker-consumer Model (AUM) to simulate the interaction of realistic consumer and automaker behaviour over the time horizon, with outputs including ZEV sales, GHG emissions, and policy costs (calculated as lost consumer surplus and automaker profits). All three policy types can potentially achieve the ZEV sales goal, though the ZEV mandate provides greater certainty. Further, the ZEV mandate is the most cost-effective way to meet the 2035 ZEV sales goal ($/tonne abated), followed by combinations of a ZEV-mandate with a VES. The feebate is costlier than the other policy types.

A Markov-switching equilibrium approach	ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW			English	Article						Green energy investment; Economic policy uncertainty; Natural resources; Markov-switching equilibrium correction; model; China	TIME-SERIES; UNIT-ROOT; PROCESS INNOVATION; RENEWABLE ENERGY; ERROR-CORRECTION; COINTEGRATION; HYPOTHESIS	Energy efficiency has enormous potential for boosting economic development while simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Energy efficiency improvements are widely accepted as a necessary corollary of China's decarbonisation efforts. This study analysed key factors in green energy investment and its determinants, i.e. natural resources and uncertainty of economic policy on greenhouse gas emissions, from 1987 to 2019. This work conduct a thorough empirical analysis and used innovative econometric techniques, such as the Markovswitching equilibrium correction model for long-run estimation and the kernel-based regularised least squares machine-learning approach, to establish the direction of causality for the variables in this study. The results indicate that green energy investment is significantly correlated with greenhouse gas emissions and helps to support environmental quality. However, although natural resources and economic policy uncertainty support economic growth, they are harmful to environmental quality. This conclusion implies that the Chinese government should exploit green energy investment to strengthen environmental performance as its long-term strategy.

This article examines power sector (de)centralization operationalized along three functional dimensions: political, administrative and economic. We apply this framework to empirically assess the changes in California's electricity market, which saw the emergence of institutional innovation in the form of community choice aggregation (CCA). Unpacking the Californian case illustrates how decision-making has moved from central state government and regulators to the municipal level in uneven ways and without decentralized generation keeping pace. We also explore the impacts this multidimensional and diversified decentralization has on the ultimate goals of energy transition: decarbonization and energy security. Our framework and empirical findings challenge the conventional view on decentralization and problematize the widespread assumptions of its positive influence on climate mitigation and grid stability.

J	Tan, XC; Wang, Y; Gu, BH; Kong, LS; Zeng, A				Tan, Xian-Chun; Wang, Yi; Gu, Bai-He; Kong, Ling-Si; Zeng, An			Research on the national climate governance system toward carbon neutrality-A critical literature review	FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Review						Carbon neutrality; National climate governance system; Top-level design; Governance paradigm; Climate adaptation	CO2 EMISSIONS; CHANGE ADAPTATION; PARIS AGREEMENT; CHINA; POLICY; MITIGATION; REDUCTION; EQUITY; ALLOCATION; EFFICIENCY	Global climate governance has entered the era of carbon neutrality, as a growing number of countries have set the goal of carbon neutrality for long-term emissions reduction toward the mid-21st century. In 2020, China also pledged itself to the goal of carbon neutrality, which creates an urgent demand for this country to establish a systematic and integrated national climate governance system. Against this background, this paper conducts a systematic literature review of climate governance systems from the perspectives of top-level design and the governance paradigm to bring insights into climate governance toward carbon neutrality. The results show that although there are interactions between decarbonization and other environmental, social and economic fields, research gaps still exist when enhancing climate governance toward carbon neutrality. For example, issues regarding incorporating climate factors into the overall economic and social layout, strengthening the capacity of data collection relevant to climate adaptation, integrating climate mitigation and adaption actions, as well as connecting domestic climate governance and international cooperation, need to be further addressed. In addition, within the national governance system, studies combining both regional and sectoral concerns and the intertemporal dynamic allocation mechanism need to be further addressed when China decomposes its national climate target. Moreover, the division of power between the central government and local government, as well as the communication scheme between government and non-state actors, also turns out to be important for effective governance. Based on this analysis, policy implications are further proposed for China's formulation and implementation of long-term strategies of climate governance toward carbon neutrality.

J	Strachan, N				Strachan, Neil			UK energy policy ambition and UK energy modelling-fit for purpose?	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Energy models; Scenarios; Policy ambition		Aiming to lead amongst other G20 countries, the UK government has classified the twin energy policy priorities of decarbonisation and security of supply as a "centennial challenge". This viewpoint discusses the UK's capacity for energy modelling and scenario building as a critical underpinning of iterative decision making to meet these policy ambitions. From a nadir, over the last decade UK modelling expertise has been steadily built up. However extreme challenges remain in the level and consistency of funding of core model teams - critical to ensure a full scope of energy model types and hence insights, and in developing new state-of-the-art models to address evolving uncertainties. Meeting this challenge will facilitate a broad scope of types and geographical scale of UK's analytical tools to responsively deliver the evidence base for a range of public and private sector decision makers, and ensure that the UK contributes to global efforts to advance the field of energy-economic modelling.

Offshore wind power is significant in the decarbonization of energy and the construction of future power systems. With the support and regulation of the government, offshore wind power is gradually developing on a large scale, and the pricing of renewable energy, including offshore wind power, has become a key research topic in the electricity market. In this paper, a life cycle costing-based pricing model for offshore wind power with carbon trading is constructed. First, the theoretical on-grid electricity price for offshore wind power is calculated, the sensitivity analysis of its influencing factors is then conducted, and the corresponding solutions are proposed at the end. The results show that the price of offshore wind power will gradually decrease, which has the potential to lower the on-grid electricity price and participate in the market competition.

With the urgency of the climate crisis being at the forefront of government policy agendas, it is important to focus on the commercialization of fusion power plants to support decarbonization commitments. This work argues that the cost optimization of fusion as well as the development of a compelling value proposition enhances the contribution that fusion can bring to target energy markets. In particular, it focuses on how both aspects are being considered for the Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (STEP) program (Wilson et al., 2020) which is currently developing both the conceptual design for a prototype power plant as well as a pathway to commercialization on its mission to "Deliver a U.K. prototype fusion energy plant, targeting 2040, and a path to commercial viability of fusion."

This study examines diverse scenarios for operational greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions in freight transport within the Northeastern United States and quantifies both the cumulative GHGs and the net present values (NPV). This study considers commercialized Class 8 heavy-duty trucks that operate on petroleum diesel or bio-based diesel fuel and a battery-electric option that has not yet reached commercialization and applies an investment timing methodology along with a comprehensive sensitivity analysis. The low fossil carbon scenarios incorporate the social cost of carbon as an internalized benefit. For the baseline weight-limited cargo scenario, this study finds that the bio-based diesel to battery-electric scenario produces the highest NPV and lowest operational carbon impact, while the bio-based diesel option is responsible for the second highest NPV and second lowest operational carbon impact. Under a volume-limited cargo option (10% discount rate), the bio-based diesel to battery-electric scenario yields the highest NPV, followed by the bio-based diesel scenario. The sensitivity analysis reveals that several factors impact the NPVs. Additionally, this study shows the significant impact of the timing of emission reductions on the cumulative operational carbon impact generated.

However, in order to be truly useful, these scenarios should not only be possible but also plausible. In this paper, we have used lessons from historical energy transitions to create a set of diagnostic tests to assess the feasibility of an example 2 degrees C scenario (generated using the least cost optimization model, TIAM-Grantham). The key assessment criteria included the rate of deployment of low carbon technologies and the rate of transition between primary energy resources. The rates of deployment of key low-carbon technologies were found to exceed the maximum historically observed rate of deployment of 20% per annum. When constraints were added to limit the scenario to within historically observed rates of change, the model no longer solved for 2 degrees C. Under these constraints, the lowest median 2100 temperature change for which a solution was found was about 2.1 degrees C and at more than double the cumulative cost of the unconstrained scenario. The analysis in this paper highlights the considerable challenge of meeting 2 degrees C, requiring rates of energy supply technology deployment and rates of declines in fossil fuels which are unprecedented.

World governments have pledged to bring 13 million plug-in electric vehicles on the road by 2020 and 100 million by 2030. The rapid expansion required to meet these targets, from a global stock of 5 million electric vehicles in 2018, has the potential to be constrained by material supply chains. This study has identified 7 key elements which are significant supply risks to the electric vehicle industry: battery grade natural graphite, lithium and cobalt for electric vehicle batteries, and the rare earth elements dysprosium, terbium, praseodymium and neodymium for electric vehicle motors. None of these elements are able to be substituted without (i) increasing the supply risk of the other constrained elements, or (ii) altering industry wide manufacturing processes. The inability to fully mitigate material supply risks at the required market expansion rates is a key issue for minimising carbon emissions from the transportation sector.

Energy Efficiency and Global Warming Potential of a Wind-Energy Complex at Brazilian Piaui State	ADVANCES IN PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS: INITIATIVES FOR A SUSTAINABLE WORLD	IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	IFIP Working Group 5.7 International Conference on Advances in Production Management Systems (APMS)	SEP 03-07, 2016	BRAZIL	IFIP Working Grp 5 7		Embodied energy; Global warming; Wind-electricity	FARM	The human addiction to fossil fuel and global warming leads to the search for alternative energy sources. The Brazilian government intends to increase its dependence on renewable energy sources, including hydropower, biomass, and wind. Many political and economic efforts have been directed to wind-energy, however, there is a lack of case-specific information regarding its performance for CO2 emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. The aim of this work is to assess the global warming potential (GWP) and the fossil energy embodied in an important wind-energy complex located at Piaui State, Brazil. Results show that evaluated wind-complex demands lower amount of fossil energy (0.0404 MJ) and has lower GWP (4.13 gCO(2)(-eq)) per kWh of electricity generated when compared to landmark studies. Wind-electricity showed better performance than hydroelectricity (0.1516 MJ/kWh and 11.84 gCO(2)(-eq) /kWh), which supports wind-electricity as an important alternative towards an economy decarbonization.

As the affordable deployment of these technologies grows vulnerable to materials price changes, effective strategies must be identified to mitigate the risk of higher input costs faced by manufacturers. To better understand potential threats to deployment, a market modeling approach was developed to quantify economic risk factors including material demand, substitutability, recycling, mining productivity, resource quality, and discovery. Results demonstrate that price changes are determined by interactions between demand growth, mining productivity, and resource quality. In the worst cases with high demand and low productivity, development of material substitutes and large recycling rates help reduce the prevalence of price risk from similar to 90% to under 10%. Investing in these strategies yields significant benefits for manufacturers and governments concerned about costs of materials critical to decarbonization and other advanced technologies.

J	Paddeu, D; Denby, J				Paddeu, Daniela; Denby, Jozef			Decarbonising road freight: Is truck automation and platooning an opportunity?	CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY			English	Article						Decarbonisation; Road freight transport; Platooning; Stakeholder perspective; Multi-scenario analysis; Policy implications	ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; VEHICLES	Governments, industry and academia are paying high attention to autonomous vehicles and platooning, due to their high potential to transform public and private transport and reduce carbon emissions generated by road transport. The road freight sector is expected to be an early adopter of the autonomous technology due to the potential cost reduction for logistics companies. However, despite the expected fuel savings and polluting emission reductions due to truck platooning, actual benefits would strongly depend on the adopted technology and the operational conditions of the system. This paper investigates the potential for truck platooning to reduce carbon emissions from road freight, presenting a series of scenarios that vary by adoption rates, operational models and platoon size. Scenarios were co-designed with freight stakeholders to build a Truck Platooning Roadmap (2025-2050), considering a specific case study: the UK. Polluting emissions and related external costs are calculated across the different scenarios. Results show that there is high uncertainty for the adoption of truck platooning, with a potential first phase involving a small pool of low-automated trucks, and a second phase with a larger pool of high-automated trucks, reflecting higher economic and environmental benefits. A series of other technological and policy considerations are presented to support policymakers to draw a zero-carbon road freight strategy. [GRAPHICS] .

J	Roles, J; Yarnold, J; Hussey, K; Hankamer, B				Roles, John; Yarnold, Jennifer; Hussey, Karen; Hankamer, Ben			Techno-economic evaluation of microalgae high-density liquid fuel production at 12 international locations	BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS			English	Article						Renewable fuels; Algae-based fuel; Techno-economic analysis; Energy production; Fuel security	LIGHT; TEMPERATURE; GROWTH; PHOTOACCLIMATION; SELECTION; BIOFUELS; CAPTURE; ENERGY; MODEL; COST	Background: Microalgae-based high-density fuels offer an efficient and environmental pathway towards decarbonization of the transport sector and could be produced as part of a globally distributed network without competing with food systems for arable land. Variations in climatic and economic conditions significantly impact the economic feasibility and productivity of such fuel systems, requiring harmonized technoeconomic assessments to identify important conditions required for commercial scale up. Methods: Here, our previously validated Techno-economic and Lifecycle Analysis (TELCA) platform was extended to provide a direct performance comparison of microalgae diesel production at 12 international locations with variable climatic and economic settings. For each location, historical weather data, and jurisdiction-specific policy and economic inputs were used to simulate algal productivity, evaporation rates, harvest regime, CapEx and OpEx, interest and tax under location-specific operational parameters optimized for Minimum Diesel Selling Price (MDSP, US$ L-1). The economic feasibility, production capacity and CO2-eq emissions of a defined 500 ha algae-based diesel production facility is reported for each. Results: Under a for-profit business model, 10 of the 12 locations achieved a minimum diesel selling price (MDSP) under US$ 1.85 L-1 / US$ 6.99 gal( -1). At a fixed theoretical MDSP of US$ 2 L-1 (US$ 7.57 gal(-1)) these locations could achieve a profitable Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 9.5-22.1%. Under a public utility model (0% profit, 0% tax) eight locations delivered cost-competitive renewable diesel at an MDSP of < US$ 1.24 L-1 (US$ 4.69 gal(-1)). The CO2-eq emissions of microalgae diesel were about one-third of fossil-based diesel. Conclusions: The public utility approach could reduce the fuel price toward cost-competitiveness, providing a key step on the path to a profitable fully commercial renewable fuel industry by attracting the investment needed to advance technology and commercial biorefinery co-production options. Governments'adoption of such an approach could accelerate decarbonization, improve fuel security, and help support a local COVID-19 economic recovery. This study highlights the benefits and limitations of different factors at each location (e.g., climate, labour costs, policy, C-credits) in terms of the development of the technology-providing insights on how governments, investors and industry can drive the technology forward.

The production of green building materials is one of the key ways to decrease carbon emission. To better promote the green development of the construction industry and the realization of the decarbonization goals, a supply-chain system under technology subsidies, inclusive of a general contractor, two green building material manufacturers, is investigated. The Stackelberg model of green building material supply chain is constructed to explore how the green technology innovation of supply chain main body is affected by the technology subsidy. Meanwhile, the backward induction method is utilized to analyze the technology innovation decision-making behavior of green building material players of supply chain under a dynamic game. MATLAB software is used to simulate the stability and dynamic changes of the system in the long-term game. The results show that the decision-making stability of green building material supply chain is beneficial to the stability of supply chain system. The technology subsidy standard with reasonable policy promotes the degree of green building materials to achieve the maximum. However, once the adjustment coefficient of decision-making variables of the main body of the supply chain is large, the supply chain system will fall into chaos and disor-der through bifurcation. The delayed feedback control method thus needs to be applied to control chaos, to ensure the sustainable and healthy development of the supply chain of green building materials. This study expands the application scenario of complex system theory in construction supply chain. It also provides theo-retical guides for the government to formulate policies to encourage the promotion of green building materials.

Hydrogen production via microwave-induced water splitting at low temperature	NATURE ENERGY			English	Article							DIFFUSE-REFLECTANCE MEASUREMENTS; ELECTROCHEMICAL-CELLS; STORAGE MATERIALS; CHEMISTRY; OXYGEN; STABILITY; OXIDATION; POWER; CO2	Hydrogen is a promising vector in the decarbonization of energy systems, but more efficient and scalable synthesis is required to enable its widespread deployment. Towards that aim, Serra et al. present a microwave-based approach that allows contactless water electrolysis that can be integrated with hydrocarbon production. Supplying global energy demand with CO2-free technologies is becoming feasible thanks to the rising affordability of renewable resources. Hydrogen is a promising vector in the decarbonization of energy systems, but more efficient and scalable synthesis is required to enable its widespread deployment. Here we report contactless H-2 production via water electrolysis mediated by the microwave-triggered redox activation of solid-state ionic materials at low temperatures (<250 degrees C). Water was reduced via reaction with non-equilibrium gadolinium-doped CeO2 that was previously in situ electrochemically deoxygenated by the sole application of microwaves. The microwave-driven reduction was identified by an instantaneous electrical conductivity rise and O-2 release. This process was cyclable, whereas H-2 yield and energy efficiency were material- and power-dependent. Deoxygenation of low-energy molecules (H2O or CO2) led to the formation of energy carriers and enabled CH4 production when integrated with a Sabatier reactor. This method could be extended to other reactions such as intensified hydrocarbons synthesis or oxidation.	[Serra, J. M.; Borras-Morell, J.

J	LaMonaca, S; Ryan, L				LaMonaca, Sarah; Ryan, Lisa			The state of play in electric vehicle charging services - A review of infrastructure provision, players, and policies	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS			English	Review						Electric vehicles (EVs); Charging infrastructure; Energy policy; EV markets; Transport decarbonisation; Energy economics	RANGE ANXIETY; BUSINESS MODELS; ADOPTION; DRIVERS; IMPACT	This paper reviews the market for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure; it focuses on the types of existing charging, the main functions and actors in the market and the future policy actions required for widespread expansion. Electric vehicles represent a key technology in the mitigation of transportation greenhouse gas emissions and ambitious EV adoption targets have been set by many governments by 2030 and beyond. The rollout of EV charging infrastructure is vital in achieving this goal, as the uptake of EVs is linked to the level of coverage of EV chargers. To date, both the public and private sectors have been involved in the provision of charging stations and it is timely to consider the roles of the different actors in this market. We consider whether EV charging infrastructure is a public good or private asset and address the issues of the location of future chargers, the deployment models needed to develop, operate and own charging infrastructure, and finally the policy context for the development of charging infrastructure. We find that clear roles should be assigned to the individual public and private actors and funders, in order to achieve efficient development of the required infrastructure for large-scale EV deployment.

J	Revell, P; Dinnie, E				Revell, Philip; Dinnie, Elizabeth			Community resilience and narratives of community empowerment in Scotland	COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT JOURNAL			English	Article							ENGAGEMENT; SECURITY; POLICY	The concept of resilience is now routinely put forward by both policymakers and social activists as a way for communities to use and develop their resources and respond positively to change, including decarbonization to address climate change. The extent to which a community is able to utilize all its resources depends on the extent to which it feels empowered to take action and is a major determinant of its resilience. A narrative of community empowerment has recently emerged from Scottish Government, driven in part by the situation in Scotland, in which a skewed pattern of landownership and distant structure of 'local' democracy combine to disempower communities by disconnecting them from local resources and local representative democracy. Recent Scottish legislation appears to provide new opportunities for community groups to gain control of local assets, become more financially sustainable, undertake climate-related mitigation actions and overcome some of the current local democratic deficit. At the same time, an increasingly well-organized and networked community sector and some within the Scottish Government are actively exploring new ways to enable public participation and deliver public services. This paper analyses the current Scottish policy framework and aspirations for community empowerment and, through interviews with stakeholders, assesses the potential, this may provide for communities to become truly resilient and to actively engage with transformational change.

Assessing the Scale and Prospects of the Impact of Climate-Related Risks on Russia's Socio-Economic Development	ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CHANGES-FACTS TRENDS FORECAST			Russian	Article						climate-related risks; socio-economic development; Russia; low-carbon development; decarbonization		Global climate change is one of the most critical issues of our time. It is of vital importance to Russia, since the functioning of the country's economy to a great extant depends on natural resources, and one of the most dangerous consequences of climate change is the depletion of natural capital. In this regard, one should take an assessment of climate-related risks. The purpose of the work is a comprehensive assessment of the impact of climate-related risks on the socio-economic development of Russia. The article determines external climate-related risks expressed in the external pressure of international treaties and trade policy, pursued by foreign countries, particularly Europe, and internal risks realized through ecosystem disbalance and biodiversity loss, epidemic outbreaks and complication of their course, deterioration of infrastructure and other fundamental structures in a large part of the country. It has been established that Russia has just begun the transition to a low-carbon development, and the feature of this process compared to other countries is a comprehensive approach that involves both greenhouse gas reduction and its absorption directly from the atmospheric air. Hydrogen economy plays a key-role in emission reduction; in order to absorb greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, it is planned to form industry for their utilization through building carbon polygons and farms. We have found that measures to reduce the country's carbon footprint are now consistent and do not interfere with the interests of either business or government. However, the main issue, in our opinion, is the low rate of implementation of the measures taken relative to similar efforts of foreign countries, which to some extent gives foreign countries the opportunity, under the pretext of environmental policy, to influence the Russian economy and further hinder the Russian Federation in standing its ground in the international arena.

This includes the development of new methods along with improving and upscaling existing technologies. One example of new methods in bioenergy is developing new Miscanthus cultivars for electricity generation via thermal power station furnaces. Miscanthus is still relatively new compared with other agriculture practices, so market assessments and improvements are needed to reduce the barriers to entry for prospective growers. This publication provides a profile of UK Miscanthus growers and their businesses, their experiences of benefits and drawbacks of the crop, and what they see as potential barriers to entry for prospective farmers. A survey of current Miscanthus growers in England and Wales was conducted and indicated that most farmers were content with the crop and that its environmental and economic benefits were noted. However, it was evident that with a geographically limited UK market, growers wanted to see a better distribution of biomass processing stations to reduce the ongoing costs of transport. With growing demand for renewables, including bio-energy sources, it was determined important to provide information and support for stable farming operations and to incentivise the adoption of Miscanthus. Such incentives include ongoing development of new cultivars, focussing on traits such as production potential and stressor resilience, and growers indicated preference for an annual planting grant. These developments are predicted to further improve the crop's profit margin, making it a more cost-effective crop for farmers. Sensitively managed Miscanthus also has the potential to contribute to carbon sequestration, soil health, and aspects of farmland biodiversity. Incentivising such management in government land-based environmental schemes would offer additional income streams and help to promote environmental positive crop planting.

Most generation is secured through long-term contracts. Aggressive renewable energy programs have led to rapidly growing renewable capacity, mainly wind generation. Coal-fired generation has been eliminated and electricity sales have dropped. The competitive hourly market price has declined and there is a clear merit-order effect: an increase of wind generation from 500 MW to 1500 MW can be expected to decrease price by 7 CAD/MWh. However, the all-in price, which incorporates contractually guaranteed supply prices, has risen from about 60 to 100 CAD/MWh between 2009 and 2014. Operational and market integration of renewable resources has been achieved relatively smoothly. The procurement process is over-centralized: increased reliance on market discipline and greater separation between governmental policy makers and regulators would enhance both the efficacy and efficiency of decarbonization policies.

J	Jensen, T; Dowlatabadi, H				Jensen, Thor; Dowlatabadi, Hadi			Challenges in financing public sector low-carbon initiatives: lessons from private finance for a school district in British Columbia, Canada	CLIMATE POLICY			English	Article						Climate change mitigation; decentralized governance; energy efficiency; public finance; public-private partnerships	SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT; ENERGY EFFICIENCY; PARTNERSHIPS; POLICY; PERFORMANCE; PROCUREMENT; FACILITIES; AUSTRALIA; SERVICES; BENEFITS	Governments are major investors in climate change mitigation, but aversion to public indebtedness has led to reliance on private finance to deliver public assets. Compounding this challenge, financing through Energy Service Contracts is ruled out by accounting rules. With public and traditional private funding avenues closed, government departments have sought contracts that do not disclose the full cost of borrowing, such as the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) described in this case study. We unpack the utility contract filed with the provincial regulator to show that circumventing budgetary constraints cost the Delta School Board (DSB) 8.75% per annum on borrowed private funds while public finance would have cost 4%pa. All levels of the public sector are keen to play their role in climate mitigation. Climate policy is about not passing our burden of unbridled fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions to future generations. If we do not exempt public sector capital investments for decarbonization from deficit regulations, we risk passing an unnecessary economic burden to future generations.Key policy insights Transition to a low-carbon economy requires public sector investments that exceed budget deficit regulations and political aversion in many jurisdictions;Private-Public Partnerships are currently viewed as the solution to this self-imposed fiscal constraint;PPPs without clear performance targets or contractual templates will expose less experienced public sector investors to high costs and emissions above expectations.

However, huge investment costs and insufficient policy support are still the two main barriers to further expand renewable energy penetration. To transcend these barriers, from the perspective of both policy makers and energy suppliers, this study simultaneously integrates low-carbon policy formulations and regional integrated energy system (IES) reshaping to achieve an affordable decarbonization pathways. Mixed Integer Quadratically-Constrained Programs (MIQCP) models are constructed, and hierarchical multi -objective optimization is applied to quantify local government's decision-making costs and energy suppliers' system transition costs. A new rural community in Dalian (China) is taken as a case study to capture the relationship among energy structure adjustment, energy system reshaping, and renewable subsidy and carbon tax adjustment under different CO2 emission reduction regulations. The result shows that under the same CO2 emission reduction rate, portfolio policies can benefit both the policy maker and the energy supplier by balancing the local government revenue and expenditure, and reducing the annual total costs of IES. In addition, via IESs optimization, a higher renewable energy penetration rate could be obtained and the energy supplier could achieve a competitive cost within 40% CO2 emission reduction targets.

Plans for meeting these targets vary widely in their ambition, specificity, and time horizons. Wind and solar electricity generation will feature prominently in future energy systems that meet these renewable, low-carbon energy goals. Implementing largescale wind and solar PV infrastructure configurations in a timely fashion will require cooperation between and among electric grid stakeholders and communities that host the infrastructure. This paper presents methods for constructing a diverse range of wind and solar PV energy infrastructure pathways that meet statutory energy goals, measuring their land use impacts, and assessing their performance relative to electricity demand. A case study on the state of Vermont's statutory energy goals from its 2016 Comprehensive Energy Plan is presented as an example. While total wind and solar PV infrastructure requirements would increase several-fold, Vermont's statutory energy goals can be met while occupying less than 1% of the state's land area. Vermont electricity demand was most effectively met by balanced configurations of wind and solar PV similar to the state's present wind and solar PV resources, while 100% wind or 100% solar PV configurations were less effective.

Implementing GBs in urban areas and encouraging the use of EVs are cornerstones of transition towards SCs, and practical actions that governments can consider to help with improving the environment and develop SCs. This paper investigates different aspects of smart cities development and introduces new feasible indicators related to GBs and EVs in designing SCs, presenting existing barriers to smart cities development, and solutions to overcome them. The results demonstrate that feasible and achievable policies such as the development of the zero-energy, attention to design parameters, implementation of effective indicators for GBs and EVs, implementing strategies to reduce the cost of production of EVs whilst maintaining good quality standards, load management, and integrating EVs successfully into the electricity system, are important in smart cities development. Therefore, strategies to governments should consider the full dynamics and potential of socio-economic and climate change by implementing new energy policies on increasing investment in EVs, and GBs development by considering energy, energy, techno-economic, and environmental benefits.

RESOURCE AND ENERGY ECONOMICS			English	Article						Indirect network effects; Decarbonization; Climate policy; Electric vehicles; Hydrogen vehicles; Technology; CC_BY_4; 0	NETWORK; COMPETITION; EXTERNALITIES; ADOPTION	What factors determine whether policymakers should promote one or more technologies in a decarbonized road transport sector, and what policies should governments choose? We investigate these questions theoretically and numerically through a static, partial equili-brium model for the road transport market. We find that one important factor is how close substitutes the two vehicle technologies are. Further, the number of vehicles of one tech-nology depends on the number of vehicles of the other technology, both in the market and in the first-best solution. The first-best policy involves a subsidy of the markup on charging and filling, where the markup is higher the more utility increases with the number of stations. However, as there are several possible market equilibria, additional policies may be needed to avoid an unwanted lock-in. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Pierrehumbert, R				Pierrehumbert, Raymond			How to decarbonize? Look to Sweden	BULLETIN OF THE ATOMIC SCIENTISTS			English	Article						Global warming; climate change; decarbonization; Sweden; carbon budgets; Naomi Klein; capitalism; energy policy		Bringing global warming to a halt requires that worldwide net emissions of carbon dioxide be brought to essentially zero; the sooner this occurs, the less warming our descendants for the next 1000 years and more will need to adapt to. The widespread fear that the actions needed to bring this about conflict with economic growth is a major impediment to efforts to protect the climate. But much of this fear is pointless, and the magnitude of the task - while great - is no greater than the challenges that human ingenuity has surmounted in the past. To light the way forward, we need to examine success stories where nations have greatly reduced their carbon dioxide emissions while simultaneously maintaining vigorous growth in their standard of living; a prime example is Sweden. Through a combination of sensible government infrastructure policies and free-market incentives, Sweden has managed to successfully decarbonize, cutting its per capita emissions by a factor of 3 since the 1970s, while doubling its per capita income and providing a wide range of social benefits. This has all been accomplished within a vigorous capitalistic framework that in many ways better embodies free-market principles than the US economy. Consequently, the Swedish experience shows that solving global warming does not require us to "tear down capitalism." The world just needs to be a bit more like Sweden.

Maximising the potential for energy efficiency in the existing domestic stock is critical to the low-carbon heat transition. Good information exists on the technical potential for energy efficiency measures in the UK stock, however, a lack of knowledge about current stock conditions and in-use factors places considerable uncertainty on how much of this technical potential is achievable in practice. This study uses data from the fifth carbon budget (CB5) policy projections and updates the in-use factors using measured data from the National Energy Efficiency Database (NEED). This results in a 26% shortfall by 2035 in the anticipated energy savings through cavity, solid wall, and loft insulation compared to what is assumed in the CB5 projections. This will have costly implications for meeting future carbon budgets. Risks and policy implications are discussed. The practical potential for energy efficiency measures beyond cavity, solid wall, and loft insulation is explored.

However, determining carbon footprints is time and resource-intensive and not always possible for local governments. To meet this need, we propose an alternative method using lifecycle input-output analysis and location quotients to quantify direct and total emissions of the Mexican state of Puebla caused by its use of electricity during 2013. We quantify the emissions from the production and consumption-based perspective, finding that Puebla's economy emitted a total of 15 million metric tons of CO(2)e caused by industrial sectors' electricity use, which represented 3 % of the total national emissions caused by Mexico's industrial electricity use. The most significant contributors to Puebla's total greenhouse gas emissions were the "food and beverage preparation services" and the "business support services" sectors accounting for 38 % and 9 % of Puebla's total emissions and 50 % and 23 % of direct emissions, respectively. We conclude that, in addition to the decarbonization of the energy matrix, potential climate change mitigation policies should reduce the intensity factors of the sectors with the highest emissions identified with the proposed method.

J	Chapman, R; Boston, J				Chapman, Ralph; Boston, Jonathan			THE SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF DECARBONISING THE NEW ZEALAND ECONOMY	SOCIAL POLICY JOURNAL OF NEW ZEALAND			English	Article								There is strong evidence that the mean surface temperature of the Earth has risen significantly since 1900. Recent evidence suggests that, if warming of more than 2 C (above pre-industrial levels) is to be avoided, then the emissions of greenhouse gases by developed countries, like New Zealand, may need to fall by up to 70% by 2030 and 90% by 2030. Achieving such a rapid decarbonisation will require major changes in energy generation, transport fuels and behaviour, land use and urban design, underpinned by modifications to national policy frameworks, and changes in social attitudes and behaviour. This paper outlines the case for rapid decarbonisation, assesses the implications for New Zealand's economy and society, discusses the required policy changes and the likely economic and distributional Impacts of such changes, and explores institutional factors influencing policy development and implementation The paper draws on recent international and domestic studies of the likely economic and distributional impacts of policy measures to mitigate climate change. It also refers to some survey evidence concerning public attitudes towards climate change and the willingness of citizens to change their behaviour and support policy measures to reduce emissions.

J	Lee, H				Lee, Heewon			Private Sector Engagement in the Self-Governance of Urban Sustainable Infrastructure: A Study on Alternative Fueling Infrastructure in the United States	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						alternative fuel governance; private sector engagement; sustainable urban infrastructure; alternative fueling stations	VOLUNTARY ENVIRONMENTAL-PROGRAMS; COLLABORATIVE GOVERNANCE; COLLECTIVE ACTION; POLICY NETWORKS; PARTNERSHIPS; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK; VEHICLES; LESSONS; SUCCESS	Greenhouse gas emission reduction and decarbonization goals drive citizens' interests in alternative fuel vehicles and have created fast-growing demands on alternative fuels. While governments are promoting the transition to alternative fuel vehicles, the lack of refueling and recharging infrastructure for the vehicles is a key barrier to the adoption. At the same time, the public sector cannot solely provide needed alternative fueling infrastructure due to limited financial resources. Consequently, governments in the U.S. have been working on facilitating the private sector's investment in alternative fueling infrastructure. The most common approach was financial incentive programs and policies, but the U.S. also promotes self-organized collaborative governance of alternative fuels across sectors at the local level. This paper asks whether these two approaches stimulate the private sector's engagement in providing alternative fueling infrastructure. This study uses the case of the Clean Cities program that targets the reduction in petroleum usage, adoption of alternative fuels and creation of self-governance at the local level. Local private businesses, local government agencies and non-profit organizations voluntarily participate in the local transition to alternative fuels. Therefore, this governance aims at facilitating more sustainable actions and business choices in the private sector. This paper tests the hypotheses of whether the local self-governance of Clean Cities increases privately-owned alternative fueling infrastructure using panel fixed-effects Poisson regression models. Based on the data of counties in 12 states from 2004 to 2015, the results of empirical analysis suggest that both self-governance and financial incentive programs are effective in increasing the engagement of private actors in providing alternative fueling infrastructure.

Thus, decarbonising urban mobility is critical in the endeavours to mitigate climate change. Electric vehicles (EV) have potential to control global decarbonisation of transportation. India has air quality index of 141, which is amongst the highest in the world. Considering this troubling figure, government has initiated various schemes and initiative plans. This study reviews the progress and current status of EV adoption in India with regard to availability, manufacturing, charging infrastructure, commercial vehicle electrification and in-depth analysis of FAME-I and FAME-II schemes along with state level initiatives. This research explores the current state of EV adoption through the integrative perspective of financial resources, infrastructure and technology availability highlighting various complications. Based on these challenges, the study proposes points of improvment in each fragment such as policies, infrastructure,electricity demand and sustainable source of energy. A roadmap is recommended of primary factors that should be priortised for effective EV adoption.

This study aims to provide solutions for dealing with carbon emissions from the transportation of the SREB in the Chinese range. By employing the Malmquist index method of data envelopment analysis (DEA), this study develops models to test the different carbon-reduction performances (CRP) of transportation in the Chinese provinces along the SREB. This study shows that carbon-reduction performance has improved since 2013 because of the improvements in transportation technology. Technical efficiency, including scale efficiency and pure technological efficiency, may improve carbon reduction, while the lagged technological progress restricts the CRP. It is further suggested that the provincial CRPs are different. The southwest provinces have the best decarbonization performance, followed by the northwest, while the northeast provinces, including Inner Mongolia, underperform compared to the others. Therefore, the government should release some technology-orientated policies as soon as possible to facilitate the improvements in technical efficiency and progress in transportation vehicles and infrastructures in order to consequently reduce carbon emissions.

Like many other countries, it shows a marked discrepancy between official government policies and commitments on decarbonisation, and actual progress in reducing reliance on coal. Several factors suggest nonetheless that South Africa (like many fossil fuel-dependent Global South countries) would benefit from a more rapid transition to RE sources: these include (1) the unreliability of coal, its fossil fuel-based power supply, constituting a major brake on economic development, particularly for rural areas where the infrastructure is lacking; (2) this supply's associated pollution, which has a serious impact on local and regional health and well-being; (3) South Africa's superior clean-energy endowments; and, not least; and (4) "resource curse" effects of coal (and the broader mining economy). For many years, price has not been a plausible explanation for the relative tardiness of South Africa's energy transition, nor the exclusive determining factor. Rather, explanations need to refer to the country's broader political (including international and global) contexts.

Meeting this challenge of providing abundant, clean energy undoubtedly requires synergistic efforts between basic and applied researchers in the chemical sciences to develop and deploy new technologies. Among the available options, solar energy is one of the promising targets because of the high abundance of solar photons over much of the globe. Similarly, decarbonization of the global energy supply will require clean sources of hydrogen to use as reducing equivalents for fuel and chemical feedstocks. In this report, we discuss the importance of translational research-defined as work that explicitly targets basic discovery as well as technology development-in the context of photovoltaics and solar fuels. We focus on three representative research programs encompassing translational research in government, industry, and academia. We then discuss more broadly the benefits and challenges of translational research models and offer recommendations for research programs that address societal challenges in the energy sector and beyond.

The study bases on national level and conducts a four-scenario analysis, including Reference Scenario (REF), Deep Decarbonization Pathway Scenario (DDP), End-of-Pipe Control Scenario (EPC), and Co-Control Scenario (COC). By applying China-MAPLE model and CV method, the study calculates the future emissions of air pollutants in China and its health damage. Results show that in COC scenario, the emissions of SO2, NOx and PM2.5 will drop to 1.76, 8.43 and 6.43 million tons respectively in 2030, and the economic losses caused by PM-SO2, PM-NOx and PM2.5 emissions are 0.159 %, 0.025% and 1.604% of China's 2010 GDP respectively, and in 2050, the proportions drop to 0.098%, 0.014% and 1.128%. The results provide a reference for the government to formulate policy. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

How to reduce carbon emissions has become an important issue for governments and academics. Although previous researchers have discussed the factors of carbon emission reduction from environmental regulation, economic development, and industrial structure, limited studies have explored the carbon emission reduction effect of a city's spatial structure. Based on 108 Chinese cities from the Yangtze River Economic Belt between 2003 and 2017, this paper examines the impact of the city cluster policy on city carbon emissions using the difference-in-differences (DID) method. We find that: (1) The city cluster policy has significantly reduced the cities' carbon emissions by 7.4%. Furthermore, after a series of robust and endogenous tests, such as parallel trend and PSM-DID, the core conclusion still remains. (2) We further identify possible economic channels through this effect, and find that city cluster policy would increase city productivity, city technological innovation, and industrial structure optimization. The conclusions of this paper have important practical significance for China to achieve carbon neutrality and facilitate future deep decarbonization.

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the interaction between geopolitical risk (GPR) and carbon dioxide (CO2) in China. This paper uses the recently developed GPR index and a bootstrap Granger rolling-window estimation. Empirical results spanning different subsamples reveal a two-way causal relationship between GPR and CO2. GPR transforms energy consumption and economic activities through trade disputes, military deployments and energy issues, which have a complex impact on CO2 emissions. Oppositely, CO2 emissions affect GPR through changes in international cooperation and shaping of geopolitical systems. In view of these empirical results, we put forward several policy recommendations. The Chinese government can effectively consider GPR to control CO2 emissions by increasing green investment and signing environmental contracts. Enterprises must focus on research and development (R&D) and investment in new energy innovations. In addition, international organizations can be a useful tool for monitoring decarbonization policies and resolving conflicts between countries.

The presented study aims to contribute to this by analysing one of the proposed solutions: power-to-gas. A techno-economic model is created for the purposes of evaluating specific projects on their feasibility in terms of local constraints and opportunities, using a current project as a template for model generation and analysing different possible configurations in 8 operational scenarios. Five metrics were used for scenario analysis: levelized cost of methane, minimum selling price, operational hours, hydrogen tank size and capital cost. The results from the analysis indicate that, in terms of the stated project, synthetic natural gas production and grid injection along with on-site mobility applications provide the best economical result. However, selling prices of synthetic natural gas obtained are one magnitude higher than current natural gas prices, indicating government support is required for further development. Future projections of electrolyser efficiency and equipment capital costs will greatly reduce production costs, giving promise for feasible business cases in the coming years.

The government has deployed Three Red Lines (TRLs) to improve water security by 2030 and committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2060. China's industries, which account for half of national CO2 emissions and >20% water withdrawals, is key to decarbonization and water conservation. However, there remains a lack of consensus regarding whether industrial emission reduction and water saving can be achieved simultaneously. Here, we adopt a general equilibrium model using a self-developed high-resolution provincial water-use inventory based on enterprise census data, to uncover the impacts achieving carbon neutrality would have on industrial water use across China. Meeting carbon neutrality enables the achievement of the TRL-associated industrial water-use target and can reduce industrial water use by 24% in 2060. Nevertheless, if inter-provincial industrial relocation occurs, water use could rise in certain provinces, reducing the above water-saving potential. Stricter and coordinated policies and technological advancements are essential to successfully address climate and water challenges concurrently.

This paper examines how people with little previous exposure to CCS technology, frame and discuss it, and how in the absence of information, ideas, notions, values and experiences shape opinion. We present data from a series of focus groups held with environmental activists, planning councillors, and adult and youth community group members in London in 2012. We found that views on CCS are shaped strongly by wider factors, particularly trade offs between different energy futures. Lay-critiques were similar to those put forward by environmental groups and were strongly framed by conceptions of nuclear power. We argue that although there is little public disquiet concerning this technology in private opinions were generally negative. This, and the use of nuclear power as a framing device, may present a challenge to policymakers and industry committed to implementing CCS while promoting education as the main mechanism for public acceptance.

The main reasons for this push are efforts to reduce air and noise pollution thus creating a more attractive cities for residents and tourist whilst also reducing greenhouse gases (GHGs). Transport electrification is one of the popular trends and is a key pillar for achieving decarbonization. In emerging cities, less incentives are considered to examine how they influence consumers' behavior. This article aims at considering the effects of policy measures in terms of financial incentives. A binary regression model was used to evaluate consumer's decision. 700 individuals were invited to participate in the survey to reflect their different preferences and 633 samples were selected for further analysis. The results identified that perception of the government incentives like tax and fees incentives, loan incentives, and electric price reduction can significantly impact electric motorcycle adoption behavior. The results of surveys may serve as initial advance for transport authorities and electric vehicle manufactures in promoting electric mobility in motorcycle (MC) dominated emerging cities.

Adopting public policies has encouraged circular approaches such as the waste to energy (WtE). Anaerobic digestion (AD) has been the most studied WtE strategy to help to reach the objectives in the agriculture sector. The swine waste represents an essential source of energy that can be converted into biogas by this treatment. The multiplicity of uses of the AD product (biogas) is strongly related to the environmental viability of the adopted technology. Hence, this study evaluates the environmental viability of five treatment biogas plants using residues from Brazilian swine production through a life cycle assessment (LCA), comparing the generation of electricity and biomethane as critical paths to promote change in the national energy matrix and increase decarbonization in the agricultural sector. Based on the results, both strategies prove to be environmentally favourable for mitigating environmental impacts caused during waste handling. Electricity generation can mitigate 100% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, while biomethane production mitigates up to 114% of GHG emissions.

It's an export crop and its production is in the hands of small producers. The management of this crop at the farm level is compatible with the biodiversity, decarbonization and bioeconomy policies and strategies promoted by the country's government authorities. In particular, this work presents crop diversification alternatives to support the reduction of deforestation, forest management and conservation, reforestation and the promotion of agroforestry systems (SAF). It also has an impact on the conservation of biodiversity, water, scenic beauty values in the rural landscape and stimulates the economy. The problem being addressed is the lack of scientific and technological knowledge on the aspects related to the abaca cultivation, including agroforestry systems with commercially valuable timber species, as well as the characterization of the fiber to propose new uses and add greater value to the export product and open up new ventures at the national level.

While the EU is setting an ambitious goal of decarbonising its energy system by 2050, Poland remains a member opposing those changes. Although most Poles declare their understanding of the necessity of decarbonisation and support for that process, both current and former governments have not treated this problem as a sufficient stimulus to a substantial energy policy change. Using the lens of Sociotechnical Imaginaries (Jasanoff, Kim, 2015), we explain that resistance to implementing fast changes into the Polish energy system is founded on the complex set of shared imaginaries linked to policy, scientific and lay knowledge. Based on a qualitative analysis of strategic documents of the energy policy in Poland published after 1989, the interviews with key actors in the energy sector, and analysis of government funding programmes for science, we mapped the dominant and alternative SIs of the energy transition in Poland. The analytical framework was based on a sociotechnical imaginaries circulation model used to explain their actions in the Polish energy transition. The study's outcome shows that the dominant SI of an energy system in Poland relates to the preservation of the existing system focused on energy security, a significant role of hard coal and lignite, and prosumers as supporters for the centralised energy system. The alternative imaginaries (associated with decentralisation, energy democracy and renewables) are getting traction and becoming more important.

Sustainable Development and Digitalization: The Unusual COVID-19 Crisis Requires Original Solutions	VESTNIK MEZHDUNARODNYKH ORGANIZATSII-INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS RESEARCH JOURNAL			Russian	Article						Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); Agenda 2030; digitalization; COVID-19 pandemic; anti-crisis policy	DEVELOPMENT GOALS; SDGS	This article provides a content analysis of over 20 policy proposals for coping with the COVID-19 crisis that have been published by influential international organizations, governments, corporations, academics and civil society groups. The current situation, the role of digitalization during the crisis, and the composition of anti-crisis measures already taken by the world's largest economies are investigated, and long-term measures are proposed aimed at restoring the global economy and moving toward more equitable and sustainable development. The authors identify a significant green component in public policy proposals published since the pandemic began and note that many proposals relate to equity and inclusiveness in development and meeting the needs of individuals. The authors further identify key areas of sustainable development that require action in the near future and which can create new opportunities for economic development: renewable energy and clean transport, cyclical economy, digitalization and environmental protection. At the same time, it is noted that the transition to a green economy is of a long-term nature and may conflict with the need in the short term to support the economy in overcoming the crisis. These priority areas for government action require attention within the framework of Russia's anti-crisis policy. Given the sharp drop in oil prices, the acceleration of digitalization and decarbonization, and the magnitude of the 2020 economic crisis, Russia needs to begin an accelerated transition	[Lanshina, T.; Barinova, V] Russian Acad Natl Econ & Publ Adm President Russi, Ctr Econ Modeling Energy & Ecol, Prosp Vernadsky 82,Bldg 1, Moscow 119571, Russia; [Kondratyev, A.] Natl Res Univ, Natl Res Univ MPEI, Dept Power Supply Ind Enterprises & Electrotechno, Inst Elect Engn & Electrificat, Krasnokazarmennaya St,House 14, Moscow 115432, Russia; [Kondratyev, A.; Romantsov, M.] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Management, Dept Sustainable Dev Econ, 2nd Kozhukhovsky Proezd 12,Bldg 1, Moscow 115432, Russia	Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy & Public Administration; Moscow Power Engineering Institute; Lomonosov Moscow State University	Lanshina, T (corresponding author), Russian Acad Natl Econ & Publ Adm President Russi, Ctr Econ Modeling Energy & Ecol, Prosp Vernadsky 82,Bldg 1, Moscow 119571, Russia.	lanshina@ranepa.ru; barinova@ranepa.ru; kdg040598@gmail.com	Lanshina, Tatiana/AAJ-1594-2021; Barinova, Vera/AAH-4530-2021						39	1	1	4	20	NATL RESEARCH UNIV HIGHER SCH ECONOMICS	MOSCOW	SHABOLOVKA, 26, MOSCOW, 119049, RUSSIA	1996-7845			VESTN MEZHDUNARODNYK	Vestn.

Goals, challenges and lessons learnt from these operations are also reported. The data and assessments presented are based on a literature review of government reports, academic articles, online resources, news outlets and interviews conducted with personnel of Antarctic stations. As of 2021, 29 facilities have incorporated renewables in their energy systems, but only one permanent and four summer stations use renewables to meet more than 50% of their energy needs. Four main goals behind the development of renewable energy systems have been identified: fuel cost savings; reduction of the greenhouse gas emissions footprint in alignment with national decarbonization targets; electricity supply for scientific equipment during the winter months; and the development and/or testing of new technologies. The extreme weather conditions and complex logistics of Antarctica put both solar and wind systems under huge stress, which generates operational, technological and budgetary challenges that are also explored in this work.

Bibliometric analysis of the research landscape on rice husks gasification (1995-2019)	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Review						Biomass; VOSViewer; Web of Science; Techno-economic analysis; Sustainable development goals; Carbon capture; Carbon nanomaterials	SUPERCRITICAL WATER GASIFICATION; BIOMASS GASIFICATION; POWER-GENERATION; CARBON NANOMATERIALS; WASTE BIOMASS; OPERATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; ELECTRICITY-GENERATION; STEAM GASIFICATION; EXERGY ANALYSIS	The processing of rice (Oryza sativa L.) generates large quantities of lignocellulosic wastes termed rice husks (RH). Numerous researchers have proposed biomass gasification as the panacea to the waste disposal and management challenges posed by RH. However, a comprehensive analysis of RH gasification is required to examine the research landscape and future directions on the area. The research landscape and global developments on RH gasification from 1995 to 2019 are examined through bibliometric analysis of 228 publications extracted from the Web of Science. Bioresource Technology is considered the most influential journal on the topic, whereas China is the most productive nation due to government policies and research funding. The most productive organization is the Harbin Institute of Technology, which is due to the significant contributions of Zhao YiJun and co-workers. Keyword analysis revealed three crucial research themes: gasification, biomass, and rice husks. The literature revealed that the syngas yield, distribution, and performance of RH gasification are significantly influenced by temperature, equivalence ratio, selected reactor, and gasifying medium. The techno-economic analysis of RH gasification revealed that government interventions such as high sales rates and low investment costs could enhance the commercial viability of the technology. Furthermore, the integration of RH gasification with carbon capture utilization and storage could promote the decarbonization of power plants, negative emissions, and net-zero climate goals. Overall, the paper provides valuable information for future researchers to identify strategic collaborators, journal publications, and research frontiers yet unexplored.

It explores the role that Bavaria - as an economically- and politically-powerful German state, with distinct administrative characteristics and a commanding auto-industry - has had in driving both innovation in the region and influencing the policy processes at a supra-national level. Utilising notions from institutional interplay, social-political and cross-disciplinary governance, it demonstrates the complexities in multi-level, multi-actor governance by exploring the interactions between diverse stakeholders and the tensions between multi-level policy mixes. Decarbonisation is a pressing problem to which there are high expectations to find solutions, but certain institutional challenges are hindering progress toward achieving this aim. Fostering innovation is a priority for the Bavarian government, ensuring that the auto-industry continues to deliver economic prosperity and a competitive edge in technological development. This article explores how Bavaria navigated the need to preserve economic development and to reduce emissions from the car industry through influencing the Cars and CO2 negotiations at the European level.

Carbon mitigation unit costs of building retrofits and the scope for carbon tax, a case study	ENERGY AND BUILDINGS			English	Article						Low carbon heating; Energy supply decarbonisation; Building retrofit; Market and policy uncertainty; Carbon tax	ENERGY RETROFITS; COMBINED HEAT; EFFICIENCY; EMISSIONS	Energy and environmental data is collected from 5 tower blocks each containing 90 apartments to create two representative calibrated energy models. Three towers (heated by individual natural gas boilers) characterise medium (137.3 kWh/m(2)/yr.) and two (heated by electrical night storage heaters) characterise low (75.4 kWh/m(2)/yr.) thermal demands when benchmarked against actual UK domestic portfolio. Across 2020-2040 time horizon, an uncertain landscape is represented by 12 fuel carbon intensity and 14 economic scenarios in order to examine building fabric upgrade, without or in conjunction with centralised CHP engines, GSHP and biomass boilers in the case study towers. Out of 18 retrofit options examined, 7 or 8 solutions (under annual fuel price rises of 2% or 5.2% respectively) can provide lifetime CO(2)e mitigation at unit costs that fall below the upper bounds of carbon capture and storage technologies (US$143/tCO(2)e). If carbon taxation were to be used to enable full recovery of retrofit capital expenditure with no government subsidy, the lowest tax level observed belongs to a transition to centralised biomass from decentralised natural gas boilers requiring US$111/tCO(2)e (in 2020), while deep retrofits (i.e. plant and fabric) require much more punishing carbon taxes with 2020 figures ranging from US$233/tCO(2)e to US$1665/tCO(2)e.

Yet due to trenchant political economic risks, reform attempts can be fraught for governments. Despite these concerns, an institutionally and economically diverse group of states included references to fossil fuel subsidy reform (FFSR) in their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) under the Paris Agreement. What conditions might explain why some states reference politically risky reforms within treaty commitments, while most others would not? We argue that the Article 4 process under the Paris Agreement creates a "credibility dilemma" for states-articulating ambitious emissions reduction targets while also defining national climate plans engenders a need to seek out appropriate policy ideas that can justify overarching goals to international audiences. Insomuch as particular norms are institutionalized and made salient in international politics, a window of opportunity is opened: issue advocates can "activate" norms by demonstrating how related policies can make commitments credible. Using mixed methods, we find support for this argument. We identify contextual factors advancing FFSR in the lead-up to the Paris Agreement, including norm institutionalization in regimes and international organization programs as well as salience-boosting climate diplomacy. Further, we find correspondences between countries targeted by transnational policy advocates and FFSR references in INDCs, building on the momentum in international politics more generally. Though drafting INDCs and NDCs is a government-owned process, the results suggest that understanding their content requires examining international norms alongside domestic circumstances.

J	Da Rimini, F; Goodman, J; Swarnakar, P; Yla-Anttila, T				Da Rimini, Francesca; Goodman, James; Swarnakar, Pradip; Yla-Anttila, Tuomas			Climate Policy Networks in Australia: Dynamics of Failure and Possibility	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND HISTORY			English	Article							POLITICS; INDUSTRY	Many high-income countries are committed to effective climate policy, yet remain heavily dependent on fossil fuel extraction. The contradiction between an intensifying climate crisis and continued policy failure generates new political alignments, constituencies, and agendas. A dialectical process of socio-ecological change opens-up, where the climate is "socialised" and society is "climatised". Australia is a high-income, high-emitting fossil fuel "superpower" with a thirty-year stretch of failing climate policy, and offers an exceptionally vivid illustration of this dynamic. The paper explores these themes through the rhetoric of participants in Australian climate policy networks. It is based on sustained involvement the field and a series of in-depth interviews with organisations that seek to influence Australian climate policy, across business associations, trade unions, environmental non-governmental organisations, government agencies, and think tanks. It finds extensive strategic reflection across these organisations, with moves to more collaboration and alliance-building to isolate the fossil fuel lobby, and efforts at creating new constituencies to advance decarbonisation "on the ground".

Energy systems optimisation modelling (ESOM) is a widely used tool to inform pathways to address long-term energy challenges. This article describes a new ESOM developed to inform Ireland's energy system decarbonisation challenge. The TIMES-Ireland Model (TIM) is an optimisation model of the Irish energy system, which calculates the cost-optimal fuel and technology mix to meet future energy service demands in the transport, buildings, industry, and agriculture sectors, while respecting constraints in greenhouse gas emissions, primary energy resources, and feasible deployment rates. TIM is developed to take into account Ireland's unique energy system context, including a very high potential for offshore wind energy and the challenge of integrating this on a relatively isolated grid, a very ambitious decarbonisation target in the period to 2030, the policy need to inform 5-year carbon budgets to meet policy targets, and the challenge of decarbonising heat in the context of low building stock thermal efficiency and high reliance on fossil fuels. To that end, model features of note include future-proofing with flexible temporal and spatial definitions, with a possible hourly time resolution, unit commitment and capacity expansion features in the power sector, residential and passenger transport under- pinned by detailed bottom-up sectoral models, cross-model harmonisation, and soft-linking with demand and macro models. The paper also outlines a priority list of future model developments to better meet the challenge of deeply decarbonising energy supply and demand, taking into account the equity, cost-effectiveness, and technical feasibility.

Carbon footprint impacts of banning cars with internal combustion engines	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Internal combustion engines; Electric cars; Vehicle fleet turnover; Climate change mitigation; Carbon footprints; Prospective lifecycle assessment	BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES; LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; EMISSIONS; BIOENERGY; FUEL; TRANSPORTATION; ELECTROFUELS; TECHNOLOGY; INTENSITY; BIOFUELS	Banning sales of passenger cars with internal combustion engines is becoming a common climate change mitigation policy. This study analyzes the effects of such a ban on the carbon footprints of passenger car travel in Sweden using a novel vehicle turnover model and prospective lifecycle assessment, with scenarios for decarbonization of supply chains. A ban on internal combustion engines results in significantly decreased carbon footprints primarily due to reduced tailpipe CO2 emissions. The full effect of a ban is delayed due to fleet inertia. Increasing the pace of electrification is beneficial for the carbon footprint regardless of global manufacturing decarbonization pathways. A ban in 2030 is not sufficient to reach national policy targets for the transport sector, requiring either an earlier ban (i.e., 2025) or increased biofuel use. Risks of carbon leakage may motivate extending current regulations of vehicle-specific tailpipe emissions to also cover carbon footprints for new cars.

ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Total cost of ownership; Electric vehicles; GHG emissions; CO2 emissions; Transport decarbonisation; Life cycle costs	TOTAL-COST; POLICY MEASURES; ROAD TRANSPORT; INCENTIVES; OWNERSHIP; HYBRID; PURCHASE; US; MOBILITY; ADOPTION	We analyse the total cost of ownership of petrol, diesel, hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles in the UK over 2017-2029. We do this for large, medium and small cars, under assumptions of 0%, 6%, 30% and 60% discount rates. We find that some electric car models from mass market brands are close to reaching cost parity with their petrol, diesel and hybrid counterparts, but subsidies would accelerate their uptake, especially for impatient consumers with high discount rates. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are not worth the effort because, although relatively low, their CO2 emissions are non-zero, and their purchase price is as high or even higher than that of battery electric vehicles. A subsidy of 4,500 pound or an exemption from the 20% VAT, perhaps capped at 4,500 pound, would accelerate mass market penetration of battery electric vehicles in the UK. If decarbonising road transport were not as urgent as it is, the market for battery electric vehicles could be left to develop on its own, without government intervention. However, because the cost of batteries is not falling fast enough, subsidies are needed in the short term.

A comparative review of municipal energy business models in Germany, California, and Great Britain: Institutional context and forms of energy decentralization	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS			English	Review						Municipal utilities; Energy decentralization; Policy; Market design; Business models; Distributed energy resources	COMMUNITY RENEWABLE ENERGY; SUSTAINABLE ENERGY; ELECTRICITY; INNOVATION; POLICY; MARKET; POLITICS; POWER; TRANSITIONS; SYSTEMS	There is widespread agreement in policy and academic circles that energy systems in many jurisdictions are becoming more decentralized. Energy decentralization may be occurring among US and European municipal governments as they establish energy companies to serve customers and promote energy sector decarbonization. This paper reviews different forms of energy decentralization identified in the literature. It then reviews and compares municipal energy company development and activity in three jurisdictions with different legal and regulatory frameworks. Differences in institutional context, we argue, explain much of the variation in municipal energy business models and, by extension, the ways in which energy decentralization is occurring. Specifically, we show that the opportunity to take on monopoly functions where municipal companies are not competing with other market players, and thereby face fewer financial and operational risks, enable municipal energy companies to promote energy decentralization in business activities. On the contrary, these opportunities are limited where municipal energy companies must compete in markets with other players. The findings confirm that public policy institutions play a critical role in energy decentralization and demonstrate how studying commercial activities through a business model lens can help reveal decentralization dynamics. The results are also intended for cities considering new municipal ventures, especially where cities are trying to learn lessons from international examples. They suggest an explicit consideration of differences in policy and regulatory contexts.

From a policy perspective, current and projected growth in aviation is fundamentally incompatible with radical emissions reduction and decarbonisation of the global energy system. Efforts to address the aviation-climate change 'policy clash' must be informed by an understanding of public sentiments towards climate change, air travel and carbon mitigation. This article examines how consumers across four western nations are responding to the environmental excesses of contemporary air travel consumption. It focuses on individual receptiveness to voluntarily measures aimed at changing flying behaviours, industry responses and degrees of government regulation. Its theoretical context harnesses lessons from public health to inform a discussion of bottom up (social marketing, nudge) and top down (government regulation) approaches to the urgent challenge of radical air travel emissions reduction. The findings of its comparative empirical analysis are presented, based upon 68 in-depth interviews conducted in Norway, the United Kingdom, Germany and Australia. We highlight contrasts in how consumers are beginning to internalise and process the environmental excesses of contemporary air travel consumption. Whereas voluntary measures, such as carbon offsetting, are viewed with widespread scepticism, divergence was found across the four study, contexts in willingness to accept regulatory measures. Norwegians were far more willing to accommodate strong government intervention through taxation, whereas participants from the other three nations favoured softer strategies that are not perceived as restricting individual freedoms to travel. We conclude that voluntary approaches will be insufficient alone, and that behavioural change in public flying behaviour requires diverse policy measures. These must be informed by insights into the public's willingness to palate stronger mitigation interventions, which varies within and between societies. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In parallel, there has been an increasing social awareness regarding decarbonization and renewable promotion. Most of governments have then included new policies and financing for renewable integration into different sector. In fact, the deployment of technologies based on renewable energies for the generation of electricity is a key factor in the current energy transformation. It is estimated to add approximately 305 GW per year between 2021 and 2026 to the global capacity of renewable generation electricity. Among the different resources, the wind sector participation, both onshore and offshore, plays a crucial role in the generation of electricity from renewables; expecting that, by the year 2050, there will be more than 6,000 GW of installed global capacity. However, the useful life of many wind power plants is coming to the end. Subsequently, many national power systems will be faced in the coming years with the decision to repower or partially or totally dismantle their wind turbines. This work proposes an updated methodology to determine the feasibility of repowering wind installations. A complex network of factors usually considered in decision-making processes are selected: climatic, technological, environmental, social and economic. These factors are then analyzed and optimized under different multicriteria evaluation method approaches.

J	Adkin, L				Adkin, Laurie			CROSSROADS IN ALBERTA: CLIMATE CAPITALISM OR ECOLOGICAL DEMOCRACY?	SOCIALIST STUDIES			English	Article						Fossil capitalism; neoliberal globalization; Alberta; ecological democracy; climate change; climate capitalism; decarbonization		In this article I outline two divergent visions of a post-carbon future which I label 'climate capitalism' and 'ecological democracy.' These models are necessarily simplified and incomplete, serving as rough ideal types that can help us make sense of policy choices with regard to climate change as decisions laying the foundations of our future societal development. Decisions taken now direct us along one path, often making other directions more obscure, inaccessible, or unthinkable. The outcome of each junction in the interplay of social forces opens and forecloses future possibilities for action within a given time frame. Some outcomes are easily overturned, others are 'definitive' for a generation or more. In the context of global warming and related ecological crises, what we humans choose to do within the next ten years can be expected to have irreversible consequences for many future generations. Notwithstanding the potential for capitalists to invent and commodify new 'post-carbon' technologies or to invent eco-system service-based commodities, questions are posed about the ecological sustainability of a mode of production that relies upon ever-expanding growth in material and energy through-puts. Is capitalism, ultimately, unthinkable in a steady-state system of production and consumption? Can capitalism dematerialize while wage-labour continues to define the mode of production? Or, as many in the global climate justice movement believe, will a just solution to global warming require far-reaching transformations of the global capitalist economic and social order? Will the properties of the renewable energy technologies that we are currently able to envisage (solar, wind, geothermal, tidal, hydro-electric, conservation, etc.) resist monopoly ownership and control and underpin more decentralized and democratic communities? These are questions with which the left is grappling in every context, including in Alberta, where an unprecedented opportunity for change opened up with the election of the New Democratic Party in May 2015 following many decades of government by conservative parties. In the first part of this article I outline, in general terms, emerging post-carbon visions or models of development. In the second part, I shift the focus of analysis to the observable sign-posts and possibilities for post-carbon transition in the Alberta context.

A review of renewable energy practices in the Australian mining industry	RENEWABLE ENERGY			English	Review						Power purchase agreement; System analysis; Battery storage; Drivers; Barriers; Decarbonisation		Mining companies have increasingly shown interest in renewable electricity generation to address rising energy costs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from their operations. Yet, the extent to which renewable energy sources are currently adopted by these companies is unknown. This work quantifies and characterises the current level of renewable energy adoption by Australian mining houses and the evolution of renewable energy technology adoption in this industry over time. Moreover, this work contributes to an increased understanding of factors driving or inhibiting the adoption of renewable energy in mining. In 2021, only 7% of the existing mines had or were planning to have a renewable energy system. Of the total renewable energy systems identified in this analysis, 15 were operational, 2 were under construction and 10 have been announced and planned for possible future deployment. The analysis of historical changes in renewable energy technology has highlighted that 70% of the existing operational systems have only been installed since 2019. The characteristics of the mines highly affect the decision to deploy renewable energy systems. 70% of the renewable energy systems analysed in this study were or are planned to be deployed on-site at off-grid mines powered by diesel and/or gas. Solar photovoltaic is the preferred renewable energy technology for mining operations, installed or proposed for 92% of the 27 projects included in this study. By providing a detailed picture of past and current trends of renewable energy adoption, this study identifies weaknesses and points of intervention in the emerging market for renewables in mining. In doing so, it offers guidance to policy and decision makers for the development of informed solutions to increase renewable energy uptake in mining.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

LOCAL ECONOMY			English	Article						Computable general equilibrium models; carbon capture; CO2 transport and storage; economy-wide impacts; employment multipliers; industrial decarbonisation; new industry development; regional industry clusters	CGE; CCS; IMPACTS; MODELS; POLICY	In 2021, the UK Government commenced a 'cluster sequencing' initiative to identify early movers in delivering carbon transport and storage (T&S) services to proximate regional industry clusters with capture potential. A Scottish proposition focussed primarily on linking the Grangemouth industry cluster to North Sea storage, and the potential to transition Oil and Gas industry capacity to deliver CO2 T&S has devolved policy support. This is in terms of potential to transition and create new direct industry and supply chain jobs, set against risks of displacing jobs in different sectors and regions of the UK. We introduce a Scottish CO2 T&S industry to a UK multi-sector economy-wide model, assessing the extent of potential expansion and job creation in the presence of supply-side and funding constraints. We find that large employment 'multiplier' gains registered in previous studies only apply over the very long term and in the absence of such constraints. Crucially, any need to recover demands on the public purse via socialisation of costs severely constrains possible gains, while imposing 'polluter pays' leads to net economy-wide contractions triggered by competitiveness losses concentrated in Scottish cluster industries, leading to offshoring of production and jobs, potentially skewed within the localities hosting the clusters.

This work determines the theoretical potential of industrial waste heat and solar thermal power within the cities' boundaries and in relation to the cities' district heating systems. A prognosis for the year 2030 and 2050 will be given. Poor information about industrial waste heat is bypassed by taking industrial emission from the dehst and by calculating the overall installed energy by stoichiometry. 10 %, 20 %, 30 % of the so calculated primary energy input is assumed to be meaningful integrable waste heat. The potential of solar thermal power is estimated by the solar fraction that is given with 1 %, 5 % and 15 %. The results show a high, currently unused potential of industrial waste heat sources and solar thermal power for the integration into district heating. In some cities, these energy sources can supply the heat demand of the city's district heating system completely. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Yet scholars have struggled to measure the political behavior of multinational firms due to lack of transparency about their activities and inconsistency in reporting requirements across jurisdictions. In this research note, we present a new data source-firms' earnings calls-that scholars might use to better understand the political behavior of major multinational polluters. To illustrate the value of earnings calls as a data source, we construct an original data set of all earnings calls made between 2005 and 2019 by major oil and gas firms. We then code these transcripts, demonstrating that although firms can be classified as more or less pro-climate, there is little evidence of the industry's public acceptance of decarbonization. These unique data could permit researchers to explore important questions about climate politics, the evolution of private governance, and the relationship between policy and firms' political behavior. Moreover, we suggest extensions of our approach, including other multinational industries that are amenable to this type of analysis.

Recent studies have shown that wind power is one of the most promising renewable energy option in China. Although many studies have estimated the generation potential of onshore wind power, their results vary widely from 1783 TWh to 39,000 TWh. Therefore, we examine the different assumptions in these papers and identify three main factors influencing the results. The three influencing factors are: weather data set, land utilisation factor, and wind turbine configuration. For our modelbased analysis, we define a reference scenario which is used to compare the results. Our analysis shows using a different weather data set increases the generation potential to roughly 35,000 TWh. This is 54% higher than the generation potential of the reference scenario. The land utilisation factor also has a large influence, ranging between -10% and -51%. The studies' assumptions and data should be subjected to careful scrutiny, as the calculated wind power potentials are widely used to develop decarbonisation strategies for the energy system.

J	Kusoglu, A				Kusoglu, Ahmet			The Many Colors of Hydrogen	ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY INTERFACE			English	Article								The last few years have given rise to an increased number of energy roadmaps and pledges by many countries committed to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), and to achieving net-zero emissions in accord with the Paris Agreement that aims to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C, compared to pre-industrial levels. The most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report(a) notes that global warming is likely to reach 1.5 degrees C between 2030 and 2052 if it continues at its current rate.(1) To limit and stabilize the long-term temperature increase, the recent International Energy Agency (IEA) and IPCC reports stress the need for achieving carbon-neutrality by 2050.(1-3) Achieving this transformation requires a series of policies and efforts involving various technological advances for decarbonizing many sectors, as outlined in many recent roadmaps providing a comprehensive analysis for decarbonization pathways.(2-28) A recurring theme in these roadmaps is the pivotal role of hydrogen and its potential to help steer the world toward achieving and realizing the decarbonization pathways (Fig. 1).

Canada's latest climate plan, entitled "A Healthy Environment and a Healthy Economy" aims to decarbonize various sectors of the economy including the electricity sector. In this paper, we explore the extent to which implementing announced policies and regulations could drive investment in the electricity sector needed to achieve Canada's climate objectives. To do so, we propose a multi-period, optimization-based capacity expansion model specifically designed for the Canadian context entitled COPPER for the "Canadian Opportunities for Planning and Production of Electricity Resources." We employ COPPER to analyze Canada's electricity system transition under various carbon management policies. Results show that current and announced policies significantly increase renewable energy capacity, which in turn decrease the electricity system emissions by 40 percent in the mid-term. However, in the long-term, more ambitious actions will be required to achieve the emissions reduction targets. Natural gas-powered generation facilities persist at the proposed carbon tax levels, and thus supplementary regulations or policies will be needed to achieve deep decarbonization.

Environmental benefits and household costs of clean heating options in northern China	NATURE SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article							AIR-QUALITY; POLLUTANT EMISSIONS; PM2.5 POLLUTION; HAZE EVENTS; ENERGY; COAL; TRANSITION; IMPACTS; CONSUMPTION; INVENTORY	Although the clean residential heating transition has been proceeding rapidly in China, the climate, air-quality and health impacts as well as the household costs of various heaters are not well known. This study analyses air-quality-health-carbon interdependencies and costs of alternative heating options at the provincial level across northern China. The Chinese government accelerated the clean residential heating transition in northern China as part of a successful effort to improve regional air quality. Meanwhile, China has committed to carbon neutrality by 2060, making strategic choices for long-term decarbonization of the residential sector necessary. However, the synergies and trade-offs for health and carbon of alternative heating options and associated costs have not been systematically considered. Here we investigate air-quality-health-carbon interdependencies as well as household costs of using electricity (heat pumps or resistance heaters), gas or clean coal for residential heating for individual provinces across northern China. We find substantial air-quality and health benefits, varied carbon emissions and increased heating costs across clean heating options. With the 2015 power mix, gas heaters offer the largest health-carbon co-benefits, while resistance heaters lead to health-carbon trade-offs. As the power grid decarbonizes, by 2030 heat pumps achieve the largest health-carbon synergies of the options we analysed. Despite high capital costs, heat pumps generally have the lowest operating costs and thus are competitive for long-term use. With increased subsidies on the purchase of heat pumps, the government can facilitate further air-quality improvements and carbon mitigation in the clean heating transition.

This will necessitate a step change in performance goals and tangible solutions. Regenerative urban development has emerged as a major pathway, together with decarbonisation, climate adaptation involving new blue-green infrastructures, and transition to a new green, circular economy. These grand challenges are all unlikely to be realised with current urban planning and governance systems within a time frame that can mitigate environmental, economic, and social disruption. A new national platform for urban innovation has been envisaged and implemented in Australia that is capable of enabling engagement of multiple stakeholders across government, industry, and community as well as real time synchronous collaboration, visioning, research synthesis, experimentation, and decision-making.

J	Cantarero, MMV				Cantarero, Maria Mercedes Vanegas			Reviewing the Nicaraguan transition to a renewable energy system: Why is "business-as-usual" no longer an option?	ENERGY POLICY			English	Review						Energy planning; EnergyPLAN; LEAP; Renewable energy; Smart energy system; Nicaragua	DEMAND-SIDE-MANAGEMENT; ELECTRICITY STORAGE; CURTAILMENT; GENERATION; EUROPE; MODELS; POWER; DSM	In 2012, there was a peak in investment in clean-energy technologies in Nicaragua. However, the renewable installed capacity used at that time represented only 12% of the theoretical potential. This prompted the Nicaraguan Government to develop an ambitious national action plan to expand the use of cleaner technologies for electricity generation. Using LEAP and EnergyPLAN, this study simulates the Nicaraguan energy system and provides a prognosis of the outcome of the national action plan by 2030. An additional scenario is created to assess the potential effects of a more intensive use of clean-energy technologies in the Nicaraguan energy system such as biofuels and efficiency measures in the residential sector. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the impact of interest rates and carbon prices on the electricity sector. The study found that focusing efforts solely on the electricity sector is likely to achieve modest changes to the primary energy mix, but no reduction in total GHG emissions by 2030. These findings suggest that decarbonization must take place in the whole energy system and that radical change in the fuels used for transport and cooking are necessary to enable a transition to a smart energy system.

J	Liu, XB; Jin, Z				Liu, Xianbing; Jin, Zhen			Visualisation approach and economic incentives toward low carbon practices in households: A survey study in Hyogo, Japan	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Visualisation approach; Economic incentive; Low-carbon practice; Household; Japan	ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; SAVING BEHAVIOR; DETERMINANTS; CONSERVATION; DEMAND; PARTICIPATION; INVESTMENTS	Considering the great significance of residential sector for deep decarbonisation in the medium and long term, this study analyses the effectiveness of an emissions visualisation approach and economic incentives in promoting household low-carbon practices. The data was gathered by a questionnaire survey from 406 households in Hyogo Prefecture, Japan, which received eco-home diagnosis in the past three years. The result confirms that around 40% of the samples installed home energy management system (HEMS) as the visualisation tool, and many households received low-carbon subsidies; however, few of them have utilised the low-interest loan from the government of Hyogo. Household lifestyle efforts are less associated with the policy measures and some differ due to family characteristics, i.e., the age of head of the household. Replacing household equipment with low-carbon items is largely determined by the visualisation approach and availability of economic incentives. As an example, the installation of HEMS would increase the probability of replacement with an electric heat pump water heater by 25.6% and the introduction of solar PV system by 55.9%. This study assists in understanding household low-carbon practices and their relationship with the related policy measures. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper assembles and evaluates technical and policy interventions, both on the supply side and on the demand side. It identifies measures that, employed together, can achieve net zero industrial emissions in the required timeframe. Key supply-side technologies include energy efficiency (especially at the system level), carbon capture, electrification, and zero-carbon hydrogen as a heat source and chemical feedstock. There are also promising technologies specific to each of the three top-emitting industries: cement, iron & steel, and chemicals & plastics. These include cement admixtures and alternative chemistries, several technological routes for zero-carbon steelmaking, and novel chemical catalysts and separation technologies. Crucial demand-side approaches include material-efficient design, reductions in material waste, substituting low-carbon for high-carbon materials, and circular economy interventions (such as improving product longevity, reusability, ease of refurbishment, and recyclability). Strategic, well-designed policy can accelerate innovation and provide incentives for technology deployment. High-value policies include carbon pricing with border adjustments or other price signals; robust government support for research, development, and deployment; and energy efficiency or emissions standards. These core policies should be supported by labeling and government procurement of low-carbon products, data collection and disclosure requirements, and recycling incentives. In implementing these policies, care must be taken to ensure a just transition for displaced workers and affected communities. Similarly, decarbonization must complement the human and economic development of low- and middle-income countries.

Decarbonization has become an inevitable trend in the electricity generation industry. Storage integrated renewable energy generation plants have enhanced the stability of the output of renewable energy to a certain degree. Wind power hydrogen production projects (WPHPPs) could be a promising solution to the Chinese government's peak carbon dioxide emissions goal. To achieve this goal, an evaluation system consisting of 12 main benefits factors is established. Then, an assessment approach based on Cloud-MULTIMOORA is proposed to select the best alternative. Specifically, HELTS-Cloud model is used to describe the information given by decision-makers and experts. Then, the SWARA and CRITIC methods are applied to obtain the subjective and objective weights. Additionally, a constrained optimization model is introduced to obtain the comprehensive weights. Finally, the MULTIMOORA-EDA method is used to obtain the final ranking of alternatives. Additionally, a case study is made to certify the usability and feasibility of the proposed method. This paper provides a method for assessing the benefits of WPHPP and promotes the application of this new kind of green energy project in the future.

J	Blyth, W; McCarthy, R; Gross, R				Blyth, William; McCarthy, Rory; Gross, Robert			Financing the UK power sector: Is the money available?	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Finance; Investment; Risk; Electricity; Utilities; Renewables	ENERGY-POLICY; INVESTMENT; RISK	The UK power generation sector faces a major new round of investment: the coincidence of asset retiring and ambitious goals for decarbonisation is not unique, but is particularly acute in the UK. The UK government has put in place a raft of new policies that seek to promote new, low carbon investment and ensure security of supply. The traditional channel for financing the sector has been through large utility companies, but this now looks challenging for various reasons. The UK therefore offers an interesting case study on several counts; the scale of the challenge, effectiveness of new policies, and the availability of alternative finance. We find that the link between the finance sector and the electricity sector is not 'broken', but the flow of money to the sector is threatened by the current weakness of the utilities' business model. This paper compares estimates of the scale of investment required in the UK with historical investment rates. It summarises contemporary finance industry views of conditions and trends, and potential policy interventions that might be needed to bridge the investment gap. The potential for channelling institutional investor funds directly into energy assets is reviewed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We use an integrated modelling framework, demonstrating the need for models with an appropriate level of technology detail for an accurate co-benefit assessment. The framework combines an integrated assessment model (GCAM) with an air quality model (TM5-FASST) to obtain estimates of premature mortality and then assesses their economic cost. The results show that significant co-benefits can be found for a range of technological options, such as introducing a limitation on bioenergy, carbon capture and storage (CCS) or nuclear power. Cumulative premature mortality may be reduced by 17-23% by 2020-2050 compared to the baseline, depending on the scenarios. However, the ratio of health co-benefits to mitigation costs varies substantially, ranging from 1.45 when a bioenergy limitation is set to 2.19 when all technologies are available. As for regional disaggregation, some regions, such as India and China, obtain far greater co-benefits than others.

J	Ramirez, J; Velazquez, DA; Velez-Zapata, C				Ramirez, Jacobo; Velazquez, Diego Angelino; Velez-Zapata, Claudia			The potential role of peace, justice, and strong institutions in Colombia?s areas of limited statehood for energy diversification towards governance in energy democracy	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Energy policy; Energy democracy; Non -conventional renewable energy; Colombia; Governance; Areas of limited statehood; SDG 16	RENEWABLE ENERGY; POWER; POLICY; LESSONS	We conducted a qualitative study (2019-22) to contextualise Colombia's energy policy for sustainable development and renewable energy diversification, focusing on the new governance toolbox of market incentives, weak institutions, security risks in areas of limited statehood, and the role of indigenous people. We also examined how geopolitical events, such as COVID-19 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, are affecting fossil fuel and decarbonisation strategies. Our findings suggest that weak institutions are a major obstacle to Colombia's energy transition. The Western definition of energy democracy takes for granted good governance in line with SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions; however, in Colombia, the context of social unrest, violence, corruption, and inequality hinders its implementation. Colombia's energy policy considers green investment a market opportunity rather than a way of institution building or phasing down fossil fuels, and there is no meaningful communication with civil society, especially indigenous people, to develop small-scale green investment initiatives. This study enhances energy policy by emphasising the role of governance and strong institutions in energy democracy. We argue that if governments and corporations were committed to climate change mitigation, they would invest in institution building over renewable energy.

Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) are seen as a promising technology, which could lead to the decarbonisation of the Light Duty Vehicle fleet and to independence from oil. However it still has to overcome some significant barriers to gain social acceptance and obtain appreciable market penetration. This review evaluates the technological readiness of the different elements of BEV technology and highlights those technological areas where important progress is expected. Techno-economic issues linked with the development of BEVs are investigated. Current BEVs in the market need to be more competitive than other low carbon vehicles, a requirement which stimulates the necessity for new business models. Finally, the all-important role of politics in this development is, also, discussed. As the benefit of BEVs can help countries meet their environmental targets, governments have included them in their roadmaps and have developed incentives to help them penetrate the market.

The article looks at the diversity of claims presented to ascribe meaning to policy problems (i.e. structural conditions, contextual technical or ideational appeals to values), and framed within wider institutional perspectives for reform, development, and strategies for addressing climate change in Mexico and Vietnam. The findings suggest both governments maintain a more exclusive than inclusive form of energy governance and retain centralized power over renewable energy and climate change mitigation responses. This is not only because of technological infrastructural lock-ins, but also because they maintain a more exclusive than inclusive form of energy governance that is justified and legitimized by the need for energy supply and access security, and green growth as a source of continuous economic growth. Framing broader energy reforms as part of climate change mitigation goals allow for incumbent actors to further legitimise a conservative neoliberal agenda. These two cases offer insights into how newly emerging economies are facing energy sector reforms while being confronted with energy sector transformations dictated by the climate change mitigation agenda.

J	Tozer, L; Klenk, N				Tozer, Laura; Klenk, Nicole			Discourses of carbon neutrality and imaginaries of urban futures	ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Carbon governance; Urban; Sociotechnical imaginaries; Discourse analysis	SOCIOTECHNICAL IMAGINARIES; CLIMATE; ENERGY; CITIES; POLITICS; EUROPE	By analyzing the discourses in carbon governance texts, this paper identifies visions for the built environment in carbon neutral urban futures and the storylines driving those urban imaginaries. Local authorities have begun aiming for 'carbon neutral' transformations, but it is not clear what kind of city will result. Different imaginaries about the futurity of energy will send cities down divergent sociotechnical paths. Using discourse analysis, this paper identifies the storylines underlying sociotechnical imaginaries of urban carbon neutrality among the 17 founding members of the Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance, which is a network of local governments mainly from Europe and North America pioneering deep decarbonization. This paper elaborates on five storylines in urban carbon governance texts: 1. The diverse meanings of carbon neutrality 2. The new economy of carbon control 3. The city as a laboratory 4. Technological fixes and the modern city and 5. Reframing what it means to be a 'good' urban citizen. The developing sociotechnical imaginary of urban carbon neutrality is structuring shifts in policy and practice. Trends include a focus on technological fixes and innovation as solutions where private capital is a fundamental partner, as well as reflexivity about the experimental nature of achieving carbon neutrality.

ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Climate change mitigation; Energy system modelling; Scottish energy policy	GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM; ENERGY; MARKAL; SECTOR; MODEL; REDUCTION; SCENARIOS; ECONOMY	The UK government has established ambitious policies to address climate change and promote renewable energy, and has set targets both for reducing carbon emissions and for deploying renewables. Scotland, a constituent nation of the UK, has also set its own targets for climate change mitigation and renewable electricity. This paper analyses the energy, economic and environmental implications of carbon and renewable electricity targets in Scotland and the UK using a newly developed two-region UK MARKAL energy system model, where Scotland (SCT) and rest of the UK (RUK) are the two regions. The paper shows that meeting Scotland's carbon targets does not require additional decarbonisation effort if the UK meets its own targets at least cost: and that Scotland's renewable energy ambitions do imply additional costs above the least cost path to the meeting the UK's obligations under the EU renewable energy directive. Meeting Scottish renewable electricity targets diverts investment and deployment in renewables from rest of the UK to Scotland. In addition to increased energy system cost, Scottish renewable electricity targets may also require early investment in new electricity transmission capacity between Scotland and rest of the UK.

Blockchain creates an immutable chain of transaction blocks without the intervention of a trusted third party that enables secured trustless environments. Distributed ledger technology such as blockchain has drawn significant interest from government agencies, financial institutions, start-ups, technology enthusiastic, financial institutions, and the academic and research community. This technology can support a wide range of applications from identity management to IoT applications. The energy industry has been consistently catalyzed by innovations like decarbonization, decentralization, and digitization. With numerous organizations developing low-cost renewable energy revolution like solar powers, wind energy, and Energy as a service, our proposed solution would ease the demand for energy supply in rural areas by combining blockchain and IoT. To address the growing demand of the rural electrifying process we propose a Distributed Application (DApp) that can securely record the ownership and consumption of energy generated through solar panels connected through an IoT device. This DApp empowers rural energy supply trading without grids and has the potential to improve the incentives to utility providers by offering carbon credits or renewable energy certificates thus attracting investors.

J	Galvin, R				Galvin, Ray			Identifying possible drivers of rebound effects and reverse rebounds among households with rooftop photovoltaics	RENEWABLE ENERGY FOCUS			English	Article							ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY; SOLAR PV; BARRIERS; SYSTEMS; OPPORTUNITIES; BUILDINGS; POWER	Rebound effects after energy efficiency increases are problematic because they confound policymakers' calculations of reductions in energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Recently rebound effect research has been extended to consider rebounds in electricity and other energy consumption, triggered by adoption of rooftop photovoltaics among households (called "prosumers''). This research is increasingly important as governments aim for deep decarbonization via green hydrogen produced by ramping up renewable electricity production. To date this research has estimated net rebound effects in terms of extra electricity consumed, usually focusing on income and price effects. This study takes the issue further, exploring a fuller range of rebound and reverse rebound phenomena that can occur among prosumer households. Using qualitative data from interviews with prosumer households in detached and semi-detached houses in Germany, the study proposes a four-elements conceptual framework for interpreting their many-faceted, apparent rebound-related behaviour. This includes monetary and other attitudinal effects; sociotechnical effects; influences of nature; and regulatory effects. The findings can inform larger, country-wide research to quantify and estimate the extent of these rebound and reverse rebound drivers. They can also guide policymakers in forming preliminary ideas for interventions to optimise household use of photovoltaics.

The development of the Renewables Obligation in England and Wales 2002-2010	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Renewables Obligation; Risk; Renewable policy	ENERGY-POLICY; UK	The UK has enviable renewable resources, both onshore (wind) and offshore (wind, wave and tidal) (The Offshore Valuation Group, 2010). The government has had policy mechanisms in place since 1990 to encourage these resources to be developed. The current mechanism, the Renewables Obligation (RO), was specifically designed to emphasise competition and therefore to fit in with the UK's overall strategic approach to energy policy. However, as yet, it has not delivered the capacity that it was designed to do, and as a result the UK faces a difficult challenge in attempting to meet European-wide renewable energy targets for 2020, as well as longer term decarbonisation targets. This paper explores some of the major reasons why the RO has performed so poorly to date and considers the prospects for improvement up to 2020. It concludes that the strategic emphasis on competition in the support mechanisms has played a key role in limiting renewables development, but that the mechanism has changed significantly since it was introduced. However, these changes, together with proposals for electricity market reform, still do not address important elements of risk in comparison with a standard Feed In Tariff. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Geothermal energy as a means to decarbonize the energy mix of megacities	COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							ELECTRICITY; FIELD	Geothermal energy can provide enough power to serve the current and future needs of megacities such as Bogota, Los Angeles and Jakarta and also provide flexibility and baseload capacity, according to an assessment of the geothermal resource base in each city. The global number of megacities is projected to increase from 33 to 43 by 2030. Megacities are critical for the world's economy; however, their resource management is particularly challenging. The increase of energy demand, in parallel to population growth and climate change, requires urgent investment in sustainable energies. We examine the megacities of Bogota, Los Angeles, and Jakarta and reveal that the potential geothermal resource base is enough to cover the residential electricity demand by 1.14, 4.25, 1.84 times, respectively. Geothermal energy, a clean baseload resource independent from weather conditions, could significantly contribute to energy needs, improved air quality, and the decarbonization of the world's megacities. We conclude that it is critical that governments and public are educated about the benefits of geothermal. Moreover, those energy policies coupled with investment in research and development are needed to ensure geothermal is successfully integrated into the future energy mix.

It provides a look forward to Phase II of the CCP and future research needs. Separation technology challenges include: A fundamentally different approach to post-combustion capture. The CCP saw some potential for novel integrated approaches for separation with advanced solvents. Pre-combustion decarbonization to make hydrogen at very large scale as a precursor to a hydrogen-based combustion system. A systems analysis and comprehensive approach to the major components of a hydrogen fuel system are needed. Oxygen-fired combustion. Combustion in either oxygen-enriched air or pure oxygen offers the advantage of reduced NOx and SOx emissions while producing a highly concentrated CO2 stream for sequestration. Oxygen production is a major need and challenge - at the needed scale and costs. Chemical looping combustion that combines oxygen production with combustion may have great promise. It needs comprehensive study to determine its future potential. Public policy, incentives and regulatory activities by the various governments will be a substantial challenge for those attempting to sequester CO2. Worldwide governmental actions must be monitored and accounted for in future technical developments.

Risk assessment of wind droughts over India	CURRENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Decarbonization; grid interconnections; risk assessment; stochastic weather generators; wind drought	WEATHER	Wind power growth makes it essential to simulate weather variability and its impacts on the electricity grid. Low-probability, high-impact weather events such as a wind drought are important but difficult to identify based on limited historical datasets. A stochastic weather generator, Imperial College Weather Generator (IMAGE), is employed to identify extreme events through long-period simulations. IMAGE captures mean, spatial correlation and seasonality in wind speed and estimates return periods of extreme wind events over India. Simulations show that when Rajasthan experiences wind drought, southern India continues to have wind, and vice versa. Regional grid-scale wind droughts could be avoided if grids are strongly interconnected across the country.	[Gangopadhyay, A.; Seshadri, A.

However, there is significant variation in projected bioenergy deployment results, as well as concerns about the potential environmental and social implications of supplying biomass. Bioenergy deployment projections are market equilibrium solutions from integrated modeling, yet little is known about the underlying modeling of the supply of biomass as a feedstock for energy use in these modeling frameworks. We undertake a novel diagnostic analysis with ten global models to elucidate, compare, and assess how biomass is supplied within the models used to inform long-run climate management. With experiments that isolate and reveal biomass supply modeling behavior and characteristics (costs, emissions, land use, market effects), we learn about biomass supply tendencies and differences. The insights provide a new level of modeling transparency and understanding of estimated global biomass supplies that informs evaluation of the potential for bioenergy in managing the climate and interpretation of integrated modeling. For each model, we characterize the potential distributions of global biomass supply across regions and feedstock types for increasing levels of quantity supplied, as well as some of the potential societal externalities of supplying biomass. We also evaluate the biomass supply implications of managing these externalities. Finally, we interpret biomass market results from integrated modeling in terms of our new understanding of biomass supply. Overall, we find little consensus between models on where biomass could be cost-effectively produced and the implications. We also reveal model specific biomass supply narratives, with results providing new insights into integrated modeling bioenergy outcomes and differences. The analysis finds that many integrated models are considering and managing emissions and land use externalities of supplying biomass and estimating that environmental and societal trade-offs in the form of land emissions, land conversion, and higher agricultural prices are cost-effective, and to some degree a reality of using biomass, to address climate change.

J	Yang, XL; Heidug, W; Cooke, D				Yang, Xiaoliang; Heidug, Wolfgang; Cooke, Douglas			An adaptive policy-based framework for China's Carbon Capture and Storage development	FRONTIERS OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						CCS; policy; climate change; China		China's political leadership has taken an increasingly public and proactive stance on climate change since 2014. This stance includes making a commitment that Chinese carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions will peak around 2030 and enacting measures through the 13th Five Year Plan to support energy efficiency, clean energy technology, and carbon management. Chinese policy-makers consider carbon capture and storage (CCS) a critical bridging technology to help accelerate the decarbonization of its economy. This paper reviews and analyzes Chinese CCS support policies from the perspective of an adaptive policymaking framework, recognizing uncertainty as an inherent element of the policymaking process and drawing general lessons for responding to changing circumstances. Notably, the political support for CCS in China remains fragmented with uncoordinated government leadership, undecided industry players, and even with opposing voices from some leading scientists. There is scope for expanding the framework to provide more granularity, in particular relating to the development of a CCS infrastructure and the development of storage focused CO2-EOR. Overall, given the role CCS can play to decarbonize China's power and other industrial sectors, a commitment to CCS from top policymakers and major stakeholders is needed.

Emergency deployment of direct air capture as a response to the climate crisis	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							EMISSIONS; MITIGATION; WELL	Though highly motivated to slow the climate crisis, governments may struggle to impose costly polices on entrenched interest groups, resulting in a greater need for negative emissions. Here, we model wartime-like crash deployment of direct air capture (DAC) as a policy response to the climate crisis, calculating funding, net CO2 removal, and climate impacts. An emergency DAC program, with investment of 1.2-1.9% of global GDP annually, removes 2.2-2.3 GtCO(2) yr(-1) in 2050, 13-20 GtCO(2) yr(-1) in 2075, and 570-840 GtCO(2) cumulatively over 2025-2100. Compared to a future in which policy efforts to control emissions follow current trends (SSP2-4.5), DAC substantially hastens the onset of net-zero CO2 emissions (to 2085-2095) and peak warming (to 2090-2095); yet warming still reaches 2.4-2.5 degrees C in 2100. Such massive CO2 removals hinge on near-term investment to boost the future capacity for upscaling. DAC is most cost-effective when using electricity sources already available today: hydropower and natural gas with renewables; fully renewable systems are more expensive because their low load factors do not allow efficient amortization of capital-intensive DAC plants. Governments may struggle to impose costly polices on vital industries, resulting in a greater need for negative emissions. Here, the authors model a direct air capture crash deployment program, finding it can remove 2.3 GtCO(2) yr(-1) in 2050, 13-20 GtCO(2) yr(-1) in 2075, and 570-840 GtCO(2) cumulative over 2025-2100.

Total Social Costs and Benefits of Long-Distance Hydropower Transmission	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						renewable energy; hydropower; decarbonization; environmental impact assessment; cost-benefit analysis	IMPACTS	Increasing amounts of hydropower are being exported from Canada to the northern United States. Recently proposed projects would increase transmission capacity to U.S. population centers without increasing generation. This avoids generation-side impacts from hydroelectric development and introduces power to the U.S. energy mix that is dispatchable, unlike wind and solar, with greenhouse gas emissions generally lower than those of fossil fuels. There is, however, a lack of analysis comparing high upfront capital costs to social benefits and controversy over valuation of social costs of hydropower from existing generation given the negligible marginal cost of production. This analysis evaluates direct and indirect costs in comparison to alternatives for a 1250 MW transmission line from Canada to New York City currently under development to replace the recent loss of similar to 15 TWh year-1 of nuclear generation. For the case study considered, we find that long-distance transmission avoids $13.2 billion ($12.1-14.4 billion) in total social costs by 2050. This includes $4.2 billion ($3.4-5.1 billion) from premature mortality in disproportionately Hispanic and African American or Black counties (roughly 306 avoided deaths). In an extensive sensitivity analysis, results are robust to all modeling choices other than the cost assigned to hydropower: the nominal dollar value of hydropower imports (payments from buyer to seller) commonly used in cost-benefit analysis leads to substantial underestimates of net benefits from transmission projects. The opportunity cost of these imports (e.g., environmental benefits foregone in alternative export markets) is a better metric for cost but is difficult to estimate.	[Calder, Ryan S.

J	Newell, P; Bulkeley, H				Newell, Peter; Bulkeley, Harriet			Landscape for change? International climate policy and energy transitions: evidence from sub-Saharan Africa	CLIMATE POLICY			English	Article						Africa; carbon finance; climate change mitigation; climate policy frameworks; energy policy	TECHNOLOGICAL TRANSITIONS; POLITICAL-ECONOMY; PERSPECTIVE	What is the role of the climate regime in facilitating rapid decarbonization of the world's energy systems? We examine how core assumptions concerning the roles of the nation state, carbon markets and finance and technology in international climate policy are being challenged by the realities of how transitions in the energy systems are unfolding. Drawing on the critical region of sub-Saharan Africa, we examine the potential for international climate policy to foster new trajectories towards decarbonization.Policy relevanceThe international regime for climate policy has been in place for some twenty years. Despite significant changes in the landscape of energy systems and drivers of global GHG emissions over this time, the core principles and tools remain relatively stable - national governments, carbon markets, project-based climate finance and the transfer of technological hardware. Given the diversity of actors and drivers and the limited direct reach and influence of international climate policy, however, there is an urgent need to consider how the climate regime can best support the embryonic transitions that are slowly taking form around the world. To do this effectively requires a more nuanced understanding of the role of the state in governing these transitions beyond the notion of a cohesive state serving as rule-enforcer and transition manager. It also requires a broader view of technology, not just as hardware that is transferred, but as a set of practices and networks of expertise and enabling actors. Likewise, though markets have an important role to play as vehicles for achieving broader ends, they are not an end in themselves. Finally on finance, while acknowledging the important role of climate aid, often as a multiplier or facilitator of more ambitious private flows, it is critical to differentiate between the types of finance required for different transitions, many of which will not be counted under, or directed by, the climate regime. In sum, the (low-) carbon economy is being built in ways and in numerous sites that the climate regime needs to be cognizant of and engage with productively, and this may require fundamental reconsideration of the building blocks of the international climate regime.

Responsibility for achieving this does not only lie with policy makers but is shared with all stakeholders including governments, private sectors, charities and civil society as a whole. Several methodological approaches have been developed to set emission reduction targets, including the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi). However, it is yet to be widely adopted, and as thought leaders in the field, universities must take a lead in its interpretation and application. This study is reported from the perspective of a UK university, which is adopting climate change considerations to facilitate achieving Czero by 2030 and will act as an exemplar case. We calculate baseline emissions, science-based reduction targets for different carbon emission reduction methods and options in terms of financing emission reduction pathways at present and in the future. The study outcomes show that incorporating a SBTi methodology can serve as insight into other medium-sized organisations and universities wishing to develop a net-zero pathway. These results have been summarised into a series of recommendations.

Study of the deactivation mechanism of carbon blacks used in methane decomposition	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY			English	Article						hydrogen production; methane decarbonization; carbon catalysts; catalyst deactivation	HYDROGEN-PRODUCTION; CATALYTIC DECOMPOSITION; FLUIDIZED-BED; NATURAL-GAS; THERMOCATALYTIC DECOMPOSITION; THERMAL-DECOMPOSITION; ACTIVATED CARBONS; HYDROCARBON	Carbon blacks have recently gained attention as suitable catalysts for the CO.-free hydrogen production by thermo-catalytic decomposition of methane (TCD) because of their stability and efficiency. In the present work, several commercial carbon blacks were studied as catalysts for the TCD of methane by varying the temperature and the methane space velocity. The BP2000 carbon black sample, which showed the highest activity in methane decomposition per mass of catalyst, was studied more thoroughly. Despite BP2000 exhibiting stable activity in the TCD of methane during several hours on stream, a long duration run carried out at 950 degrees C revealed that it finally became deactivated. The changes in the physicochemical properties (textural properties, surface chemistry and crystallinity) of the BP2000 sample at different stages of the catalyst lifetime were measured, and the main results obtained are presented here. The paper also discusses the potential of the production of a wide range of hydrogen-methane mixtures, which can be directly fed to an internal combustion engine, by means of TCD with carbonaceous catalysts.

This study explores the individual's behavioral intention to reduce the air pollution associated with vehicles, household appliances, and religious practices. An extended theory of planned behavior (TPB), past behavior included, serves as the analytical model, while the approach of partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) is employed in the model's estimation. The results show that subjective norms represent the primary driver of individual intentions to reduce air pollution, followed by perceived behavioral control, past behavior, and attitude, in that order. Surprisingly, advocacy on the part of the government to reduce the burning of incense and joss paper, disregarding years of social conflicts and protests, plays the most important role among all indicators within the construct subjective norms. This result holds even within the subsample of believers in religions that involve the practice of burning incense and joss paper. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Techno-economic and spatial optimization of renewables-hydrogen strategies in Spain	JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE			English	Article						Renewable hydrogen-based systems; Low-carbon electricity supply; Spanish building stock; Centralized vs distributed; Techno-economic optimization; Land eligibility	FUEL-CELL; SEASONAL STORAGE; ENERGY-SYSTEMS; OPTIMAL-DESIGN; SUPPLY CHAIN; POWER; WIND; FUTURE; GAS; SURPLUS	Europe has set ambitious targets to reduce the final energy consumption of buildings in concerning the degree of electrification, energy efficiency, and penetration of renewable energy sources (RES). So far, hydrogen is becoming an increasingly important energy vector, offering huge opportunities to promote the share of inter-mittent RES. Thus, this manuscript proposes an energy model for the complete decarbonization of the estimated electricity consumed by the Spanish building stock in 2030 and 2050 scenarios; the model is based on the combination of photovoltaic and wind primary sources and hydrogen technologies considering both distributed and centralized configurations, applying also geospatial criteria for their optimal allocation. Large-scale RES generation, centralized hydrogen production, and re-electrification, along with underground hydrogen storage, result in the lowest levelized cost of energy (LCOE), hydrogen production costs (HPC), and the highest overall efficiency (mu SYS). Wind energy is mainly harvested in the north of Spain, while large PV farms are deployed in the mid-south. Furthermore, reinforcement of underground hydrogen storage enhances the overall system perfor-mance, reducing surplus energy and the required RES generation capacity. Finally, all the considered scenarios achieve LCOE below the Spanish utility grid benchmark, apart from accomplishing the decarbonization goals established for the year 2030.	[Maestre, V.

J	Isley, SC; Lempert, RJ; Popper, SW; Vardavas, R				Isley, Steven C.; Lempert, Robert J.; Popper, Steven W.; Vardavas, Raffaele			The effect of near-term policy choices on long-term greenhouse gas transformation pathways	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS			English	Article						Policy persistence; Transformation pathways; Agent based modeling; Coalition formation; Sustainability transitions; Climate change	SUSTAINABILITY; INSTRUMENTS; PROTOCOL; ROBUST	To successfully limit climate change, today's greenhouse gas mitigation policies should encourage reductions that will continue for decades. History suggests, however, that some policy reforms lead to societal changes that persist over the long-term while others fade without long-term effect. Current climate policy literature provides little guidance on how today's policy choices can successfully shape long-term emission reduction paths. To address such questions, this paper introduces a new agent-based, game theoretic model designed to compare how near-term choices regarding alternative policy architectures influence long-term emission reduction trajectories. Drawing on political science literature that identifies the characteristics of policies that persist over time, this simulation for the first time integrates the co-evolution of an industry sector, its technology base, and the shifting political coalitions that influence the future stringency of the government's emission reduction policies all as influenced by the initial choice of policy architecture. An exploratory modeling analysis that represents deeply uncertain phenomena such as the future potential for innovation and the behavior of future governments draws policy-relevant conclusions from this model. The analysis finds that near-term choices regarding the architecture of a carbon pricing policy may affect long-term decarbonization rates significantly. In particular, such rates are higher if program revenues are returned to firms in proportion to their market share, thus, creating a political constituency for continuing the carbon pricing policy. More generally, the analysis provides a framework for considering how near-term policy choices can affect long-term emission transformation pathways within integrated assessment models.

Two configurations, targeting two different outlet CO2 specifications ('moderate' 95% purity and 'high' 99.9% purity) are designed, modelled and optimized in order to minimize the incremental clinker production cost for different values of the carbon tax. Mass and energy balances are simulated with Aspen Plus, while the operating conditions are numerically optimized with Matlab. Results show that moderate purity can be achieved with an increased cost of clinker of 16.3 euro/tclk (CO2 recovery 99.3%), while the base high purity configuration leads to a 19.3 euro/tclk increase (CO2 recovery 96.1%). Sensitivity analyses are carried out on design parameters (fuel and air infiltrations in the oxyfuel calciner line) and exogenous factors (carbon tax, CO2 intensity of electricity). Air infiltration rate has the highest impact on the incremental cost of clinker (increased by 25% when air leakage grows from 0 to 10%) and on the selection of optimal operational conditions. Off-design analyses aimed at assessing the impact of air infiltration changing over time highlight the relevance of designing the CPU for the scenario with air infiltrations, while selecting reasonable temperature differences (e.g. 5K) to avoid operability issues in the cold box heat exchanger. For the base case CPU, the cost of clinker increases by 3 euro/tclk when moving from zero to 10% air infiltration.

J	Carley, S				Carley, Sanya			Energy demand-side management: New perspectives for a new era	JOURNAL OF POLICY ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							EFFICIENCY; SELECTION; STATES	Over the past decade and a half, state governments have assumed greater responsibility over demand-side management (DSM) operations. Whereas DSM programs formerly were initiated primarily by utilities or state public utility commissions, they are now becoming increasingly state-initiated and incentivized through funding mechanisms or efficiency-level mandates. The supporting literature, however, has yet to respond to these changes and to verify that DSM funding or mandates are effective policy mechanisms. Furthermore, the supporting literature has yet to resolve some of the research design and methodological challenges that traditionally plague DSM evaluations. As states continue to expand their energy and climate policy efforts, and the federal government considers the possibility of national decarbonization policies, of which DSM is a key strategy, the need for empirical research on the effectiveness of DSM programs will grow. This essay describes the current status of DSM efforts in the U.S. and explores how these programs affect electricity operations. The relationship between DSM policy and program efforts and the amount of saved electricity is tested with a methodological approach aimed at minimizing the selection bias that is inherent in the nonexperimental research design. Results confirm that state-run DSM efforts contribute to electricity savings across the country. Public benefit funds coupled with performance incentives are found to encourage utility participation in DSM programs. Energy efficiency portfolio standards and performance incentives effectively promote electricity savings, but public benefit funds without the support of other DSM policies are not significant drivers of either DSM program participation or total DSM electricity savings.

The effects of fuel variability on the electrical performance and durability of a solid oxide fuel cell operating on biohythane	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY			English	Article						Biohydrogen; Carbon deposition; Fuel processing; SOFC stability; Natural gas; Grid decarbonisation	2-STAGE ANAEROBIC-DIGESTION; NATURAL-GAS; CARBON DEPOSITION; COMBINED HEAT; EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION; HYDROGEN-PRODUCTION; ENERGY-PRODUCTION; BIOGAS; METHANE; SOFC	Biohythane is typically composed of 60/30/10 vol% CH4/CO2/H-2 and can be produced via two-stage anaerobic digestion of renewable and low carbon biomass with much greater efficiency compared with CH4/CO2 biogas. This work investigates the effects of fuel variability on the electrical performance and fuel processing of a commercially available anode supported solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) operating on biohythane mixtures at 750 degrees C. Cell electrical performance was characterised using current-voltage curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Fuel processing was characterised using quadrupole mass spectroscopy. It is shown that when H-2/CO2 is blended with CH4 to make biohythane, the SOFC efficiency is significantly increased, high SOFC durability is achieved, and there are considerable savings in CH4 consumption. Enhanced electrical performance was due to the additional presence of H-2 and promotion of CH4 dry reforming, the reverse Boudouard and reverse water-gas shift reactions. These processes alleviated carbon deposition and promoted electrochemical oxidation of H-2 as the primary power production pathway. Substituting 50 vol% CH4 with 25/75 vol% H-2/CO2 was shown to increase cell power output by 81.6% at 0.8 V compared with pure CH4. This corresponded to a 3.4-fold increase in the overall energy conversion efficiency and a 72% decrease in CH4 consumption. A 260 h durability test demonstrated very high cell durability when operating on a typical 60/30/10 vol% CH4/CO2/H-2 biohythane mixture under high fuel utilisation due to inhibition of carbon deposition. Overall, this work suggests that decarbonising gas grids by substituting natural gas with renewably produced H-2/CO2 mixtures (rather than pure H-2 derived from fossil fuels), and utilising in SOFC technology, gives considerable gains in energy conversion efficiency and carbon emissions savings.

J	Safaei, H; Keith, DW				Safaei, Hossein; Keith, David W.			How much bulk energy storage is needed to decarbonize electricity?	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article								High cost and technical immaturity of bulk (multi-hour) electricity storage (BES) systems are often cited as major hurdles to increasing the penetration of intermittent renewables. We use a simple model to assess the economics of BES under carbon emissions constraints. Size and dispatch of a green-field generation fleet is optimized to meet a variable load at a 15 minute time resolution. Electricity supply options are wind, gas turbine, BES, and a generic dispatchable-zero-carbon (DZC) source as a proxy for fossil fuel plants with carbon capture or nuclear plants. We review the cost of selected BES technologies and parameterize the performance of storage, focusing on the energy-and power-specific capital costs. We examine sensitivity of the electricity cost to storage performance under a range of emissions constraints. Availability of inexpensive BES systems in general and particularly electrochemical technologies has a small impact on the overall cost of decarbonization. Proportional reductions in capital costs of wind and DZC lower decarbonization costs far more. We find no economic justification for seasonal storage. Intermittent renewables can be used to decarbonize the electricity supply with a proportionally small requirement for BES because gas provides much of the intermittency management even when the carbon emissions intensity is cut to less than 30% of today's U.S. average. Substantial BES is required only when emissions are constrained to nearly zero and DZC is not allowed.

J	Brook, BW; Edney, K; Hillerbrand, R; Karlsson, R; Symons, J				Brook, Barry W.; Edney, Kingsley; Hillerbrand, Rafaela; Karlsson, Rasmus; Symons, Jonathan			Energy research within the UNFCCC: a proposal to guard against ongoing climate-deadlock	CLIMATE POLICY			English	Article						induced technological change; innovation policy; multilateral climate policy frameworks; research policy	TECHNOLOGICAL-CHANGE; NEGOTIATIONS	We propose that an international Low-Emissions Technology Commitment' should be incorporated into the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiation process in order to promote innovation that will enable deep decarbonization. The goal is to accelerate research, development, and demonstration of safe, scalable, and affordable low-emissions energy technologies. Such a commitment should be based on three elements. First, it should operate within existing UNFCCC negotiations so as to encourage developed states to offer directed funding for energy research as part of their national contributions. Second, pledges should be binding, verifiable, and coordinated within an international energy-research plan. Third, expert scientific networks and participating governments should collaborate to design a coordinated global research and technology-demonstration strategy and oversee national research efforts. To this end an Intergovernmental Panel on Low-Emissions Technology Research might be established. This proposal offers some insurance against the risk that the political impasse in international negotiations cannot be overcome. The higher costs associated with low-emissions alternatives to fossil fuels currently creates significant economic and political resistance to their widespread adoption. To breach this impasse, a mechanism supporting accelerated energy research is needed that seeks to reduce future abatement costs, share experience and learning-by-doing' in first-of-a-kind demonstrations, and thus facilitate future widespread deployments. These actions will also assist in addressing inequalities in energy access.Policy relevanceOver the past decade, global fossil-fuel use and associated carbon emissions have risen steadily, despite the majority of nations agreeing, in principle, to work to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees C above pre-industrial conditions (IPCC, 2014). Accelerated research, development, and demonstration of low-emissions technologies will be required for successful and economically efficient decarbonization of the global economy, but how can the current deadlock be broken? The UNFCCC does not contain adequate mechanisms to promote increased investment in research, so climate-governance institutions are not capturing the gains that could be achieved through a globally coordinated approach. Here, we outline reform proposals that would enhance both the economic effectiveness of global abatement efforts and the political feasibility of accelerated innovation.

J	Ruoso, AC; Ribeiro, JLD				Ruoso, Ana Cristina; Ribeiro, Jose Luis Duarte			An assessment of barriers and solutions for the deployment of electric vehicles in the Brazilian market	TRANSPORT POLICY			English	Article						Electric vehicles; Innovation diffusion; Sociotechnical system; Sustainability	TO-GRID V2G; ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; ADOPTION; PERCEPTIONS; EMISSIONS; RETHINKING; INTENTIONS; MULTILEVEL; PURCHASE; IMPACTS	The growing concerns about the energy and environmental crisis drive the development of a sustainable society. The electric vehicle (EV) is a potentially clean technology that can contribute to the decarbonization of the transportation sector. However, EVs face obstacles to being diffused and are not prevalent in the global vehicle fleet. Thus, this research identifies the attractiveness, barriers, and solutions for the diffusion of EVs. Semi -structured interviews were conducted with key agents of the Brazilian supply chain of this technology. Results showed that EVs have essential attractions, but there are barriers to their diffusion in the Brazilian market related to EV cost, charging infrastructure, and public policies. The main solutions to overcome these barriers and expand EV adoption involve: (i) increase of emission consumer awareness through promotional campaigns by government and industry, (ii) tax and non-tax incentives, e.g., reduction of taxation on EV purchase or parts of it, reduction of annual fees or special transit permits for EV, and (iii) technological advances, notably in terms of battery performance and availability and efficiency of charging stations. This research comprises aspects of EV diffusion in Brazil but can serve as guidance for other countries with emerging economies or regions where EV adoption is still incipient.

An existing residential building in Nanjing was chosen as a case study. The paper investigated the environmental, energy, and economic efficiency of the case building hypothetically refurbished to the Passive House (PH) and "low energy building" (LEB) technologies. The analysis was made based on real construction and energy consumption data, monitored over three years. Also, a comparison of the environmental, energy-efficient, and economic feasibility of two hypothetical models refurbished to the PH and LEB technologies is considered. The results show that BIM-enabled LCA is a powerful tool for refurbishing existing residential buildings due to a comprehensive assessment of environmental compatibility, energy efficiency, and profitability. According to the results, special attention should be paid to reducing cooling loads, using materials with a high recycling rate and low cost, reducing the thickness of the insulation layer, using polyvinyl chloride (PVC) windows with movable sunshades, and setting horizontal and vertical greenery systems.

In this study, we introduced thermal power, clean energy, and traditional fossil energy as three different input factors into the translog production function. We considered three improvement paths of the energy structure, including replacing fossil energy with electricity and using thermal power to substitute for clean energy and then analyzed whether the directed technological change promotes the optimization of the energy structure in China. The results show that there is a substitution relationship between thermal power and clean energy during the internal transition process, and the biased technical change is thermal power-using, which suggests that technological change is not conducive to the improvement of electricity structure from thermal power to clean energy. In external transition, the biased technical change is fossil energy-using instead of thermal power-using or clean power-using, and there is a substitution relationship among three factors, which shows that technical change goes against the improvement of energy structure from fossil energy to electricity. We propose that the Chinese governments adopt energy price or carbon tax measures to adjust the directed technical change and thus optimize the energy structure. In addition, according to the results from China, different countries can improve the energy structure based on their characteristic production mode.

J	Jennings, N; Fecht, D; De Matteis, S				Jennings, Neil; Fecht, Daniela; De Matteis, Sara			Mapping the co-benefits of climate change action to issues of public concern in the UK: a narrative review	LANCET PLANETARY HEALTH			English	Review							AIR-QUALITY; ENERGY EFFICIENCY; GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE; CHANGE MITIGATION; NORTH-EAST; HEALTH; POLLUTION; IMPACTS; EMISSIONS; ENGLAND	To avoid a 1.5 degrees C rise in global temperatures above preindustrial levels, the next phase of reductions in greenhouse gas emissions will need to be comparatively rapid. Linking the co-benefits of climate action to wider issues that the public are concerned about can help decision makers to prioritise decarbonisation options that increase the chance of public support for such changes, while ensuring that a just transition is delivered. We identified key issues of concern to the UK public by use of Ipsos MORI public opinion data from 2007 to 2020 and used these data to guide a narrative review of academic and grey literature on the co-benefits of climate change action for the UK. Correspondence with civil servants, third sector organisations, and relevant academics allowed us to identify omissions and to ensure policy relevance of the recommendations. This evidence-based Review of the various co-benefits of climate change action for the UK identifies four main areas: health and the National Health Service; security; economy and unemployment; and poverty, housing, and inequality. Associated trade-offs are also discussed. City-level and regional-level governments are particularly well placed to incorporate co-benefits into their decision making because it is at this scale that co-benefits most clearly manifest, and where interventions can have the most immediate effects.

In this article, diesel-powered collections vehicle (dWCV) and electric waste collections vehicle (eWCV) and their operation are analyzed regarding energy demand and total cost of ownership (TCO) integrating well-to-wheel emission casts. Furthermore, an open-source simulation tool with a route synthetization approach is presented using extensive real-life operational data of five different route types. Determined WCV energy demand varies greatly between vehicle topologies and analyzed route types. eWCV shows a mean distance-specific energy demand of 1.85 kWh-km(-1), while values for dWCV increase to 5.43 kWh-km(-1), respectively. The factors route distance and the number of waste containers collected show the highest influence on results. Therefore, battery capacity should be sized according to specific route types. eWCV shows higher TCO than dWCV under current economic constraints, but fuel price level and annual vehicle mileage show a high influence on economic feasibility. Taking the planned emissions price mechanism of the German Government into account, economic scenarios could be identified, which make eWCV advantageous yet in 2021. In technical terms, there is nothing to stop for the electrification of WCV, and with suitable political instruments, eWCV could become profitable in the short term.

J	Lister, J				Lister, Jane			The Policy Role of Corporate Carbon Management: Co-regulating Ecological Effectiveness	GLOBAL POLICY			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; SELF-REGULATION; FOSSIL-FUELS; GOVERNANCE; BUSINESS; ORCHESTRATION; INITIATIVES; DISCLOSURE; EMISSIONS; RESPONSES	The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has called for private sector participation in global carbon governance and corporations now seem to be heeding the call at an unprecedented scale. Both critics and proponents of corporate social responsibility (CSR) interpret this as a necessary but uncertain development. Business response has demonstrably failed in the past. Contributing to the CSR and private environmental governance effectiveness literature, this article argues that while voluntary corporate climate governance efforts are essential and improving, they are far from sufficient for meaningful decarbonization. Through an evaluation of the three main underlying corporate carbon management practices (target setting, carbon pricing and carbon reporting), the article highlights how company efforts create business advantage (e.g. risk management) but fall short on ecological effectiveness (i.e. absolute carbon reduction). In response, the paper argues the importance of greater climate policy co-regulation. This includes indirect enabling by governments and the IPCC to encourage incremental improvements in company efforts. It also includes more direct, state-led prescriptive interventions coordinated across supply chains and supported by international organizations, to ensure corporate participation and deeper transformative change to business models, industry structures and consumptive patterns at the root of the global climate crisis.

The synergy between climate change policies and national development goals: Implications for sustainability	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Greenhouse gas emissions; National development; Climate change policies; Renewable energy; Environmental sustainability	CHANGE MITIGATION; COMPATIBLE DEVELOPMENT; CO-BENEFITS; SAUDI-ARABIA; ADAPTATION; EMISSIONS; STRATEGIES; PROJECTS	Climate change mitigation in rapidly growing developing countries is receiving increased global attention, especially after the 2016 Paris Agreement. In Bangladesh, the government has initiated some climate change policies to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in the last decade. However, the rate of emissions has been increasing recently, which questions the emissions reduction potential of these policies. Therefore, this study has utilized relevant indicators to evaluate the extent to which the policies are mitigating climate change, and of their synergy with national development goals. The findings indicate that the policies have limited impacts on energy decarbonization, energy demand management, and emissions sink improvement. Although policies on renewable energy, energy efficiency and demand management, and afforestation are aligned with national development goals, the policies on electricity generation from coal and forest biomass have little synergy with the goals. By quantitatively evaluating the effects of its climate change policies in enhancing socioeconomic, and environmental benefits, this study can assist Bangladesh's policymakers to understand the impact of the policies on climate change mitigation and their level of integration with national development goals. Also, other developing countries can adopt the study methodology to evaluate their climate change policies and track their progress. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Heat pumps can provide heating with higher performance based on their high coefficient of performance (COP). This work considers a multilevel heat pump (MTHP) for multi-source heating, based on a three-stage cascade in which excess heat in the condenser is used for external flows, that can be connected in series or parallel. Several available low GWP refrigerants have been considered, and a multi-parameter selection analysis has been carried out. For low, medium, and high-temperature stages, R1243zf, R-1224yd(Z), and R-1233zd(E) are the best refrigerants, respectively, selected. This system is able to operate between 0 and 160 degrees C, with three heating levels at 60, 110, 160 degrees C (31.75, 21.59, and 29.92 kW, respectively) at a COP of 2.181. The total cooling capacity of the system is 45.08 kW and the total heating capacity is 83.26 kW. The MTHP concept can provide a significant carbon footprint reduction compared to natural gas boilers used in European countries.

However, increasing renewables gives cannibalization and depredation effects. Cannibalization appears when increasing penetration of renewables undermines their own market remuneration. Depredation arises when increased renewable penetration undermines the market remuneration of other technologies. This paper documents cannibalization and depredation effects in the Spanish electricity market from 2014 to 2020. Increases in wind and solar penetration reduce market remuneration of all technologies. With wind, depredation and cannibalization effects are nonlinear. Higher solar and wind penetration reduces remuneration volatility to wind, solar, and gas but increases those of coal and nuclear.

This paper investigates the design of non-fossil fuels processing network with renewable feedstocks under various demand uncertainties in the framework of twostage distributionally robust optimization (TSDRO) model. To handle the difficulties of estimating the exact probability distribution of the considered uncertainties, 1-norm Wasserstein metric is applied to construct the ambiguity set, and the resulting tractability issue is recast in terms of sufficiently expensive recourse and strong duality theorem. Compared with two-stage stochastic programming and two-stage robust optimization, optimal design decisions of the Wasserstein TSDRO of base case and net-zero emission case exhibit the balance between the optimality and robustness, which lay a foundation to ensure an orderly transition towards sustainable and resilient network systems under various demand uncertainties, as well as a pathway to alleviate the abandon or redundancy power phenomena existing in renewable power through employing non-fossil fuels as the storage medium.

The role of local power organizations in energy transition acceleration	TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE			English	Article						Energy transition; Empirical survey; Local power organizations; Spatial dynamics; Public power	ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION; DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS; PROTECTIVE SPACE; POLITICS; INNOVATION; DYNAMICS	A salient problem faced by governments and industry alike is how to accelerate energy transitions to enhance affordability, accessibility, and greenhouse-gas reduction. Bringing together acceleration processes and spatial scale dynamics, this study highlights the potential for electricity distribution to play a keystone role in the energy transition. We present and examine survey data of electricity distribution utilities in a region of the U.S. to show how trends in decentralization and digitization are intertwined with decarbonization. These trends rebalance economic value toward distribution networks and away from centralized infrastructure. The survey data show that electricity distribution organizations are deploying local, renewable generation projects that produce electricity for one-third (1/3) less than the cost from a centralized generation-and-transmission entity. We suggest that this change and others are likely to transform distribution operators into more broad-based local power organizations. Although the cost advantage of distributed generation seemingly marks a future of local control and decentralized organizational forms, spatial scale dynamics indicate countervailing centralization trends, including that distribution networks may evolve to dependency on external digital, engineering, and capital providers. The outcome of the resulting conflicts will affect the potential for transition acceleration to be enabled or reduced.

To assess the decarbonization of the transport sector, a wider range of factors and stakeholder priorities must be considered. A multi-criteria approach shows that car users and vehicle manufacturers are likely to resist e-mobility. However, a decision model based on the multi-criteria approach heavily depends on the characteristics of the car categories and on the weights determining stakeholders' motivations. In practice, neither the exact characteristics nor the exact weights are known exactly. By systematically varying the characteristics and weights, we take these uncertainties into account and test the robustness of the results. Moreover, we identify factors linked to policy measures promoting a particular car technology. Whilst we find that incentivizing the adoption of hybrids is possible, shifting the attitude of car users towards electric vehicles is difficult, since electric vehicles have disadvantages for this stakeholder. Electric utilities support electric vehicles, as they are consistent with their business model whilst government supports them only once ecological and economic concerns gain equal importance. This indicates that new approaches involving penalizing conventional cars may be necessary to the dissemination of electric cars.

Optimal design and allocation of electrified vehicles and dedicated charging infrastructure for minimum life cycle greenhouse gas emissions and cost	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Electric vehicles; Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles; Hybrid electric vehicles		Electrified vehicles can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by shifting energy demand from gasoline to electricity. GHG reduction potential depends on vehicle design, adoption, driving and charging patterns, charging infrastructure, and electricity generation mix. We construct an optimization model to study these factors by determining optimal design of conventional vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and battery electric vehicles (BEVs) with optimal allocation of vehicle designs and dedicated workplace charging infrastructure in the fleet for minimum life cycle cost or GHG emissions over a range of scenarios. We focus on vehicles with similar body size and acceleration to a Toyota Prius under government 5-cycle driving conditions. We find that under the current US grid mix, PHEVs offer only small GHG emissions reductions compared to HEVs, and workplace charging is insignificant. With grid decarbonization, PHEVs and BEVs offer substantial GHG emissions reductions, and workplace charging provides additional benefits. HEVs are optimal or near-optimal for minimum cost in most scenarios. High gas prices and low vehicle and battery costs are the major drivers for PHEVs and BEVs to enter and dominate the cost-optimal fleet. Carbon prices have little effect. Cost and range restrictions limit penetration of BEVs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kii, M				Kii, Masanobu			Reductions in CO(2)Emissions from Passenger Cars under Demography and Technology Scenarios in Japan by 2050	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						passenger car; climate change; CO(2)emissions; low carbon technologies; travel behavior; population decline; aging society; compact city		Climate policy requires substantial reductions in long-term greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including in the transportation sector. As passenger cars are one of the dominant CO(2)emitters in the transport sector, governments and the automobile industry have implemented various countermeasures, including decarbonization of fuels, more energy efficient vehicles, and transport demand management. However, the total impact of these measures in the long term remains unclear. This study aims to clarify the CO(2)emissions reductions from passenger cars by 2050 in 1727 municipalities in Japan under a declining population. To estimate CO(2)emissions, we model travel behavior and traffic situations reflecting the regional conditions of the municipalities, including population density and accessibility to public transport for the base year 2010. Assuming plausible scenarios for future populations and automobile technologies, we estimate CO(2)emissions from passenger cars. We estimate that CO(2)emissions will decline by 64-70% between 2010 and 2050, with automobile technologies playing the largest role. We find that the impact of urban compaction is marginal at the national level but varies by municipality. These results imply that, given regional variations, all countermeasures, including technology and demand management, must be used to achieve the long-term target of CO(2)emissions reductions.

With recent technological advancements in Dynamic Inductive Power Transfer (DIPT) system, EVs can be energised wirelessly by embedding a roadway charging network while travelling in-motion. However, the provision of a viable DIPT system still remains challenging, given the large-scaled investment required and some potential risks involved. This study assesses the economic viability of a DIPT system for EVs through public-private partnership (PPP), by employing a net present value (NPV) framework, to determine the optimal PPP ratio. The PPP model could be considered an effective pathway for leveraging capital, alleviating uncertainties associated with construction and operation, and achieving a nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). New Zealand is used as a real-world case study. Our results indicate that, for a 15-year concession period under PPP where the private investor is expecting a 12.5% return, the government can contribute 9.46% towards the initial investment and charging roadway users a toll of 37 cents/kWh. By implementing the DIPT system, EVs could achieve a significant reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions compared to ICEs. The robustness of the model is validated through Monto Carlo sensitivity analysis.

While the penetration of renewable energy resources is increasing within the national and regional energy mix, emerging digitalization technologies, such as artificial intelligence and blockchain technology are shaping modern power systems. Especially blockchain technology has a very high potential to disrupt the current and future energy sector landscape by enabling various use cases in this domain. This paper aims to prioritize different energy use cases where blockchain technology can actively be utilized to create additional value. This study proposes a Type-2 Neutrosophic Number (T2NN) based Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) to evaluate and rank a set of existing use cases of an energy blockchain system. Testing and validation of the model is done through a comparison against one alternative T2NN based Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) model and an existing approach from literature. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is performed, revealing that changing criteria weightings do not affect the ranking order of the use cases of the energy blockchain system. Prioritizing the use cases can assist the companies, standardization bodies, and related government authorities to make better decisions for their operations, such as ranking the investment decisions.

J	McKenzie, J; Carter, AV				McKenzie, Janetta; Carter, Angela, V			Stepping stones to keep fossil fuels in the ground: Insights for a global wind down from Ireland	EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES AND SOCIETY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Climate policy; Energy governance; Fossil fuels; Ireland; Supply-side climate policy	DYNAMICS	National bans on fossil fuel exploration and/or extraction are a burgeoning policy approach to addressing the climate crisis (Carter and McKenzie 2020). This article focuses on explaining the rise of "keep it in the ground" legislation in Ireland, one of the global first-mover cases. To improve upon its lacklustre climate policy reputation, Ireland has advanced several innovative climate initiatives, including bans on fossil fuel production. Informed by interviews with Irish policymakers, elected officials, researchers, and representatives of civil society, industry, and labour organizations, as well as by previous theoretical work on decarbonization acceleration, we identify conditions that fostered these bans and might be replicated elsewhere. Notably, a diverse and internationally-connected coalition of civil society organizations developed a multi-pronged strategy and locally resonant messages to keep fossil fuels in the ground. The movement was coordinated by a credible organization with political access and built from earlier local campaigns, and was aided by prominent individuals, within and outside of government, who lent legitimacy and policy access to the movement. More broadly, we find that fossil fuel supply curtailment can be achieved by building political momentum through a progression of bills targeting particular fossil fuel projects, fossil fuel investments, then production more generally.

The introduction of electric vehicles (EVs) is an important policy priority for the decarbonization of road transportation. Because high sticker prices restrict EV sales, governments offer consumers EV subsidies. However, some are concerned that subsidies may favor certain groups and industries. Using a conjoint experiment, we examine the public preference for EV subsidies in the U.S. and Japan.,. In the U.S., there is a concern that EV subsidies help the high-income (i.e., individual-focused concerns), while the prevailing concern in Japan is whether they favor foreign companies which are the first movers in the EV industry (i.e., industry-focused concerns). We embed a vignette experiment within the conjoint experiment to prime the respondents with in dividual-and industry-focused distributional concerns. In both countries, regardless of the priming they received, our respondents favor universalistic subsidies that are inclusive of the high-income and luxury/foreign cars to subsidies that are more progressively targeted (i.e., exclusive of the rich and luxury cars) or favoring domestic firms. As such, recent EV policy discourse centering on distributional politics does not appear to reflect public opinion.

J	Baasch, S				Baasch, Stefanie			Energy transition with biomass residues and waste: regional-scale potential and conflicts. A case study from North Hesse, Germany	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY & PLANNING			English	Article						bioenergy; energy transition; energy conflicts; ecological modernization		Bioenergy plays a significant role in the expansion of sustainable energy transitions based on renewable energies, and thus in achieving climate targets through decarbonization of global production and consumption patterns. This article deals with the question of whether and which bioenergy potentials exist and the barriers and preconditions relevant for utilization from a regional perspective based on stakeholder interviews in North Hesse, Germany. Insights were gained into the objectives that regional stakeholders associate with energy recovery from residual and waste materials and the role of ecological modernization in this context. Under current conditions, regional stakeholders assess the potential of biomass residues for energy use as low owing to legal barriers to the use of biomass residues and waste for energy, a high degree of fragmentation, and locally specific design of the uses of these resources. These regional stakeholder assessments contradict the expansion targets and potential calculations of government agencies and research centers. Furthermore, regional stakeholders do not link the expansion of residue- and waste-based bioenergy with ecological modernization objectives (i.e. linking ecological objectives with increases in innovation, growth, and employment), but are mainly driven by the search for cost-savings, improved efficiency, and more sustainable use of biomass residues.

However, assessing the decarbonization value of these measures is a challenge for local policy makers and few local consumption assessment studies integrate a systemic vision. This research presents a multi-criteria city-scale Life Cycle Assessment method focusing on the three largest carbon-emitting sectors in cities: food, residential buildings and daily mobility, with an original combination of databases and models. For food, databases were used to evaluate environmental impacts based on socio-demographic characteristics. For building and mobility, modeling tools were used and adapted at different scales: with local spatial refinement for mobility and the creation of archetypes representing the city's most common residential buildings. A demonstration of this new cross-sectoral method was conducted on Montreuil city in the Parisian region, to (1) evaluate the current greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), and (2) test the possible reductions following different measures. The developed assessment framework provides various interpretation, with disaggregated contribution, mapping, and scenario analysis. For instance, the application of ambitious measures and important lifestyle changes reduced GHG in these sectors by 30%, far from the French government's ambitions of a 55% reduction by 2030.

J	Habermacher, F; Lehmann, P				Habermacher, Florian; Lehmann, Paul			Commitment Versus Discretion in Climate and Energy Policy	ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS			English	Article						Climate change; Public policy; Subsidies; Renewable energy; Uncertainty; Commitment; Hold-up	ADVANCED ABATEMENT TECHNOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL-POLICY; POLITICAL-ECONOMY; SOCIAL COST; PRICES; CARBON; CREDIBILITY; INSTRUMENTS; INCENTIVES; QUANTITIES	To decarbonize the power sector, policy-makers need to commit to long-term credible rules for climate and energy policy. Otherwise, risk of opportunistic policy-making will impair investments into low-carbon technologies. However, the future benefits and costs of decarbonization are subject to substantial uncertainties. Thus, there may also be societal gains from allowing policy-makers the discretion to adjust the policies as new information becomes available. We examine how this trade-off between policy commitment-either unconditional or state-contingent-and discretion affects the optimal intertemporal design of market-based instruments in the power sector. Using a dynamic partial equilibrium model, we show that commitment to a state-contingent level of ambition for the market-based instrument leads to higher welfare than both unconditional commitment and discretion. With benefit uncertainty, the choice between the practically more feasible approaches of unconditional commitment and discretion is analytically ambiguous. A basic numerical illustration suggests that policy discretion may outperform unconditional commitment in terms of welfare. However, this result is reversed when only a limited fraction of benefit uncertainty resolves in reasonable time, when future policy-makers have own agendas, or when investors are risk-averse. With cost uncertainty, policy discretion is welfare-superior if the government can commit to a technology deployment target.

Biomethane injection into natural gas network vs composting and biogas production for electricity in Spain: An analysis of key decision factors	SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY			English	Article						AHP analysis; Biogas; Biomethane; Composting; Natural gas network; SWOT analysis	RENEWABLE ENERGY; ANAEROBIC-DIGESTION; ECONOMIC-ASSESSMENT; WASTE MANAGEMENT; GREEN WASTE; SOLID-WASTE; POLICY; OPPORTUNITIES; EMISSIONS; PLANTS	The challenge of sustainable cities involves rethinking some infrastructure systems and supply chains, including those for energy and waste. In this sense, the injection of green gas as biomethane into the natural gas network could contribute to the reduction of waste in landfills and to the decarbonisation of energy systems. Positive and negative aspects of this challenge have been identified and quantified in comparison with traditional composting and biogas production for electricity, in order to give guidelines to overcome the obstacles that its use shows nowadays. For this, an integrated analytic hierarchy process - strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (AHP-SWOT) analysis, supported by a panel of experts, has been applied. Results have shown the strength derived from the environmental and economic benefits obtained from the by-products, as well as the opportunity of biogas for electricity and biomethane production to generate positive effects on climate change, although the investment and exploitation costs could threaten its implementation. It has been possible to conclude that the use of biomethane in gas networks shows a greater flexibility of use and avoided emissions, so it can become an alternative. Nevertheless, its implementation needs promotion from governments as well as a regulatory framework to support it.	[Fernandez-Gonzalez, J.

Venkata			Augmenting succinic acid production by bioelectrochemical synthesis: Influence of applied potential and CO2 availability	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL			English	Article						Bioelectrochemical synthesis; Bio-production; Electron donor; Applied potential; CO2 fixation; Decarbonization		Bioelectrochemical synthesis offers a promising solution to transform organic and inorganic carbon to high-value added products using microorganisms under a constant applied potential (AP). In the present study, Citrobacter amalonaticus a facultative anaerobic bacterium exhibited its applicability as a biocatalyst in a bioelectrochemical system (BES) for the production of a reduced end product, succinic acid (SA). Influence of decreasing AP from -0.7 to -0.9 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) on SA production was evaluated and external applied potential induced significant enhancement in SA concentration. Highest SA production of 14.4 gL(-1) was observed at an AP of -0.8 V and a further increase in AP led to a decrement in SA concentration. Reductive catalytic currents obtained in chronoamperometry analysis allowed to further acknowledge the influence of AP on electrocatalytic activity and product formation. BES system was comparatively evaluated with a control system (F-Control) lacking electrode assembly and 1.29 fold increment in SA production was observed in BES system. Since CO2 is fixed during SA formation, the influence of its availability on SA yield was studied. Absence of CO2 resulted in the formation of higher acetic acid (6.34 gL(-1)) and lactic acid (6.13 gL(-1)), revealing a direct dependency of SA production on availability of CO2. In addition, use of carbonate as a source of CO2 was also investigated and positive effect on SA concentration (13.6 gL(-1)) was observed. The results suggest that electro fermentative approach could be employed to steer the distribution of reduced metabolic products, which are obtained through valorization of organic substrates and sequestration of CO2, via potentiostatic regulation of redox potential.

Here we examine the evolution and variation of public energy RD&D funding and institutions and associated drivers across eight major economies, including China and India (2000-2018). The share of new clean energy grew at the expense of nuclear, while the fossil fuel RD&D share remained stable. Governments created new institutions but experimented only marginally with novel designs that bridge lab to market to accelerate commercialization. In theory, crisis, cooperation and competition can be drivers of change. We find that cooperation in Mission Innovation is associated with punctuated change in clean-energy RD&D growth, and clean tech competition with China is associated with gradual change. Stimulus spending after the financial crisis, instead, boosted fossil and nuclear only. Looking ahead, global coopetition-the interplay of RD&D cooperation and clean tech competition-offers opportunities for accelerating energy innovation to meet climate goals.

Using the Region of Western Macedonia as a case study, we aimed at providing a holistic approach-as until now only few attempts have been made to systematise the 'Just Transition Plans' in European Union (EU)-for raising awareness on issues related to water resource management in post-lignite areas and analysing the use of hydropower in Greece. Our research draws on a flexible method approach, serving as a tool to identify gaps in current knowledge and practices, based on two stages-first the analysis of existing literature, reviews, and sources from government's core strategies, as well as policy and decision-making papers, and then formulating research questions by synthesising relevant data. In Greece, both 'Just Transition Development Plan of Lignite Areas' and hydropower production practices overlook water resources management. By summarising our findings and identifying gaps that remain in current approaches, this work indicates future directions by suggesting processes necessary for addressing the complex issue of adoption of sustainable water resources management measures in post-lignite eras in accordance with EU's water policy.

China's central government recognizes the need for market-based reforms of the gas sector, but what regulatory and policy adjustments are necessary to reorganize gas supply on a market basis? The textbook approach to energy market reform, and its implementation in the European Union, provides important guidance on how to create a regulatory basis to support competition in gas supply, provided national institutional characteristics are taken into account. This article engages in a comparative analysis of China's gas market reform policies and their implementation at the provincial level, focusing on Guangdong, a laboratory of economic reforms in China. The analysis demonstrates that reforms in 2019-2021 integrated key aspects of the textbook model in China's gas regulations, including third-party access, price deregulation and ownership unbundling. However, the textbook is of limited use to address remaining institutional barriers to reform, including resistance of distribution monopolies to competition from state-owned enterprises. Guangdong's experience shows that reform is possible, but only if accompanied by institutional and pricing adjustments reconciling vested interests with competition.

The government has supported the international agreement by setting and strengthening the domestic policy targets for an earlier peak and faster reduction, aiming to contain the average global temperature increase to well below 2 degrees C. We develop a Kaya Inequality method to assess the time of peak and pace of reduction of China's energy-related CO2 emissions based on the national energy policy targets for 2030. We find that, despite the minor fluctuations, the current plateau essentially represents the peak emissions and should enter a phase of steady decline by around 2025, given current trends in energy consumption and decarbonization. Such developments would be consistent with the strengthened national policy target to achieve 50% of renewable power generation by 2030. However, the basic policy targets - a 20% share of non-fossil energy and 6 Gtce in total energy consumption by 2030 - would be insufficient to peak carbon emissions by around 2030. The synergy and interplay between domestic policy target setting and international climate commitments shed light on the need to elevate national climate ambitions under the Paris Agreement and beyond.

Thus, governments and social agents work on the development and prospective planning of decarbonisation strategies oriented towards sustainable transport. In this regard, the increase in the use of alternative fuels is the recurrent approach to energy planning, e.g. through the promotion of electric vehicles, biofuels, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, etc. However, there is a lack of comprehensive information on the techno-economic performance of production pathways for alternative fuels. The acquisition of robust techno-economic data is still a challenge for energy planners, modellers, analysts and policy-makers when building their prospective models to support decision-making processes. Hence, this article aims to fill this gap through a deep literature review including the most representative production routes for a wide range of road transportation fuels. This led to the development of datasets including investment costs, operating and maintenance costs, and transformation efficiencies for more than 40 production pathways. The techno-economic data presented in this work are expected to be especially useful to those energy actors interested in performing long-term studies on the transition to a sustainable transport system.

Evidence from Chinese cities	RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND FINANCE			English	Article						Low-carbon pilot city; Carbon intensity; Chinese cities; Difference-in-differences	GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS	Low-carbon pilot city (LCPC) programs have been implemented in China to facilitate low carbon production and consumption for combating climate change. The two rounds of low-carbon pilot regions covered six provinces and 36 cities in China. Governments have invested considerable funds and resources to develop LCPCs. Based on panel data from 49 cities for 2005-2018, we employ a matched difference-in-differences approach to explore the effects of the LCPC program on carbon intensity at the city level. Results show that in contrast to the program's goals and expectations, LCPCs significantly increased carbon intensity in both rounds by 15 %-20 % compared with control groups. The growth effect on carbon intensity gradually weakened in the third year following the adoption of the LCPC program. An influential factor analysis indicates that the effects are stronger in eastern coastal cities with improved economic conditions and a reduced proportion of secondary industry production. A series of robustness and placebo tests indicate that the results are robust. We identify possible reasons for this unexpected result, such as preliminary infrastructure construction and development of economic circles. These measures show that the process of decarbonization may result in higher carbon intensity in the short term.

A consequential life cycle approach was employed to examine the implications of an evolving gas supply on the greenhouse gas (GHG) performance of a future United Kingdom (UK) electricity system. Three gas supply mixes were developed based on supply trends, from present day to the year 2050. The contribution of upstream gas emissions- such as extraction, processing/refining,- is not fully reported or covered by UK government legislation. However, upstream gas emissions were seen to be very influential on the future electricity systen-is analysed; with upstream gas emissions per MJ rising between 2.7 and 3.4 times those of the current supply. Increased biomethane in the gas supply led to a substantial reduction in direct fossil emissions, which was found to be critical in offsetting rising upstream emissions. Accordingly, the modelled high shale gas scenario, with the lowest biomethane adoption; resulted in the highest GHG emissions on a life cycle basis. The long-term dynamics of upstream processes are explored in this work to help guide future decarbonisation policies. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The role of new nuclear power in the UK's net-zero emissions energy system	ENERGY			English	Article						Power system; Net-zero energy system; Nuclear power; Variable renewable energy	RENEWABLE ENERGY; LOW-COST; ELECTRICITY; STORAGE; WIND; FEASIBILITY; PENETRATION; TRANSITION; BENEFITS; BURDEN	Swift and deep decarbonisation of electricity generation is central to enabling a timely transition to net-zero emission energy systems. While future power systems will likely be dominated by variable renewable energy (VRE) sources, studies have identified a need for low-carbon dispatchable power such as nuclear. We use a cost-optimising power system model to examine the technoeconomic case for investment in new nuclear capacity in the UK's net-zero emissions energy system and consider four sensitivity dimensions: the capital cost of new nuclear, the availability of competing technologies, the expansion of interconnection and weather conditions. We conclude that new nuclear capacity is only cost-effective if ambitious cost and construction times are assumed, competing technologies are unavailable and interconnector expansion is not permitted. We find that bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and long-term storage could reduce electricity system costs by 5-21% and that synchronous condensers can provide cost-effective inertia in highly renewable systems with low amounts of synchronous generation. We show that a nearly 100% variable renewable system with very little fossil fuels, no new build nuclear and facilitated by long-term storage is the most cost-effective system design. This suggests that the current favourable UK Government policy towards nuclear is becoming increasingly difficult to justify.

Turning a coal state to a green state: Identifying themes of support and opposition to decarbonize the energy system in the United States	ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Climate change; Energy transition; Perceptions; Public opinion; Partisan differences; Indiana	CLIMATE-CHANGE; RENEWABLE ENERGY; PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS; TRANSITIONS; PARTISANSHIP; OPINION; RISK	Decarbonizing the energy system is necessary to address climate change, yet the transition to low-carbon energy resources has been slow, and climate change continues to be a politically polarizing issue in the United States. Past research has shown that people want a future energy mix that is decarbonized but disagree on the policies to get there (Miniard et al., 2020). How do residents of Indiana, a historically Republican state which primarily relies on fossil fuel resources, think about the current and future energy mix and energy policy at the state level? We surveyed and interviewed Indiana residents (N = 48) to identify the motivations and perceptions driving their preferences for energy resources and support or opposition to state and federal energy policies. We find that a majority of participants want a decarbonized state energy mix in 2050 that primarily relies on solar and wind and decreases the use of fossil fuels. Support for decarbonization is driven by themes of protecting the environment and public health, reducing pollution, improving the economy, using low cost and available resources, and holding polluters accountable. We find that climate change is not a strong motivating factor. In contrast, opposition to decarbonization is driven by economic and employment concerns, fear, lack of familiarity, doubting the feasibility of renewable sources, and concerns about fairness. Thus, participants have nuanced reasons driving their support or opposition to decarbonizing the Indiana energy system, which are dependent on the energy source and policy and are not tied to climate change.

J	Xie, Y; Wu, DS; Zhu, SJ				Xie, Yu; Wu, Desheng; Zhu, Shujin			Can new energy vehicles subsidy curb the urban air pollution? Empirical evidence from pilot cities in China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Urban air quality; New energy vehicles; Incentive policy; Pilot city	ELECTRIC VEHICLES; EMISSIONS; IMPACTS; QUALITY; CHALLENGES; TRANSIT; CO2; INFRASTRUCTURE; CONSUMPTION; INCENTIVES	New energy vehicles (NEVs) are considered as the potential measure to address urban air pollution, and the Chinese government has launched a pilot subsidy scheme to improve its market penetration. We explored the environmental effects of subsidy on urban air pollution from the extensive and intensive margins and formulated a detailed panel dataset, covering 286 cities in China over the years 2006-2018. Moreover, the PSM-DID method and the instrumental strategy are used to confirm the robustness and validity of empirical results on the basis of comprehensive analysis of potential endogenous issues. The results indicate that the implementation of NEVs subsidy policy could significantly improve urban air quality in general, and as the subsidies scale increased by 1%, air pollution level will be reduced by about 0.15%. Then, from the perspective of the dynamic effect of subsidy, it not only has remarkable current environmental effect, but also an effective technology route in the long run. Simultaneously, compared with traditional intervention tools, subsidies enhance the diffusion of NEVs, reduce emissions of air pollutants while meeting residents' travel needs, and thus achieve incentive compatibility, which is the micro-foundation of environmental improvement. Nonetheless, we cannot simply believe the assertion that NEVs subsidy has positive environmental benefits to each region, as the non-clean generation of electricity in some areas will offset the potential environmental benefits. Additionally, the accelerated phase-out of NEVs subsidies at this stage may cause negative externalities of economy and environment, resulting the dead-weight loss of industrial dividends accumulated in the early period. Based on above findings, governments should implement more flexible stimulus policies consistent with NEVs industry developments, rather than drastically reducing subsidies, while paying close attention to decarbonization of energy production stage.

Facing the high share of variable renewable energy in the power system: Flexibility and stability requirements	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Variable Renewable Energy; Power System Models; Curtailment	GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; ELECTRICITY-GENERATION; INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT; HIGH PENETRATION; SOLAR POWER; WIND; PLANTS; OPERATIONS; PROGRESS; INERTIA	Power systems with a high share of variable renewable energy (VRE) represent a challenge to system operators because of the increased flexibility requirements and stability. This study analyses the performance of a real power grid with a high penetration of VRE (mainly wind and solar photovoltaic). A rule-based power model is developed to simulate the power system behaviour. One European country was selected (Spain), with limited international interconnections and well-established decarbonisation scenarios by national and European orga-nisations. Flexibility requirements in the future power system were found through power plants' flexibility and stability constraints (i.e., inertia) and the expected changes in grid interconnection. The model results indicate that the ambitious targets for grid decarbonisation are not realistic because of these requirements. Considering the share of VRE for a sustainable transition (ST) scenario in 2030 (33% power generation) and in 2040 (35%), CO2-equivalent emissions will be reduced up to 157 and 159 kg CO2/MWh, respectively, which is well above Paris targets. Furthermore, no scenario allows meeting the expected environmental targets. Therefore, in power systems with more than 39% VRE, the results suggest that new technologies should be considered with emissions below-113 kgCO2/MWh, a maximum cost of-134 euro /MWh, and an inertia constant above 5 s.

A spatially explicit techno-economic optimization tool simulates the EUWB power sector to explore the dispatch of new renewable electricity capacity on a EUWB scale, under ambitious CO2 emission policies. The results show that utility-scale deployment of renewable electricity is feasible and can contribute about 9-39% of the total generation mix, for a carbon price range of 0-200 (sic)/tCO(2) and with the existing capacities of the cross-border transmission network. Even without any explicit carbon incentive (carbon price of 0 (sic)/tCO(2)), more than 35% of the variable power in the most ambitious CO2 mitigation scenario (carbon price of 200 (sic)/tCO(2)) would be economically feasible to deploy. Spatial assessment of bio-electricity potential (based on forest and agriculture feedstock) showed limited presence in the optimal generation mix (0-6%), marginalizing its effect as baseload. Expansion of the existing cross-border transmission capacities helps even out the variability of solar and wind technologies, but may also result in lower installed RE capacity in favor of state-of-the-art natural gas with relatively low sensitivity to increasing carbon taxes. A sensitivity analysis of the investment cost, even under a low-investment scenario and at the high end of the CO2 price range, showed natural gas remains at around 11% of the total generation, emphasizing how costly it would be to achieve the final percentages toward a 100% renewable system.

J	McKinnon, AC				McKinnon, Alan C.			Product-level carbon auditing of supply chains Environmental imperative or wasteful distraction?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL DISTRIBUTION & LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Product specification; Labelling; Supply chain management; Carbon; Global warming		Purpose - Interest in product-level carbon auditing and labelling has been growing in both business and government circles. The purpose of this paper is to examine the practical problems and costs associated with highly disaggregated analyses of greenhouse gas emissions from supply chains. It then weighs these problems and costs against the potential benefits of the carbon labelling of products. Design/methodology/approach - The views expressed in this paper are based on a review of relevant literature, informal discussions with senior managers and personal experience with the practices being investigated. Findings - Stock-keeping unit-level carbon auditing of supply chains and the related carbon labelling of products will be fraught with difficulty and very costly. While simplification of the auditing process, the use of data inventories and software support may assist these processes, the practicality of applying them to all consumer products seems very doubtful. The resulting benefits to companies and consumers are also highly questionable. The main conclusion, therefore, is that product-level carbon auditing and labelling is a "wasteful distraction" and that it would be better to devote management time and resources to other decarbonisation initiatives. Research limitations/implications - To date relatively few firms have carbon audited their supply chains at a product level and so industrial experience is limited. Market research on the likely behavioural response to carbon labelling is also at an early stage. There is sufficient evidence available, however, to conduct an initial critique of product level carbon auditing and labelling. Practical implications - Some companies and government agencies should reconsider their plans for the carbon labelling of products. Originality/value - This is the first paper in the logistics/supply chain literature to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this new form of carbon footprinting and labelling. It is intended to stimulate debate among logistics academics and practitioners.

For example, can the deployment of low carbon solutions deliver economic prosperity and support policy makers in developing decarbonisation policy pathways around which societal and political consensus can build and be sustained? Taking the example of decarbonising private transport in the UK, we use a computable general equilibrium model - informed by energy systems analysis - to consider the potential wider economy impacts, over different timeframes, of electricity network upgrade costs to enable the EV rollout required by 2050. We demonstrate opportunities for both transitory and sustained gains in GDP, employment, and earnings across the UK economy. The key source of sustained expansion is the strength of domestic supply chains supporting the UK electricity sector. However, the transition pathway is sensitive to how network upgrade costs and trajectories respond to the speed of consumer behaviour adjustments, and to the price impacts of constrained wider economy expansion, with notable implications for the price of electricity. The key outcome of concern for UK policymakers is how a lasting constraint on total labour supply means that the EV rollout is associated with lasting impacts on electricity and other consumer prices.

J	Christoff, P; Eckersley, R				Christoff, Peter; Eckersley, Robyn			Convergent evolution: framework climate legislation in Australia	CLIMATE POLICY			English	Article						Australian climate policy; framework climate legislation; climate policy learning; transfer and diffusion; Climate Change Act 2008 (UK); federalism	POLICY DIFFUSION	Australia is a well-known climate laggard with a history of political conflict over climate policy and the dubious distinction of being the only country to repeal a national emissions trading scheme (ETS). This article examines the puzzle of why four subnational governments in Australia's federation succeeded in enacting durable framework climate legislation based on a model that came to be widely regarded as 'best-practice'. We show that in 2007 South Australia was the first jurisdiction in the world to enact framework climate legislation with a 2050 emissions reduction target and an independent expert advisory committee to provide guidance on the implementation of interim targets. We show that this local legislative innovation set off a process of political learning, policy transfer and a virtuous political competition among like-minded Labour and Labour-Green governments at the subnational level. We call this 'convergent evolution' insofar as the legislative innovation and diffusion over the period 2007-2015 was similar to, but occurred independently of, the UK Climate Change Act 2008 and the diffusion of this model elsewhere in Europe. Common to all cases was a strong commitment by the premier and/or the relevant minister to pursue a decarbonisation strategy via targets, and reliance on sources of advice for legislative reform that were professionally and/or politically committed to climate action rather than from vested industry groups. More generally, we argue that framework climate legislation carries lower political risks than an ETS because it does not draw attention to the upfront costs of action. The diffusion of subnational climate change legislation, accompanied by renewable energy promotion, has helped to limit the impacts of Australian national climate policy failure while also providing a springboard for renewed climate legislative momentum at the national level.

The effect of the EU ETS free allowance allocation on energy mix diversification: the case of Poland's power sector	CLIMATE POLICY			English	Article						Synthetic control method; EU ETS; free allowance; lignite; energy mix		Since 2013, power plants in the EU have been obliged to buy carbon permits instead of receiving them for free. However, in order to ease their energy transition, some Member States that meet certain conditions (mainly a high share of fossil fuels and low income) are allowed to continue to receive free allowances for existing power plants (Article 10c of the EU ETS Directive). In exchange, they must invest in modernizing their electricity sector and diversifying their energy supply. However, up to 70% of the conditional investments have been made in upgrading coal-fired units, which casts doubt on the effectiveness of the measure to increase energy diversification. This paper evaluates the effect that the so-called rule 10c has had on energy diversification. A synthetic control method is applied to aggregate data from Poland, one of the countries eligible for free allowances, to investigate how the lignite and wind share in electricity generation would have evolved had Poland not used the rule 10c derogation. Our results indicate that Poland's energy diversification would have been the same if allowances had been auctioned instead of allocated for free. Therefore, the policy is only relevant in political terms and involves unjustified revenue loss for affected governments in favour of installations, i.e. subsidies. Our results suggest that rule 10c, as defined, does not incentivize investment in low carbon alternatives. The use of this transitional free allocation will continue to be available in phase IV (2021-2030) of the EU Emission Trading System (EU ETS). Key policy insights Application of the rule 10c derogation under the EU ETS, granting emission allowances for free to fossil fuel-reliant member states, has not achieved the intended goal of energy mix diversification in Poland. Using a synthetic control method, we show that the lignite and wind share of electricity production in Poland would have followed the same trajectory if full auctioning, instead of free allocation, had been applied. Because most conditional investments were used to retrofit coal-fired plants, the policy's main contribution was to subsidize continued use of coal power. The policy deprived affected governments of auction revenues that could have been used to ease decarbonization.

J	Dunlap, A				Dunlap, Alexander			The green economy as counterinsurgency, or the ontological power affirming permanent ecological catastrophe	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Green economy; Counterinsurgency; Renewable energy; Smart technologies; Climate change	CLIMATE-CHANGE; BIODIVERSITY; POLITICS	As old as industrialism or civilization itself, socio-ecological problems are nothing new. Despite all efforts to resolve environmental dilemmas, socio-ecological catastrophe has only intensified. Governments, in response, have unveiled the green economy to confront ecological and climate catastrophe. The green economy, however, has worsened socio-ecological conditions, invigorating the present trajectory of (techno)capitalist development. This article argues that the green economy serves as a tool of global counterinsurgency, managing, preempting and redirecting the inevitable ecological anxiety that could mobilize for radical social change. While fragmenting ecological opposition, the green economy meanwhile serves as a "force multiplier" for market expansion and capitalist development, as opposed to actually working towards real socio-ecological mitigation and remediation. The article proceeds by defining counterinsurgency, and indicating its relevance to the green economy. Dis-secting the technics of the green economy, the next section reviews its origins and epistemological foundations by investigating the concepts and operationalization of 'energy', 'biodiversity' and 'carbon'. Then, briefly, the article reviews the extractive reality of low-carbon infrastructures, revealing the socio-ecological harm implied and justified by the green economic and decarbonization schemes. The green economy, it concludes, is a governmental technology, preventing collective self-reflection and action to (adequately) rehabilitate ecosystems and address the structural socio-ecological problems threatening the planet, thus preforming a counter -insurrectionary function in the service of state and capital.

First, the thermophysical properties of both fluids were analysed, and a single-stage cycle with Internal Heat Exchanger (IHX) was modelled. Then, a semi-empirical drop-in test replacement was assessed. The low-temperature reservoir was fixed at 80 degrees C, whereas the high-temperature reservoir was varied from 110 to 140 degrees C to cover a wide range of industrial applications. The theoretical and semi-empirical results illustrate that HCFO-1224yd(Z) heating capacity becomes around 8.9% lower than HFC-245fa. However, the higher suction density of HCFO-1224yd(Z) compared to the reference fluid can compensate for this effect, reducing the compressor power consumption. Hence, HCFO-1224yd(Z) presents a COP increase up to 4.5% compared to the reference fluid. At high-temperature reservoir of 140 degrees C, HCFO-1224yd(Z) shows a COP of 2.33, whereas HFC-245fa only reaches 2.23. The carbon footprint assessment illustrates a significant equivalent CO2,eq emissions reduction down to 90%, depending on the country (carbon emission factor). Therefore, HCFO-1224yd(Z) can be used as an alternative to HFC-245fa in HTHP systems due to its beneficial operating, energetic and environmental characteristics. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd and IIR.

The energy sector is the most dominant GHG-emitting sector in the country; its energy consumption has increased over five times in the last four decades, from over 2000 quadrillion joules in 1981 to around 11,000 quadrillion joules in 2019, while the share of renewable energy in 2019 was only 0.1%. To reduce GHG emissions, the Saudi Arabian government has undertaken initiatives for improving energy efficiency and increasing the production of renewable energies in the country. However, there are few investigative studies into the effectiveness of these initiatives in improving energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This study provides an overview of the various energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives undertaken in Saudi Arabia. Then, it evaluates the effectiveness of energy-related policies and initiatives using an indicator-based approach. In addition, this study performs temporal and econometrics analyses to understand the trends and the causal relationships among various drivers of energy sector emissions. Energy intensity and efficiency have improved moderately in recent years. This study will support policymakers in identifying significant policy gaps in reducing the emissions from the energy sector; furthermore, this study will provide a reference for tracking the progress of their policy initiatives. In addition, the methodology used in this study could be applied in other studies to evaluate various climate change policies and their progress.

J	La Rovere, EL				La Rovere, Emilio Lebre			Low-carbon development pathways in Brazil and 'Climate Clubs'	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article								Brazil occupies a unique position among the major greenhouse gas (GHG) emitting countries due to its low per-capita energy-related GHG emissions (2.4 tons CO2 in 2014), attributable to abundant clean energy sources. Recently, deforestation in Brazil has slowed considerably, to the point where forestry has ceased to be the major source of emissions. Brazil has reduced its overall GHG emissions by 41% from 2005 to 2012, and its total GHG emissions per capita decreased from a high in 2004 of 14.4 tCO(2)e to an estimated 6.5 tCO(2)e in 2012. Brazil faces the challenge of building upon its historically low energy-related GHG emission levels through new decarbonization strategies, while pursuing higher living standards for its population. There is a huge potential to further reduce national GHG emissions through the implementation of a wide spectrum of mitigation measures. While several observers from the scientific community have a different view, Brazilian government considers that the country has been playing both a pioneer and a leader role in ambitious climate action, including the submission of a quite ambitious intended nationally determined contribution, and a constructive role played in COP21, joining the High Ambition club at the end of the negotiations. Several motivations exist for Brazil joining other ` climate clubs' focusing on innovative financial mechanisms and sustainable energy and forestry technologies. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Towards green whiskey production: Anaerobic digestion of distillery by-products and the effects of pretreatment	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Whiskey by-products; Anaerobic digestion; Pretreatment; Microbial community; Decarbonization	DILUTE SULFURIC-ACID; BIOMETHANE PRODUCTION; ALKALI PRETREATMENT; METHANE PRODUCTION; ENERGY RECOVERY; DRIED GRAINS; STILLAGE; FERMENTATION; BIOMASS; BIOHYDROGEN	Using renewable biogas from the anaerobic digestion of distillery by-products as a low-carbon heat source can decarbonize the distillery process and support the distillery industry to transition to a more sustainable production process. This study investigated the anaerobic digestion performance of different types of whiskey byproducts and the effects of acid pretreatment on the digestion of solid by-products. Results of biomethane potential assays showed that the methane yield from the unprocessed by-products was 330 mL/g volatile solids (VS) from draff, 495 mL/g VS from thin stillage, and 503 mL/g VS from thick stillage. For the processed by-products the specific methane yield was 370 mL/g VS from cake maize, 382 mL/g VS from wet distillers' grains with solubles (WDGS), and 545 mL/g VS from syrup. Acid pretreatment (1% H2SO4 at 135 C for 15 min) did not significantly improve the methane yield from solid by-products (such as draff and WDGS) but reduced the digestion time by 54.5% for cake maize. The microbial community analysis revealed that methane production from the untreated and acid-pretreated solid by-products (draff and WDGS) was mainly through the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway. The gross thermal energy in the form of methane produced from 100 tonnes of mixed unprocessed by-products (draff, thin stillage, and thick stillage) was calculated as 24.4 MW(th)h equivalent to 60.6% of the thermal energy consumed in whiskey production, which effected the same percentage of CO2 emissions reduction.

J	Lindner, R				Lindner, Robert			Green hydrogen partnerships with the Global South. Advancing an energy justice perspective on "tomorrow's oil"	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Africa; development partnership; energy justice; energy transition; foreign aid; Global South; green hydrogen	TRANSITIONS; TECHNOLOGIES; FRAMEWORKS; INSIGHTS; POLITICS; ECONOMY; THEMES; POLICY; WORLD	Fuel cells and other hydrogen-based technologies are increasingly seen as a key pillar of global decarbonization efforts. A major challenge to be overcome is the future availability of large quantities of affordable green hydrogen to supply the envisioned hydrogen economy. Several industrialized countries have formulated ambitious national hydrogen strategies that rely heavily on importing green hydrogen from other countries, including countries in the Global South that are rich in renewable energy. This paper is based on an extensive literature review and policy analysis. It provides the first structured overview of existing and emerging North-South green hydrogen partnerships and analyzes them through the lens of energy justice theory. The findings show that international collaboration has increased significantly in recent years, with a clear focus on Brazil, Egypt, India, and Morocco. Partnerships are led by both government and private sector actors and mainly take the form of pilot projects, feasibility studies, and scientific collaboration. The paper also points out that existing partnerships have several shortcomings, such as the lack of sociopolitical considerations and the dominance of donor economic priorities over sustainable development in partner countries. Finally, the paper discusses how an energy justice perspective could help improve future partnership approaches to achieve the twin goals of global climate change mitigation and sustainable development in the Global South.

A BREDEM-based dwelling energy model, incorporating a model of heat pump performance, is enhanced for the effects of varying monthly temperatures. Data from the English Housing Survey (2007) are analysed using this model to estimate electricity consumption to 2020 and 2050, and simulate scenarios for replacing existing heating systems by ground or air source heat pumps. The type of heat pump (ground or air source) is determined by dwelling plot dimensions data from the EHS. Modelling results for 2020 showed that a policy of replacing the heating systems with the highest emissions could reduce or at least minimise the increase in electricity consumption and carbon emissions. Results for 2050 showed that replacement of some 80% of current gas-fired systems would enable the UK to meet its target of 80% carbon emissions reduction in this sector when accompanied by simultaneous decarbonisation of the electricity supply. These results provide some support for the UK government's policy of subsidizing heat pump installations through the Renewable Heat Incentive payments while indicating that meeting emission targets requires far greater adoption of these systems than current ambitions.

J	Oke, D; Dunn, JB; Hawkins, TR				Oke, Doris; Dunn, Jennifer B.; Hawkins, Troy R.			The contribution of biomass and waste resources to decarbonizing transportation and related energy and environmental effects	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS			English	Article							REDUCTIONS	Various technologies to reduce emissions from the transportation sector have emerged in the past decades, including biofuels and electric vehicles. Electrification is vital to decarbonization, but it is insufficient alone and may not apply to all transportation sectors. There is considerable interest in biofuels to complement electrification in decarbonizing transportation. In this study, we evaluate the extent to which biomass can contribute to the decarbonization of the transportation sector as electrification of the light-duty fleet increases. Using two biomass availability scenarios established at two different price points (<=$40 per dry ton and <=$60 per dry ton), the study examines how electrification and biomass resources can be used to meet near-term societal transportation needs when biomass use is prioritized towards different transportation sectors. We consider the transportation sector as a whole, including the light-duty, heavy-duty, marine, and aviation sectors. The results show that biofuels could fulfill about 27% of energy demand across the heavy-duty, aviation, and marine sector at <=$40 per dry ton and more than 50% at <=$60 per dry ton by 2050, while electrification could be the primary means of decarbonizing light-duty vehicles. While in 2050 transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions could be 26% lower than in the baseline case with extensive electrification of the light-duty sector, this percentage could be increased to 37% and 52% at <=$40 per dry ton and <=$60 per dry ton, respectively, with increased market penetration of biofuels in the other transportation sectors.

Identification of opportunities for integrating chemical processes for carbon (dioxide) utilization to nuclear power plants	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS			English	Article						CO2; Integrated energy systems; Energy-to-molecules; Catalysis; Electrocatalysis; Radiolysis; Heat integration; Electricity integration; Radiation integration; CO2 utilization	HYDROGEN-PRODUCTION SYSTEM; HIGH-TEMPERATURE REACTOR; UP TEST FACILITY; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; ELECTROCHEMICAL REDUCTION; INDUCED CARBOXYLATION; CONTROLLABILITY TEST; RADIATION-CHEMISTRY; CONTROL TECHNOLOGY; CO2 HYDROGENATION	The energy and industrial sectors are responsible for more than 75% of global carbon dioxide emissions, which are primary contributors to climate change. Decarbonization strategies to reduce overall carbon dioxide emissions are urgently needed. Among the numerous decarbonization strategies that are being defined and implemented, a particular strategy of interest for the present work is "the Re-X or zero waste" strategy, which involves recycling, reuse, repurposing, and remanufacturing of industrial emissions, by-products, and waste in general. A circular value chain or Circular Economy is embedded within this strategy. In a circular carbon economy, efficient reuse of emitted carbon dioxide is considered. However, the stability of carbon dioxide implies the requirement of significant amounts of energy for its transformation into value-added chemicals or products, which must be supplied by low carbon emitting energy sources. Nuclear power plants are low carbon energy sources that, additionally to electricity, could also supply heat and radiation for chemical transformations. This work identifies the opportunities and challenges for the development of integrated energy systems to upgrade and transform carbon dioxide, involving chemical and nuclear energy. The analysis encompasses possible use of the different forms of energy that can be obtain from nuclear reactors (i.e., radiation, electricity, and heat), by reviewing the published literature on potential routes for its conversion. Our review indicates that an universal technology of the one-fits-all solution-type is an utopic dream. Instead, a suite of (contaminants tolerant) technologies for processing various concentrations CO2 and producing a variety of products is currently needed.	[Ramirez-Corredores, M.

J	Rampini, C				Rampini, Costanza			Climate and energy justice along the Brahmaputra river in Northeast India	ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING E-NATURE AND SPACE			English	Article						Brahmaputra; floods; hydropower; climate adaptation; Northeast India	SUSTAINABLE ADAPTATION; HYDROPOWER DEVELOPMENT; SOLAR-ENERGY; VULNERABILITY; MANAGEMENT; POLITICS; FLOOD; POWER; DAMS; RESILIENCE	Recurrent summer floods along the Brahmaputra river and its tributaries are a major challenge for the people and state governments of Northeast India. While riverine communities in the region rely upon a variety of adaptation strategies to live with these destructive floods, climate change is expected to further exacerbate this challenge, as melting Himalayan glaciers and changes in the South Asian monsoon lead to an increase in the frequency of severe floods. At the same time, a multitude of new dams are under construction in the Brahmaputra river basin, to meet India's growing energy demands. Though these dams could provide flood protection for downstream communities, political and economic factors have led dam-builders to prioritize hydroelectricity generation over flood control. Furthermore, hydroelectricity generated along the Brahmaputra is "evacuated" to distant urban centers, while rural dwellers in Northeast India suffer from high levels of energy poverty. Using the Ranganadi Hydroelectric Project in Arunachal Pradesh as a case study, this paper examines how, by changing the flood regime and undermining current adaptive strategies, large dams along the Brahmaputra are testing the capacity of downstream communities to live with summer floods. This work highlights the ways in which poor and vulnerable communities in Northeast India are forced to bear the costs of both climate change impacts and decarbonization efforts.

J	Rocco, MV; Tonini, F; Fumagalli, EM; Colombo, E				Rocco, Matteo V.; Tonini, Francesco; Fumagalli, Elena M.; Colombo, Emanuela			Electrification pathways for Tanzania: Implications for the economy and the environment	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Sustainable growth; Electricity availability; Input-output model; Household consumption habits; Tanzania	ELECTRICITY; ENERGY; SYSTEM; POWER	The role of electricity availability in promoting the economic growth of low-income countries is a highly debated issue. Taking the Tanzanian government's view that a lack of infrastructure for power generation, together with a low electrification rate, are a limitation to growth, this paper studies the implications on the country's sustainable development of expanding the electricity sector. The analysis is based on the joint use of the OSeMOSYS open-source power system optimization model and the Leontief Input-Output model (based on the Tanzanian Social Accounting Matrix). Four scenarios are considered, representative of alternative technological and environmental policies, characterized by different timing to achieve full electrification. Results indicate that while an expansion of the electricity sector can contribute significantly to economic growth, the associated direct and indirect growth in carbon emissions is equally remarkable. Relying on the country's renewable generation potential would be important but might not be sufficient to lower the economy-wide carbon intensity, particularly under the assumption of reaching full access already in 2030. Targeting energy efficiency and/or decarbonization efforts in the industrial sectors as well as in the provisions of services would also be necessary. The latter is particularly relevant as, per effect of an average income increase, household consumption habits contributes to drive the economy away from its traditional, agricultural base.

J	Charlesworth, KE; Jamieson, M				Charlesworth, Kate E.; Jamieson, Maggie			Healthcare in a carbon-constrained world	AUSTRALIAN HEALTH REVIEW			English	Article								Objective The climate crisis necessitates urgent decarbonisation. The health sector must address its large carbon footprint. In the present study, we sought healthcare thought leaders' views about a future environmentally sustainable health system. Methods The present study was a qualitative exploratory study consisting of semistructured, in-depth interviews with 15 healthcare thought leaders from Australia, the UK, the US and New Zealand. Audio recordings of the interviews were transcribed and analysed by matrix display and thematic analysis. Results Overall, healthcare thought leaders believe that to reduce the carbon footprint of healthcare we need to look beyond traditional green' initiatives towards a more fundamental and longer-term redesign. Five main themes and one key enabler' (information communication technology) were identified. In this paper we draw on other relevant findings, but chiefly focus on the fifth theme about reshaping the role of healthcare within society and using the size and influence of the health sector to leverage wider health, environmental and societal benefits. Conclusions These ideas represent potentially low-carbon models of care. The next step would be to pilot and measure the outcomes (health, environmental, financial) of these models. What is known about the topic? The health sector needs to reduce its large carbon footprint. Traditional green' initiatives, such as recycling and improving energy efficiency, are insufficient to achieve the scale of decarbonisation required. What does this paper add? Healthcare thought leaders surveyed in the present study suggested that we also consider other, non-traditional ways to achieve environmental sustainability. In this paper we discuss their ideas about adopting an anticipatory approach to healthcare using predictive analytics, and using the size and influence of the health sector to effect wider health and environmental benefits. What are the implications for practitioners? Achieving an environmentally sustainable healthcare system is likely to require broad and fundamental (i.e. transformational) change to the current service model. Health practitioners throughout the sector must be closely engaged in this process.

Three CaO-based materials (two types of lime and calcined raw meal) with different textural properties and therefore, different CO2 carrying capacities have been fed to the entrained flow reactor in a series of tests in which the Ca/CO2 molar ratio and solid residence time were the operation variables studied. Up to 11 mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) has been captured from the gas phase with CaO from calcined lime with a maximum CO2 carrying capacity of 0.57 mol CO2 per mol CaO, reaching CO2 capture efficiencies over 90% for a Ca/CO2 molar ratio of 5 and solid residence times under 5 s.

J	Kumar, S; Loosen, M; Madlener, R				Kumar, Subhash; Loosen, Maximilian; Madlener, Reinhard			Assessing the potential of low-carbon technologies in the German energy system	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						CO2 mitigation; EnergyPlan model; Energy systems; Germany; Low carbon technologies; Smart grid	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY; EMISSIONS; MODEL; OPTIMIZATION; TRANSITION; INNOVATION; SIMULATION; CHINA	With the introduction of its energy concept in 2010, the German government set ambitious targets for the country's energy and climate policy. According to this concept, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will have to be reduced by 80% by 2050, as compared to 1990 levels, and renewables will have to supply 80% of all electricity needs by the same year. Additionally, Germany has decided to phase out its nuclear energy by 2022. This study investigates the possible components to achieve these targets. The analysis is based on an hourly simulation model EnergyPlan. Three scenarios are developed to investigate the potential development of the German energy supply system until 2050. The results indicate renewable shares of 92% and 81% for scenarios B and A, respectively, by 2050 compared to 69% in the reference scenario. The proposed renewable energy system is even found to involve lower costs than today's energy system (i.e. total annual cost for scenario B is (sic) 260 bn compared to (sic) 293 bn in the reference scenario). The results show that a massive decarbonization of the German energy system until 2050 seems technically and economically feasible, if smart grid costs are disregarded and if this sustainable energy transformation is accompanied by political and genuine public willingness to actually achieve the set goals and take the necessary steps.

The energy transition as fiscal rupture: Public services and resilience pathways in a coal company town	ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Coal transition; Fiscal impacts; Public services; Community resilience; Resource peripheries	COMMUNITY RESILIENCE; BOOMTOWN IMPACTS; GOVERNANCE; QUALITY; ECONOMY; OIL	In fossil-fuel dependent communities and regions, decarbonization of the U.S. energy system has triggered processes of deindustrialization and economic restructuring. Recent scholarship has emphasized the risks asso-ciated with fiscal dependence on fossil fuel revenue for such areas, however, the specific ways fiscal risk affects local conditions have not yet been described. This paper responds to calls for increased attention to social and economic disruptions experienced in legacy fossil fuel communities. We apply community resilience and tran-sition theory to a case study of the fiscal impacts of the coal transition in Colstrip, Montana, USA. Our mixed -methods approach incorporates historical narrative, fiscal data, and policy analysis with key informant in-terviews. The study observes the historical decision-nodes leading to present-day dependence and characterizes the resulting fiscal impact of the coal industry decline and decision-making environment regarding public ser-vices and infrastructure. We find that local government's fiscal dependence on coal revenue contributes to path dependencies in service provision which undermine community resilience and development potential in the context of transitional rupture. The fiscal policy landscape creates a fragmented and uncoordinated decision -making environment that drains limited resources and capacity and creates barriers to consensus-building. This research highlights the need for formal transition impact assessments to support decision-making in place-based transitions and provides a starting template for an associated public revenue analysis.

Uncertainties around technical learning rates; consumer behaviour; and the strategic interactions of governments, automakers and fuel providers are particularly acute. System dynamics and agent-based models, and studies of historical alternative fuel transitions, have furthered our understanding of possible transition dynamics, but these types of analysis exclude broader systemic issues concerning energy system evolution (e. g. supplies and prices of low-carbon energy) and the politics of transitions. This paper presents a hybrid approach to assessing hydrogen transitions in the UK, by linking qualitative scenarios with quantitative energy systems modelling using the UK MARKAL model. Three possible transition pathways are explored, each exploring different uncertainties and possible decision points, with modelling used to inform and test key elements of each scenario. The scenarios draw on literature review and participatory input, and the scenario structure is based on archetypal transition dynamics drawn from historical energy system transitions, reflecting insights relating to innovation system development and resistance to change.

J	Lee, T; Kim, KT				Lee, Taesong; Kim, Kyu Tae			High-frequency transverse combustion instabilities of lean-premixed multislit hydrogen-air flames	COMBUSTION AND FLAME			English	Article						Combustion instability; Decarbonization; Gas turbine combustion; Hydrogen; Multislit; Transverse mode	EXCITED AZIMUTHAL MODES; LARGE-EDDY SIMULATION; DYNAMICS; TECHNOLOGY; ENRICHMENT; METHANE; AMMONIA	The present experimental investigation is concerned with combustion dynamics of lean-premixed multislit hydrogen-air flames, with the aim of addressing some of the central technical problems associated with the development of low-emission carbon-free gas turbine combustion technology. To mitigate flashback risk in relatively fast premixed hydrogen flames, we use a multislit injector assembly with a slit width of 1.5 mm, of the same order of magnitude as the characteristic thickness of lean-premixed hydrogen flames. This new perspective on the characteristic nozzle dimension makes it possible to scrutinize the dynamics of multisheet hydrogen flames under extreme conditions. We carry out extensive measurements of self-excited pressure oscillations over a broad range of operating conditions between 30 and 100 kW thermal power. The experimental datasets are analyzed using the acoustic wave decomposition method, low-order thermoacoustic network modeling, and FEM-based three-dimensional Helmholtz simulations. We show that lean-premixed multislit hydrogen flames - unlike the multi-element hydrogen-air flame ensembles considered in our earlier investigations - undergo strong high-frequency pressure oscillations between 3.1 and 3.5 kHz in excess of 25 kPa, originating from the triggering of the first tangential mode of the combustion chamber. Whereas the frequency of the first tangential mode is well defined by the square root dependence of adiabatic flame temperature, the magnitude of pressure fluctuations is observed to be intensified exponentially with increasing flame temperature up to 2200 K. We demonstrate that the transverse mode is characterized by high-amplitude spinning modes in the clockwise direction under relatively short combustor length conditions, discontinuously switching to counter-clockwise spinning modes at relatively long combustor length, and eventually transitioning to a moderate standing wave mode at the same resonant frequency. These observations demonstrate the previously unidentified complex modal dynamics induced by lean-premixed multislit hydrogen-air flames of nozzle dimension comparable to the characteristic length scale of the flame.

In contrast with exhaust gases heat recovery, radiant waste heat has typically not been used. This energy waste is found in energy intensive processes in which high temperatures are reached. For instance, in the steel making process, the cast steel is red hot and emits a considerable amount of radiant energy. In this paper the conceptual design of a radiant heat capturing device is presented. This device enables the recovery of currently unused energy while solving the radiative emission-related problems. The achieved design gets to an optimized solution regarding view factors and optical properties of the involved surfaces. In this research work, those factors are optimized to maximize the amount of heat recovered by the presented device. Simulation tools are used to test different designs and define the most appropriate solution for a given case.

A Review of the Latest Trends in the Use of Green Ammonia as an Energy Carrier in Maritime Industry	ENERGIES			English	Article						green ammonia; ammonia as an energy carrier; decarbonisation; International Maritime Organisation		This review paper examines the key barriers to using green ammonia as an alternative fuel in maritime industry. A literature survey is performed based on research articles and grey literature, with the aim of discussing the technoeconomic problems with and benefits of ammonia and the relevant technologies. The limitations of ammonia as a maritime fuel and its supply chain, the expected percentage demand by 2030 and 2050, its economic performance compared to other shipping fuels such as hydrogen, and the current regulations that may impact ammonia as a maritime fuel are discussed. There are several key barriers to ammonia's wide adoption: (1) High production costs, due to the high capital costs associated with ammonia's supply chain; (2) availability, specifically the limited geographical locations available for ammonia bunkering; (3) the challenge of ramping up current ammonia production; and (4) the development of ammonia-specific regulations addressing issues such as toxicity, safety, and storage. The general challenges involved with blue ammonia are the large energy penalty and associated operational costs, and a lack of technical expertise on its use. Regardless of the origin, for ammonia to be truly zero-carbon its whole lifecycle must be considered-a key challenge that will aid in the debate about whether ammonia holds promise as a zero-carbon maritime fuel.

Several approaches have been explored to improve their efficiency and power density, and recently, cell geometry modification has shown promise in efforts to address mass transport limitations which affect electrochemical and overall system performance. Flow-by electrode configurations have demonstrated significant power density improvements in laboratory testing, however, flow-through designs with conductive felt remain the standard at commercial scale. Concentration gradients exist within these cells, limiting their performance. A new concept of redistributing reactants within the flow frame is introduced in this paper. This research shows a 60% improvement in minimum V3+ concentration within simulated vanadium redox flow battery (VRB/VRFB) cells through the application of static mixers. The enhanced reactant distribution showed a cell voltage improvement by reducing concentration overpotential, suggesting a pathway forward to increase limiting current density and cycle efficiencies in RFBs.

One of them is the behavior of the material itself, being the volume change of the PCM when changing phase an identified potential problem for some applications. This paper analyses the volume change of four organic PCM with different nature (paraffin, polymer, sugar alcohol, and aromatic hydrocarbon) in the laboratory and compares the results with observations at pilot plant scale. This study shows that the volume change of solid-liquid PCM cannot be generalised to be 10% as generally found in the literature, since materials show volume change that can go from near negligible up to 24%.

There is a rather limited consideration of the perceptions of households, which play a large role in this sector. This in turn may affect the effectiveness of policy in-struments. This study contributes to a better understanding of the various perceptions held by key stakeholders, in particular about what can be done to reduce residential heating bills and how. We use a participatory method based on Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM), which accounts for the behavioural complexity of the transition in residential heating and provides a better understanding of policy instruments in terms of stakeholder perception. We then test combinations of policy instruments based on expert opinion and identify the most effective ones based on their perceptions. Our analysis indicates that environmental education and information are perceived to reduce heating bills by a very significant amount. Taxes are perceived to be more effective than subsidies. We also show that policy packages are considered essential: when policy instruments are combined the effects perceived are cumulative, resulting in a much greater expected impact on heating bills and energy consumption.

J	Maestre, VM; Ortiz, A; Ortiz, I				Maestre, Victor M.; Ortiz, Alfredo; Ortiz, Inmaculada			The role of hydrogen-based power systems in the energy transition of the residential sector	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Review						renewable hydrogen; residential and buildings sector; fuel cell; self-sufficiency; technical feasibility; cost-competitiveness	FUEL-CELL; COST-ANALYSIS; TECHNOLOGIES; PERFORMANCES; OPTIMIZATION; STORAGE; DESIGN; OXIDE	The unsustainable and continuous growth of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) has pushed governments, private companies and stakeholders to adopt measures and policies to fight against climate change. Within this framework, increasing the contribution of renewable energy sources (RES) to final consumed energy plays a key role in the planned energy transition. Regarding the residential sector in Europe, 92% of GHG emissions comes from 75% of the building stock that is over 25 years old, and highly inefficient. Thus, this sector must raise RES penetration from the current 36% to 77% by 2050 to comply with emissions targets. In this regard, the hybridization of hydrogen-based technologies and RES represents a reliable and versatile solution to facilitate decarbonization of the residential sector. This study provides an overview and analysis of standalone renewable hydrogen-based systems (RHS) focusing on the residential and buildings sector, as well as critical infrastructures like telecom stations, data servers, etc. For detailed evaluation of RHS, several pilot plants and real demonstration plants implemented worldwide are reviewed. To this end, a techno-economic assessment of relevant parameters like self-sufficiency ratio, levelized cost of energy and hydrogen roundtrip efficiency is provided. Moreover, the performance of the different configurations is evaluated by comparing the installed power of each component and their energy contribution to cover the load over a defined period of time. Challenges ahead are identified for the wider deployment of RHS in the residential and buildings sector. (c) 2021 The Authors.

Techno-economic Analysis of Sustainable Biofuels for Marine Transportation	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						heavy fuel oil; marine biofuels; decarbonization; techno-economic analysis; sustainability	FUELS; LIQUEFACTION; PYROLYSIS; GAS	Renewable, low-carbon biofuels offer the potential opportunity to decarbonize marine transportation. This paper presents a comparative techno-economic analysis and process sustainability assessment of four conversion pathways: (1) hydro-thermal liquefaction (HTL) of wet wastes such as sewage sludge and manure; (2) fast pyrolysis of woody biomass; (3) landfill gas Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; and (4) lignin-ethanol oil from the lignocellulosic ethanol biorefinery utilizing reductive catalytic fractionation. These alternative marine biofuels have a modeled minimum fuel selling price between $1.68 and $3.98 per heavy fuel oil gallon equivalent in 2016 U.S. dollars based on a mature plant assessment. The selected pathways also exhibit good process sustainability performance in terms of water intensity compared to the petroleum refineries. Further, the O and S contents of the biofuels vary widely. While the non-HTL biofuels exhibit negligible S content, the raw biocrudes via HTL pathways from sludge and manure show relatively high S contents (>0.5 wt %). Partial or full hydrotreatment can effectively lower the biocrude S content. Additionally, co-feeding with other low-sulfur wet wastes such as food waste can provide another option to produce raw biocrude with lower S content to meet the target with further hydrotreatment. This study indicates that biofuels could be a cost-effective fuel option for the marine sector. Marine biofuels derived from various feedstocks and conversion technologies could mitigate marine biofuel adoption risk in terms of feedstock availability and biorefinery economics.	[Tan, Eric C.

J	Welton, S				Welton, Shelley			PUBLIC ENERGY	NEW YORK UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; MUNICIPAL OWNERSHIP; UTILITY-COMMISSION; ELECTRIC UTILITIES; LOCAL-GOVERNMENTS; STATE-REGULATION; PRIVATE; ACCOUNTABILITY; FEDERALISM; INNOVATION	Many scholars and policy makers celebrate cities as loci for addressing climate change. In addition to being significant sources of carbon pollution, cities prove to be dynamic sites of experimentation and ambition on climate policy. However, as U.S. cities set climate change goals far above those of their federal and state counterparts, they are butting up against the limits of their existing legal authority, most notably with regard to control over energy supplies. In response, many U.S. cities are exercising their legal rights to reclaim public ownership or control over private electric utilities as a method of achieving their climate change goals. Although there is widespread desire for cities to act within their legal authority to reduce carbon pollution, it is a different question entirely whether they should be encouraged to expand this authority by reclaiming ownership or control over tasks previously outsourced to private companies. On this question, energy law has much to learn from administrative law's robust attention to outsourcing theory. This Article draws from the outsourcing literature to argue that climate change complicates traditional theories regarding whether cities should prefer publicly or privately owned electricity systems. By transposing these theories into energy law, it constructs a theoretical defense of why more public forms of energy ownership or control may be effective governance tools for the climate change era. In the last century, providing electricity was a task well suited to government oversight of private companies, as regulators primarily aimed to incentivize low prices and adequate supply. This century, however, climate change creates the need for more deliberative, experimental management of electricity to meet the additional aim of decarbonization while maintaining affordability and reliability. In this situation, outsourcing theory widely counsels against utilizing a private contractor model, and illustrates the difficulties inherent in using regulation to manage private companies. Instead, it is time for broader reconsideration of more public forms of energy control and ownership, of just the sort that leading U.S. cities are pioneering.

Moreover, low global warming potential (GWP) alternatives offer a more environmentally friendly option as refrigerants. HFO-1234ze(E) and its non-flammable mixture R-515B are experimentally investigated for the first time to replace HFC-134a in heat pump water heaters (HPWH) and moderately high temperature heat pumps (MHTHP). Tests are performed in a test rig equipped with a variable frequency compressor at evaporating temperatures of 7.5, 15 and 22.5 degrees C and condensing temperatures from 55 to 85 degrees C (65 experimental tests). HFC-134a outperforms both alternatives in heating capacity (approx. 26% higher) due to the higher mass flow rate and heating effect. However, this effect is compensated by, on average, 25% lower compressor power consumption. Therefore, the coefficient of performance (COP) is comparable or slightly higher (up to 5%) for HFO-1234ze(E) and R-515B. Considering the positive results in COP and the reduced GWP, both options decrease HFC-134a MHTHP equivalent carbon emissions down to 28%. Besides, given the 20 K lower discharge temperature reached by the alternatives, the compressor operating map can be significantly extended. Finally, it is demonstrated that R-515B is a suitable non-flammable alternative to HFO1234ze(E) that keep energetic and environmental benefits while offers a safer system operation.

The present paper presents an innovative top-down methodology, the MSF455 model, which estimates the new vessel Operational Expenditure (OPEX) as per the provisions of the Fit for 55 package and various scenarios based on carbon tax, penalty allowances, maritime fuel tax and effect. The methodology is presented and tested against six scenarios that are based on Det Norske Veritas's (DNV) fuel maritime projections. The model illustrates that the distinction between intra-EU and extra-EU penalty allowance creates a large disparity and thus reduction in the competitiveness of goods (produced and transported).

EU energy policy has provided a wide range of measures to achieve an integrated energy market and sustainability of the building sector. Various incentives and financial instruments have been promoted and financed by governments to help consumers in energy retrofit processes. These include direct investments and fiscal, financial, and market instruments. Public measures have been widely studied but private initiatives have not. In this study, the energy-efficiency mortgage (EEM) is investigated as a credit scheme to attract young people to a real estate market for sustainable buildings, characterized by high sale prices. A choice experiment (CE) was modelled to investigate the preferences of potential young buyers of a new home. The results of this exploratory survey showed an appreciation of the purchase of new A-rated properties according to the Energy Performance Certificate, compared to those that need to be retrofitted or not retrofitted. Consumers like the option of a home energy efficiency renovation being fully managed by a third party (i.e., following the one-stop shop model). The key appeal of energy efficiency for consumers ranges from its ability to support better energy management, to better property value management. The EEM seems to be a promising tool to stimulate investments in energy efficiency and to promote the accessibility and affordability of housing in the sustainable housing market. The results of this study can help private financial institutions to propose appropriate credit plans, which limit the risk of default by the borrower. They can also help public incentive policymakers to propose complementary instruments to EEM.

In the lead up to the twenty-first Conference of the Parties, the Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project developed mid-century low-emission pathways for 16 countries, based on an innovative pathway design framework. In this Perspective, we describe this framework and show how it can support the development of sectorally and technologically detailed, policy-relevant and country-driven strategies consistent with the Paris Agreement climate goal. We also discuss how this framework can be used to engage stakeholder input and buy-in; design implementation policy packages; reveal necessary technological, financial and institutional enabling conditions; and support global stocktaking and increasing of ambition.

If aggregated, electric vehicle's fleet can provide flexibility to system operator. Recent literature defines aggregators as electric vehicle charger aggregators which collides with the conventional way of observing electric vehicles, as stationary chargers with connected loads/vehicles. This paper observes them as mobile batteries, not chargers. Therefore, new concept of electric vehicle battery aggregator has been defined which exploits their mobility. Battery aggregator has more information about vehicle's behavior and can maximize their flexibility provision regardless when and where they charge. New concept brings benefits to all system participants from electric vehicle owners, aggregators, and system operators to society altogether.

ENERGIES			English	Article						low carbon technologies; low carbon transition; decarbonisation; zero carbon; air pollution; diesel ban; electric vehicles; transport policy; transport planning; London	LOW-EMISSION ZONE; AIR-QUALITY; ELECTRIC VEHICLES; TRANSPORT; ATTITUDES; BARRIERS; CARS; BAN; INNOVATION; SCENARIO	Air pollution contributes to 9400 deaths annually in London and diesel vehicles are considered a major source of lethal air pollutants. Consequently, the UK government announced its intention to ban diesel vehicles by 2040 to achieve a sustainable zero-carbon road transport system. Since no empirical studies have used a bottom-up approach to seek Londoners' views, it is therefore worth investigating the public opinion regarding this forthcoming ban. This paper aims to fill this research gap by taking London as a case study. A survey was designed, and fieldwork was conducted to distribute questionnaires to Londoners. Completed questionnaires were analysed using both quantitative and qualitative methods. The findings revealed that the majority of Londoners would be in favour of the ban if they were sufficiently exposed to the appropriate sources of information and were favourably disposed towards environmental protection measures. The results also showed that Londoners were more likely to switch to electric vehicles (EVs) if they were offered generous incentives and encouraged to use scrappage schemes. The present study makes a strong case for enforcing the ban well before 2040. The significance of this research is to provide clearer signals regarding the future of diesel vehicles, which in turn will strengthen the EV policy and uptake.

Household energy vulnerability and the transition to hydrogen in Australia	ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Natural gas; Hydrogen; Energy transition; Vulnerability; Residential; Consumer; Australia	SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEMS; LOW-INCOME OLDER; LIVED EXPERIENCE; ELECTRICITY; JUSTICE; GENERATION; POVERTY; IMPACTS; PRICES; EQUITY	Energy supply side policy in Australia currently advocates a role for hydrogen as a key part of decarbonising gas, including in the residential sector. However, there has been little focus to date on demand side issues and, in particular, the impact of a transition to hydrogen on vulnerable consumers. Vulnerability in the energy sector is the result of a complex interplay of structural and individual factors, and there is growing cross-sectoral concern that without careful consideration, existing vulnerabilities may be exacerbated in the low-carbon energy transition. While energy vulnerability in the decarbonisation of electricity has received attention, limited research exists on the potential impacts of a transition to hydrogen fuel in the domestic sector for consumers. At a national level there are plans, and pilot projects underway, to inject hydrogen into domestic natural gas supplies, beginning with low percentage blends of hydrogen and moving towards 100% hydrogen ultimately produced by renewable energy. This project investigated what is currently known, and what still needs to be known, about the potential impacts of decarbonising Australia's residential gas with hydrogen on energy vulnerability, drawing on existing literature and key stakeholder views from the energy industry, government and social advocacy groups. The findings from this preliminary study reveal critical knowledge gaps in the field which must be addressed if an equitable transition to low-carbon gaseous fuels in Australia's residential sector is to be achieved. Five research options are made to help fill these knowledge gaps.

J	Eyre, N				Eyre, Nick			Carbon reduction in the real world: how the UK will surpass its Kyoto obligations	CLIMATE POLICY			English	Article						UK climate policy; UK energy policy; Energy efficiency; Renewable energy		Carbon dioxide emissions from UK energy use have fallen by more than 20% over the last 30 years, and carbon intensity-carbon emissions per unit of GDP-has halved. These reductions have been achieved by a combination of decarbonisation of the energy system and substantial improvements in energy efficiency. Use of natural gas in power generation has been a big factor in recent years, but energy efficiency improvements in households and particularly industry have been more important over a longer period. Government policies designed primarily to address climate change have not been important contributors, until recently. Future reductions in emissions will require more proactive policies. However, they are possible without any economic difficulties, notably by adopting cost-effective energy efficiency measures, using new renewable energy sources and reducing dependence on private cars. These policies will improve economic efficiency. The new UK Climate Change Programme includes policies that combine regulation, investment, fiscal measures and other economic instruments. By working with the grain of other social, environmental and economic policies, they can achieve far more than a carbon tax alone, set at any politically acceptable level. Modelling the costs of emission reductions using a carbon tax as the only instrument would not only massively over-estimate costs, it would bear little resemblance to real world politics. The paper demonstrates that a more diverse set of policy instruments is likely to be an effective and politically acceptable approach in a mature industrial economy. It is concluded that the UK's Kyoto target of a 12.5% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is not challenging. The UK Government's target of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 20% between 1990 and 2010 is also achievable. By 2010 per capita emissions from the UK will be well below 2.5 tC per year. Claims that some countries, notably the USA, could not reduce per capita emissions below 6 tC per year seem inconsistent with this experience.

J	Crawley, J; Johnson, C; Calver, P; Fell, M				Crawley, Jenny; Johnson, Charlotte; Calver, Philippa; Fell, Michael			Demand response beyond the numbers: A critical reappraisal of flexibility in two United Kingdom field trials	ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Demand response; Direct load control; Critical peak rebate; Flexibility capital	SOURCE HEAT-PUMPS; SIDE RESPONSE; PERFORMANCE	Domestic demand response - specifically, changing household electricity usage patterns in response to signals - is an increasingly important part of electricity system decarbonisation. Many forms of demand response exist and there is a live question of the most appropriate and fair way to design it, especially regarding which types of household can participate and how. Using secondary qualitative analysis of published trial documentation, this paper compares two UK based trials in low income households whose headline results - kW peak reduction - differed by two orders of magnitude. Using a framework based on flexibility capital, the contextual factors underlying these different peak reductions are examined, and these headline results are balanced against other outcomes of the trials. The analysis examines the technical and social sources of flexibility capital in each trial, who controlled this capital, and for whom it delivered value. This highlights questions to consider when designing demand response, such as to what extent participants should be expected to understand and actively participate, who should control their energy use and the spread of responsibility and liability across facilitating parties. We argue that critical reappraisals of existing evidence are necessary as the terms for consumer participation in the future energy system are being established. There exist important aspects and consequences of demand response that are overlooked if schemes focus solely on how many Watts can be shifted. This is crucial as governments, the private sector and a growing number of other parties test and implement different demand response strategies.

J	Stamford, L; Greening, B; Azapagic, A				Stamford, Laurence; Greening, Benjamin; Azapagic, Adisa			Life cycle environmental and economic sustainability of Stirling engine micro-CHP systems	ENERGY TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						combined heat and power; global warming potential; life cycle assessment; life cycle costing; technoeconomic analysis	INTEGRATING SOLAR PV; COGENERATION SYSTEMS; BATTERY STORAGE; CO2 EMISSIONS; COMBINED HEAT; ENERGY; IMPACTS; POWER	Micro-combined heat and power (micro-CHP) systems have gained prominence in Europe and elsewhere, often attracting government incentives. Of the various micro-CHP technologies, Stirling engine (SE) systems are often preferred over internal combustion engines, but their economic and environmental sustainability is unclear. This study uses life cycle assessment and life cycle costing to analyze SE micro-CHP units, comparing the results to conventional natural gas boilers and grid electricity. Assuming highly-efficient operation (77% thermal; 13% electrical efficiency), the SE system is preferable to conventional electricity and heat both economically and environmentally (for nine of 11 impacts). However, at more realistic efficiencies (71% thermal; 6% electrical), the SE system is uncompetitive, being worse for seven environmental impacts, including global warming, and incurring 9% higher costs, despite subsidy. The choice of electricity, heat or combined output as a functional unit greatly affects the results. At low efficiencies, per unit of electricity, the SE system has on average 44% worse environmental performance than grid electricity. However, per unit of heat it is, on average, 30% better environmentally than the gas boiler, but the global warming potential (GWP) is 19% worse. For combined energy output, the SE system has on average 3% lower impacts than conventional alternatives, but the GWP is 16% higher. Future improvements to the environmental impacts of the electricity grid mix, including its decarbonization, would further reduce any relative benefits of the SE system, calling into question the suitability of subsidy.

The 2050 Swiss energy strategy envisages 30-75% introduction of electric cars by 2050, which is designed to support the goal of decarbonising the energy sector. While the Swiss government has decided to phase out nuclear electricity, deployment of electric cars can affect electricity supply and emission trajectories. Therefore, potential interactions between the electricity and transport sectors must be considered in assessing the future role of electric mobility. We analyse a set of scenarios using the Swiss TIMES energy system model with high temporal resolution. We generate insights into cross-sectoral trade-offs between electricity supply and electrification/decarbonisa tion of car fleets. E-mobility supports decarbonisation of car fleet even if electricity is supplied from large gas power plants or relatively low cost sources of imported electricity. However, domestic renewable based electricity generation is expected to be too limited to support e-mobility. Stringent abatement targets without centralised gas power plants render e-mobility less attractive, with natural gas hybrids becoming cost effective. Thus the cost effectiveness of electric mobility depends on policy decisions in the electricity sector. The substitution of fossil fuels with electricity in transport has the potential to reduce revenues from fuel taxation. Therefore it is necessary to ensure consistency between electricity sector and transport energy policies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Racial inequity in household energy efficiency and carbon emissions in the United States: An emissions paradox	ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Energy justice; Race; Climate change; Carbon footprint; Household energy use; Energy efficiency	JUSTICE; CONSUMPTION; DISPARITIES	Residential energy use represents roughly 17% of annual greenhouse gas emissions in the United States (U.S.). Studies show that legacy housing policies and financial lending practices have negatively impacted housing quality and home ownership in non-Caucasian and immigrant communities. Both factors are key determinants of household energy use. But to date there has been no national scale analysis of how race and ethnicity affect household energy use and related carbon emissions. In this paper, we estimate energy use and emissions of 60 million household to clarify how energy efficiency and carbon emissions vary by race, ethnicity, and home ownership. We find that per capita emissions are higher in Caucasian neighborhoods than in African-American neighborhoods, even though the former live in more energy-efficient homes (low energy use intensity). This emissions paradox is explained by differences in building age, rates of home ownership, and floor area in these communities. In African-American neighborhoods, homes are older, home ownership is lower (reducing the likelihood of energy retrofits), and there is less floor area per person compared to Caucasian neighborhoods. Statistical models suggest that historical housing policies, particularly "redlining", partially explain these differences. We suggest three policies to address this emissions paradox: Government financing of home retrofits, particularly in rental units; Increased access to photovoltaics in disadvantaged communities; and Disincentivizes for high energy consumption and emissions. Addressing this emissions paradox provides an opportunity for an equitable decarbonization of the U.S. housing sector.

J	Cetkovic, S; Buzogany, A				Cetkovic, Stefan; Buzogany, Aron			The Political Economy of EU Climate and Energy Policies in Central and Eastern Europe Revisited: Shifting Coalitions and Prospects for Clean Energy Transitions	POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE			English	Article						Central and Eastern Europe; Council of Ministers; domestic interests; energy transition; Energy Union; EU climate policy; EU energy; illiberalism; Visegrad states	UNION COUNCIL; ENLARGEMENT; PREFERENCES; CAPITALISM; VARIETIES; EMERGENCE; FEEDBACK; IMPACT; POWER	The countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) have commonly been regarded as climate and energy policy laggards blocking more ambitious EU decarbonization targets. Although recent literature has increasingly acknowledged the differences in national positions on energy and climate issues among these states, there has been little comprehensive evidence about their positioning on EU climate and energy policies and the domestic interests which shape government preferences. The article addresses this gap by tracing the voting behavior of six CEE countries (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania) on EU energy-related legislation in the Council of Ministers between 2007-2018. The article shows that the contestation of energy policies, particularly of climate-related legislation, in the Council of Ministers has increased over time and that these six CEE countries have indeed most often objected to the adoption of EU legislation. The CEE states do not, however, have a common regional positioning on all EU energy policies. Voting coalitions among the six CEE countries differ substantially across energy policy areas. The lack of a common regional position and changing national preferences have enabled the adoption of a relatively ambitious EU Energy and Climate Package for 2030. The differences in national voting patterns are explained by the evolving interests and the ability of key domestic political and economic actors to adapt to and explore benefits from the ever-expanding EU energy and climate policies.

J	Hu, M; Esram, NW				Hu, Ming; Esram, Nora Wang			The Status of Embodied Carbon in Building Practice and Research in the United States: A Systematic Investigation	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						embodied carbon; knowledge gap; method; database; tools		The building construction industry accounts for 5% of global energy use and 10% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A primary source of these emissions is the manufacture of building construction materials such as steel, cement, and glass. As aggressive building energy codes push new construction towards net-zero-energy and net-zero-carbon operations, corresponding efforts to reduce embodied energy and carbon from building construction materials must be pursued to achieve the decarbonization goals of the building sector. In the past few decades, progressive building energy codes as well as the underlying research on reducing the operational energy and its related greenhouse gas emissions have stimulated changes of practice in building design and operation. In contrast, strategies to reduce embodied carbon in the substitute remaining life-cycle stages of a building are less defined and studied. The selection of building materials and systems is largely unregulated, as long as minimum health, safety, and performance standards are met. In addition, it is unclear whether we have adequate knowledge infrastructure to incorporate embodied carbon into national model codes. This study provides a comprehensive review of the current state of knowledge of existing methods, databases, and tools on embodied carbon studies, and identifies the knowledge gaps. It provides a basis for the governments, academia, industry, and other institutes to collaboratively fill in these gaps and develop standards and codes to decarbonize buildings and their interface with other sectors.

J	Batruch, C				Batruch, Christine			Facing the energy transition: options for countries and companies to move forward	JOURNAL OF WORLD ENERGY LAW & BUSINESS			English	Article								It has taken decades for the international community to recognize that climate change is a global issue that needs to be addressed by concerted international action. Many climate activists focus on the fossil fuel industry as the main culprit for greenhouse gas emissions and advocate for a cessation of investments in this sector. This is despite the fact that it is the use of oil and gas in housing, transportation and industry, not its production that represents over 90 per cent of its global emissions.' This misrepresents the global challenge that is one facing society's energy use at large. During this period of energy transition, and for decades to come, oil and gas will continue to constitute a major component of the world's growing energy demand. All energy consumers, whether governments, industries and the general public therefore need to reduce their energy consumption, while producing countries and companies need to reduce their carbon footprint, as well as increase investments in renewable energy. In this context, Norway serves as a valuable case study of what it takes to become a carbon efficient energy producer. The example of Lundin Energy AB, one of Europe's leading independent oil and gas producers, operating exclusively offshore Norway, shows how the Norwegian regulatory environment, coupled with the Company's sustainability commitments and its Decarbonization Strategy, have resulted in the production of one of the lowest carbon intensity barrels in the world.

The aggregated individual intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) are not yet sufficient to be consistent with the long-term goals of the agreement of 'holding the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 degrees C' and 'pursuing efforts' towards 1.5 degrees C. However, the Paris Agreement gives hope that this inconsistency can be resolved. We find that many of the contributions are conservative and in some cases may be overachieved. We also find that the preparation of the INDCs has advanced national climate policy-making, notably in developing countries. Moreover, provisions in the Paris Agreement require countries to regularly review, update and strengthen these actions. In addition, the significant number of non-state actions launched in recent years is not yet adequately captured in the INDCs. Finally, we discuss decarbonization, which has happened faster in some sectors than expected, giving hope that such a transition can also be accomplished in other sectors. Taken together, there is reason to be optimistic that eventually national action to reduce emissions will be more consistent with the agreed global temperature limits. Policy relevance The next step for the global response to climate change is not only implementation, but also strengthening, of the Paris Agreement. To this end, national governments must formulate and implement policies to meet their INDC pledges, and at the same time consider how to raise their level of ambition. For many developing countries, implementation and tougher targets will require financial, technological and other forms of support. The findings of this article are highly relevant for both national governments and support organizations in helping them to set their implementation priorities. Its findings also put existing INDCs in the context of the Paris Agreement's global goals, indicating the extent to which current national commitments need to be strengthened, and possible ways in which this could be done.

Sustainability modelling and green energy optimisation in microgrid powered distributed FogMicroDataCenters in rural area	WIRELESS NETWORKS			English	Article						MicroGrid optimal sizing; Green Data Centers; Fog computing; Software Defined Networking (SDN)	SERVICE; GENERATION; NETWORKING; ALGORITHM; SOLAR	Government now-a-days are looking forward to achieve "Energy for All" standards. Countries are committing themselves to reduce carbon emissions. Recently, every IT industry giants, who typically own and operate huge Data Centers (DC) are looking forward to achieve "100% usage of green energy to power their datacenters, contribute to the utility grid in equivalence to their electrical power consumptions". Electrification and gradual decarbonisation still continue as significant, global concern. Hence it is pretty clear that need for MicroGrid (MG) based facilities is actually a mandatory. But intermittent-characteristic (unreliability/unavailability) of Renewable-Energy (RE) generating sources (like Solar Panels, Wind Turbines) regularly hinder both the stake holders-Government and IT industry from accomplishing such social and economic initiatives. Hence SmartMicroGrid (SMG) connected with utility grid are envisioned to support powering industries inorder to avoid future power outages. Interconnected industry4.0 factories where, actually the smart-management interms of two-way power supply and two-way communication network is foreseen. They are highly dependent on modern, integrated, Information and Communication technologies (IoT sensors, Fog and Cloud computing etc.). In this paper we have focussed on two objectives. Firstly our objective is to identify, optimum renewable-generation-capacities inorder to minimise investment cost of a microgrid. Secondly our objective is to maximize usage of more clean energy for applications running on FogMicroDataCenter (fogMDC), powered by microgrids and controlled by Sofware Defined Networking (SDN). We have used realistic meteorological data of Tamil nadu, India for our proposed work. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work proposed for two different scenarios, performance modelling and economic modelling aiding MG powered FogMDCs. Proposed economic modelling work is related to finding, the optimum sizing of distributed energy resources and financial cost. Proposed performance modelling is about, the clean energy usages in micro grid powered fogMDC for operations, supported by SDN for efficient distributed Virtual Machine (VM) based resource utilization to guarantee QoS in time sensitive IoT applications.

It is crucial that countries develop effective policies and support mechanisms to grow sustainable bioenergy sectors. This paper analyses the success of bioenergy policies within each country and evaluates the importance of wider independent variables that collectively characterise the background to energy sector, economic and environmental dynamics. Statistical correlation and regression analyses are applied to identify if the policy landscape has had an identifiable impact on actual bioenergy development. Furthermore, the outputs from a stakeholder workshop and expert interviews are analysed to identify drivers and barriers to bioenergy. The result is a comprehensive analysis of the successes and challenges in bioenergy development, and possible lessons that can be drawn for future promotion of the sector. The research finds that the UK and Nordic countries have had different yet equally successful approaches to promoting bio-power and bio-heat respectively. However, the influence of wider factors within different countries is found to have a potentially greater collective impact on bioenergy than any single policy mechanism. Thus there is credence in learning lessons from what does and does not work in different countries, but countries also need to develop their own brands of policy interventions that suit their country's unique challenges.

Venkata			A critical view on the environmental sustainability of biorefinery systems	CURRENT OPINION IN GREEN AND SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY			English	Article								Fossil resource depletion and associated global warming are the key drivers that are advocating a shift from fossil-based to a biobased economy. Biorefinery offers a sustainable and green option through decarbonization pathways to produce market-able biobased products analogous to the petro-based refinery and therefore supports bioeconomy. Both environmental and economical sustainability will be key in adopting the biorefinery systems in the context of the Industrial Revolution 4.0. Envi-ronmental impact assessment of biorefinery is a critical inter-vention toward understanding its sustainability in a wider context. Life cycle assessment tools will help in a major way in comprehensively assessing the impact with a designed methodological protocol which eventually provides environ-mental impact metrics, as well as hotspots. However, the application of life cycle assessment to biorefinery systems still needs to be optimized systematically with guidelines for ac-curate assessment with a standard protocol.

J	Marquardt, J				Marquardt, Jens			Fridays for Future's Disruptive Potential: An Inconvenient Youth Between Moderate and Radical Ideas	FRONTIERS IN COMMUNICATION			English	Article						climate change; global governance; social movement; youth; Fridays for Future; sociotechnical imaginaries; Germany	CLIMATE-CHANGE; COPENHAGEN; GOVERNANCE; RIGHTS	In December 2015, political leaders celebrated the Paris Agreement as a milestone in the global fight against climate change. Three years later, Greta Thunberg's school strike outside the Swedish parliament inspired thousands of students around the world to protest against their political leaders' inability to adequately respond to climate change. Envisioning livable climate futures for generations to come, the emerging "Fridays for Future" (FFF) movement urges governments to take more radical action on climate change. While FFF has sparked discussions about climate change around the world, the movement's effects on broader societal change remain unclear. We, therefore, explore how FFF has triggered debates beyond the necessity to tackle climate change and offer a framework to reflect upon the broader socio-political implications of the school strikes. We illustrate the contestation between different ideas of social life and political order encapsulated within and attached to FFF by analyzing the movement's self-understanding and the media discourse around these protests in Germany. Although the German government portrays the country as a pioneer in moving an industry-based economy toward decarbonization, the school strikes have quickly emerged and stabilized. We explore if and how the FFF protestors express not only the need for climate action but also call for deeper societal transformation. To do so, our study draws upon a discourse analysis based on news articles, official documents, and speeches, complemented by qualitative interviews with youth representatives and experts involved in the movement to identify competing imaginaries and themes of contestation. We study the tensions between competing student-led visions of the future through the lens of sociotechnical imaginaries, which allows us to illuminate and juxtapose moderate and radical approaches. In conclusion, current school protests are not only about climate action but reflect more fundamental political struggles about competing visions of a future society in times of climate change. Yet, the protestors' strong focus on science-driven politics risks to overshadow these broader societal debates, potentially stabilizing the techno-centric, apolitical and market-driven rationale behind climate action.

A Spatial Correlation Network Analysis in China	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						tourism economic growth; carbon emission; decoupling theory; spatial correlation network; influencing factor; social network analysis	ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; ECO-EFFICIENCY; CO2 EMISSIONS; SECTOR; FOOTPRINT; PATTERNS; OUTPUT	This research aims to analyze the spatial correlation network of the decoupling between tourism growth and carbon emissions in China's 31 provinces to promote the overall decoupling through regional cooperation. This study scientifically measures the decoupling index from 2009 to 2019 based on a "bottom-up" method and the Tapio decoupling model. It analyzes the spatial correlation network of the decoupling and its driving factors by using social network analysis. The conclusions show that the decoupling between China's tourism economic growth and carbon emissions was dominated by an expansive connection, which indicates a nonideal decoupling state. Among the regions, decoupling was stronger in the eastern provinces and weaker in the middle and western districts. The spatial correlation outside the plates was more significant, while the internal correlation was weaker. Beijing and Shanghai were in the center of the network, and the eastern developed provinces were in the subcentral place, both of which had more muscular control over the network. In contrast, the middle and western regions were on edge positions, playing passive roles in the network. In addition, the economic development level was the most vital driving force behind the spatial correlation, followed by spatial adjacency and government policy. In contrast, the industrial structure and technological level were negative influencing factors. These research findings indicate potential interprovincial cooperation in terms of tourism decarbonization, which provide a profound reference for the whole sustainable development of China's tourism industry.

This is a global problem in which the growth of road transport constitutes a major factor. Looking to the future, electric vehicles (EVs) are considered to be the choice technology for reducing road transport greenhouse gas emissions, but their impact on air quality needs to be considered. Taking the UK as a case study, this paper begins by understanding the trajectory of a future scenario without the introduction of EVs, reflecting on the latest emission control improvements in internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). This is then compared to a 2050 scenario in which the introduction of EVs, based on the UK government's Transport Decarbonisation Plan, is reviewed. This plan includes a ban on the sale of ICEV cars and LGVs, beginning in 2030, with the subsequent electrification of heavier vehicles. By 2030, population exposure to NOx was found to be significantly reduced in the ICEV scenario, with a marginal further reduction found for the EV scenario. The EV scenario further reduced NOx exposure by 2050, with most of the benefits being realized before 2040. For the ICEV and EV scenario, PM2.5 emissions were largely unchanged due to the primary contribution of non-exhaust emissions, suggesting that EVs are likely to yield relatively smaller changes in exposure to PM2.5 than for NOx.

This paper presents a modeling framework to analyze how the different policy measures of the EMR will shape the future UK electricity generation mix until 2050. We set up a two-sector model where players can invest in various types of generation technologies including renewables, nuclear, and Carbon Capture, Transport, and Storage (CCTS). For a detailed representation of CCTS we also include industry players (iron/steel as well as cement), CO2 transport, and CO2 storage including the option for CO2-enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR). The players maximize their expected profits based on variable, fix and investment costs, as well as the price of electricity, CO2 abatement, and other incentives, subject to technical and environmental constraints. Demand is inelastic and represented via a selection of representative hours. The model framework allows for regional disaggregation and features simplified electricity and CO2 pipeline networks. The model uses a mass balance as market clearing for electricity and CO2. The equilibrium solution is subject to constraints on CO2 emissions. In this paper we present the model formulation and some preliminary results to illustrate the mechanics of the model. The tentative scenario indicates a diversified technology mix for 2050. The CCTS development is purely triggered by CO2-EOR; the EMR does not incentives any additional CCTS investments.

Energy consumption goals for buildings are pursued through high thermal performance building components (HTPBC). Paradoxically, building regulations have no requirements regarding the embodied energy of buildings and components. To meet the requirements set by governments, HTPBCs in most cases require an increasing embodied energy (from insulation), assumed to be paid back during the service-life of HTPBCs. Accounting for decarbonization of the future energy supply, the expected payback might not be feasible in terms of total environmental footprint, since the future energy supplies are expected to be greener than the building's embodied energy. Using roof windows as a case study, we assess if strict demands for building's energy consumption, will lead to more sustainable buildings if all temporal variations in terms of global warming impacts across the service-life are taken into account. A comparison of double and tripple glazed windows reveals that the expected net energy savings obtained during the use phase are compromised by relatively higher impacts induced in the production stage. The case study indicates requirements of building's energy performance might compromise the overall sustainability of building component solutions, as the additional embodied energy required to produce triple glazed windows most likely will not be compensated for by saved operational energy, when taking into account the forecasted decarbonatization of the building energy future supply.

Decentralisation and inclusivity in the energy sector: Preconditions, impacts and avenues for further research	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS			English	Article						Energy transition; Decentralisation; Inclusivity; Institutional analysis; Energy policy; Energy democracy	RENEWABLE ENERGY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COMMUNITY ENERGY; POLITICAL-POWER; TRANSITIONS; POLICY; GERMANY; PROMOTION; EUROPE	This editorial for the Special Issue entitled 'Energy Decentralisation - Institutional Perspectives' in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews contrasts and compares thirteen research and review articles submitted over the last year, each with a specific regional or thematic focus. The contributions examine decentralisation, its impacts and/or institutional preconditions in the United States, Sweden, UK, Denmark, South Africa, Germany, France, Japan, the Netherlands, Australia, and include three international thematic reviews. Embedding the findings from this work in the wider literature on decentralisation and inclusivity, we identify key findings and avenues for further research. Our review begins with an overview of how energy decentralisation is conceptualised in research and policy, identifying the logics used by proponents and opponents across the literature. We review the ways in which structural institutional settings have influenced the prevalence of narratives furthered by stakeholders with different interests and worldviews, resulting in radically different policy decisions, support frameworks and incentive structures at regional or national scales. Building on these findings, our concluding discussion reflects on the factors that influence social consensus on, and effective implementation of, ambitious and inclusive energy policy. The focus of this Special Issue has become yet more relevant as governments around the world are forced to marry multiple crises in fiscal spending decisions; where significant economic support packages need to buffer the socio-economic impacts of COVID19 in the short to medium term, and simultaneously facilitate investment in infrastructure, technology and competencies that will enable the decarbonisation of the economy.

J	Antepara, I				Antepara, Inigo			Under-Consumption Penalties in the Low Carbon Market: Reflections From a Spanish Social Housing Provider	FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE CITIES			English	Article						low carbon; social housing; energy poverty; under-consumption; positive energy districts	FUEL POVERTY; PERFORMANCE; GAP	This proposal focuses on the analysis of three case studies of a Spanish social landlord-Basque Alokabide, submitted to the Carbon Fund for a Sustainable Economy. The calculation of CO2 emissions follows themethodology recommended by the Spanish government. The economic viability of the cases analyzed is calculated, first without taking into account the money obtained from the carbon market, and then taking advantage of the sale of the emissions. The interest value of this work is the examination of how low incomes tend to be overrepresented in social housing, resulting in lower energy consumption and colder dwellings. Since low income tenants under-consume energy, before renovation CO2 emissions are lower, and therefore Alokabide is taking less advantage of the carbon market. Additionally, photovoltaic systems, while easier to implement even at district level, are not eligible in the Spanish program, and this is also disadvantageous. In the policy recommendations, the ex-ante accounting of emissions should be justified on the basis of theoretical energy consumption with average consumers, rather than verifying ex-post actual emissions by low income household that under consume: energy efficiency measures lead to improved thermal comfort, and this added benefit should be taken into account in the economic viability. Toward the goal of reducing emissions after retrofitting, decarbonization is more feasible than the reduction of the energy consumption through the substitution of fossil fuels by renewables to satisfy primary energy needs.

To build coalitions of support, scholars and policy makers propose compensating individuals who will bear decarbonization's costs. What are the determinants of public opinion regarding climate compensation and investment? We theorize that climate policy vulnerability and climate change vulnerability induce support for distinct types of climate policy. Fielding original surveys in the United States and India, we show that people who reside in coal-producing regions prefer compensation for lost jobs. The general public privileges diffuse redistribution mechanisms and investments, discounting compensation to targeted groups. Those who are both physically and economically vulnerable have cross-cutting preferences. Nevertheless, there is considerable support across our samples for policies that compensate different coalitions of climate-vulnerable citizens, in line with theories of "just energy" transition and embedded liberalism. We trace the distinctive compensatory preferences of fossil fuel communities to a logic of shared community identities.

J	Zimmermann, M; Pye, S				Zimmermann, Michel; Pye, Steve			Inequality in energy and climate policies: Assessing distributional impact consideration in UK policy appraisal	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Distributional impacts; Policy appraisal; Impact assessments; Energy transition; Climate policy	PUBLIC-POLICY; KNOWLEDGE; POLITICS; GOVERNMENT; TAXATION; JUSTICE	The decarbonisation of the UK economy requires a myriad of policies that inherently produce winners and loser across society. This study investigates how such distributional impacts are considered in the appraisal process for UK energy and climate policies. Using a scorecard developed to capture the guidance on policy appraisal and distributional analysis, 79 impact assessments were evaluated. The majority of these impact assessments either did not or only partially considered the impacts of policies on vulnerable groups in society, with only eight assessments containing more detailed distributional analysis. Moreover, a bias seems to exist as to which areas of energy and climate policy provide well-founded analysis and which do not. With further insights gained from interviews with relevant actors, this research concludes that political motivation, analytical difficulties and a lack of awareness of the prevalence and importance of distributional impacts are at the root of this insufficient consideration. Possible alterations to the current IA framework are presented, which aim to more firmly embed the distributional impact assessment in the appraisal process.

Microwave-accelerated regeneration of a non-aqueous slurry for energy-efficient carbon sequestration	MATERIALS TODAY SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Carbon capture; CO2; Sorbent; Water Saving; Non-equilibrium effects	CO2 CAPTURE TECHNOLOGY; OXIDATIVE-DEGRADATION; AMINE SORBENTS; ABSORPTION; KINETICS; WATER; ALKANOLAMINES; PERFORMANCE; SILICA	We have developed a slurry of basic immobilized amine sorbent (BIAS) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) oil for a CO2 adsorption/desorption process aided by the Microwave-Accelerated Regeneration of a Slurry (MARS). Selective microwave heating of CO2-adsorbed BIAS can accelerate the CO2 desorption flux by 10 times and consume much less energy for sorbent regeneration, compared to thermal heating. Furthermore, the microwave regeneration temperatures of the slurry can be lowered to 65-85 degrees C. These results indicate that the microwave-accelerated swing method is highly energy-efficient, which can substantially decrease the energy penalty for CO2 capture and downscale the capture process, especially the regeneration equipment. The microwave-assisted non-aqueous capture technology without water and steam use can decrease the cooling duty by 18-48%, compared to the aqueous amine-based capture technology and promote decarbonization in a more sustainable manner.

By managing their own self-generation, customers are able to place natural selection pressure on utilities to evolve. The devised techno-economic simulation model projects residential PV and battery investment decisions over 20 years in Perth, Australia to quantify the potential market impacts from policy and customer investment conditions. Using real-world demand and insolation profiles from 261 households, this research evaluates how cumulative customer PV and battery investments changes the network and market operating conditions, while under the influence of various feed-in tariff values. The results indicate that high feed-in tariff policy costs in the short-term, make it economically challenging to prevent or restrain significant residential PV-battery adoption in the longer-term. Moreover, continuous increases in residential PV-battery system installations eventually lead to annual net-exports substantially exceeding net-imports on the distribution network. This significant shift in network operation provides an opportunity for policymakers to utilise behind-the-meter PV-battery investments and decentralised energy markets to meet wider renewable energy and decarbonisation goals.

Life cycle assessment of the carbon intensity of deep geothermal heat systems: A case study from Scotland	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						CO2 emissions; Energy; Heat network; Low-carbon; Scotland; Geothermal		Deep geothermal energy is widely recognised as a source of low carbon heat. However, to date there have been no specific assessment of the carbon intensity of low-enthalpy deep geothermal; previous studies focussed on geothermal power or higher enthalpy heat. As such, there is no established method for assessing the CO2 emissions from implementing a deep geothermal heating scheme. Here we address these gaps. We perform a life cycle assessment of greenhouse gas emissions relating to a deep geothermal heat system to (i) calculate the carbon intensity of geothermal heat; (ii) identify key factors affecting these values; (iii) consider the carbon abated if geothermal heat substitutes conventional heating; and (iv) present information that future projects can apply to assess the carbon emissions reduction offered by geothermal heat development. Our work is informed by parameters from a feasibility study for a proposed geothermal heat system in Banchory, Scotland. The project planned a 2.5 MWth geothermal plant extracting heat from the Hill of Fare granite via two boreholes, one injection and one production. We find that the majority of the emissions are associated with site construction, and sensitive to site and materials specific factors, for example the depth of the drilled boreholes and type and quantities of steel and cement used to seal them, or soils disturbed for laying pipelines and constructing access roads. During operation the carbon intensity of the electricity grid used to power hydraulic pumps largely determines the carbon intensity of the produced heat. We calculate that the carbon intensity of the heat produced is 9.7-14.0 kg(CO2e) MWh(th) which is 4.9-7.3% of the emissions from heat from natural gas. These values are compatible with Scotland's plans for long term decarbonisation of heat in line with national emission reduction obligations and would likely be compatible with any country's decarbonisation goals.

In general, these generators tend to be connected to utility systems, and they are called distributed generations (DGs) compared with conventional centralized power plants. However, DGs may impact on stabilization of utility systems, which gets utility into trouble. In order to reduce utility's burdens (e.g., investment for facilities reinforcement) and accelerate DG introduction, the advanced operation algorithms under the existing utility systems are urgently needed. This paper presents the advanced voltage regulation method in power systems since the sending voltage of voltage regulators has been played a decisive role restricting maximum installable DG capacity (MaxC_DG). For the proposed voltage regulation method, the difference from existing voltage regulation method is explained and the detailed concept is introduced in this paper. MaxC_DG estimation through case studies based on Korean model network verifies the superiority of the proposed method.				mykim@krs.or.kr; songye@krs.or.kr; kimkh@krs.co.kr			New & Renewable Energy of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning(KETEP); Korea government Ministry of Knowledge Economy [2011T100200064]	New & Renewable Energy of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning(KETEP); Korea government Ministry of Knowledge Economy(Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE), Republic of KoreaKorean Government)	This work was supported by the New & Renewable Energy of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning(KETEP) grant funded by the Korea government Ministry of Knowledge Economy.

On the Theoretical Conceptualisations, Knowledge Structures and Trends of Green New Deals	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Review						green new deal; green growth; bibliometric analysis; environmental policy; decarbonization; COVID-19; sustainability; climate change; negative externalities	CITY	The increasing impacts of climate change, coupled with the Greta Thunberg effect, the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, and varied environmental policy documents, are pointing to the need for urgent and cohesive climate action and mitigation frameworks. One potent solution, gaining global acceptance, is that of the Green New Deal (GND), positioned as a radical rethinking of political and economic structures in view of pushing sustainability at the forefront of national, regional, and global issues. With the model rapidly gaining ground in various geographies, and in different forms in view of contextualization needs, there is a need to better understand its evolution, knowledge structures, and trends. This paper thus sets forth to provide an understanding of the evolution and implementation of GND through a bibliometric analysis and science mapping techniques using VOSviewer and CiteSpace to identify the thematic focus of 1174 articles indexed in the Web of Science since 1995. To understand the thematic evolution of the field over time, we divided the study period into three sub-periods, namely 1995-2014, 2015-2019, and 2020-2021. These sub-periods were determined considering important milestones related to GNDs. Term co-occurrence analyses were then conducted to understand thematic focus and associated trends. Also, co-citation analysis and bibliographic coupling were other methods applied to identify major sources, authors, publications, and countries that have made more contributions to the development of research on GNDs. The findings of this paper can help both researchers and policy makers understand the evolution and trends of GNDs to better formulate GNDs strategies and policies in accordance with varying needs and geographies.

However, the impact of this flexibility on generation investments in the deregulated electricity industry setting remains a largely unexplored area, since previous relevant work neglects the time-coupling nature of demand shifting potentials. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a strategic generation investment planning model expressing the decision making process of a self-interested generation company and accounting for the time-coupling operational characteristics of demand flexibility. This model is formulated as a multi-period bi-level optimization problem, which is solved after converting it to a Mathematical Program with Equilibrium Constraints (MPEC). Case studies with the proposed model demonstrate that demand flexibility reduces the total generation capacity investment, enhances investments in baseload generation and yields significant economic benefits in terms of total system costs and demand payments.

One aspect of this debate concerns the origin of the mineralising fluids. Two important constraints are that the fluids are sulphur and CO2 bearing and that high fluid fluxes are maintained in a spatially localised environment for a relatively short period of time whereas crustal metamorphism/decarbonation operates over many millions of years, the source is not localised and is of regional extent. In this paper we explore the devolatilization of a subducting slab material using coupled petrological thermo-mechanical numerical approach that takes into account dehydration and decarbonation processes. Recent phase equilibria calculations show that decarbonisation of the slab requires much higher temperatures that normally occurs within subduction zones and the devolatilization site in the slab is spatially and temporally localised during slab roll-back or within a hot orogen when the slab material is incorporated into the overriding plate. We also investigate the plausibility of large gold sources in the collisional and back-arc environments.y	[Gorczyk, Weronika; Hobbs, Bruce] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Explorat Targeting, Sch Earth Sci, Nedlands, WA, Australia; [Gonzalez, Christopher M.] Monash Univ, Sch Earth Atmosphere & Environm, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Hobbs, Bruce] Australian Commonwealth Sci & Res Org CSIRO, Canberra, ACT, Australia	University of Western Australia; Monash University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)	Gorczyk, W (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Ctr Explorat Targeting, Sch Earth Sci, Nedlands, WA, Australia.	weronika.gorczyk@uwa.edu.au	Gonzalez, Christopher/C-7150-2018	Gonzalez, Christopher/0000-0002-6464-7087; Gorczyk, Weronika/0000-0002-6704-9808	ARC Centre of Excellence for Core to Crust Fluid Systems [CE110001017]; Australian Government; Government of Western Australia	ARC Centre of Excellence for Core to Crust Fluid Systems(Australian Research Council); Australian Government(Australian GovernmentCGIAR); Government of Western Australia	Taras Gerya is thanked for writing the original I2VIS petrological-thermomechanical code.

From natural gas to electric appliances: Energy use and emissions implications in Australian homes	ENERGY ECONOMICS			English	Article						Energy efficiency; Household behaviour; Distributional impacts; Energy efficiency incentives; Energy consumption; Greenhouse gas emissions	EFFICIENCY INVESTMENTS DELIVER; CONSUMPTION; INCOME; HOUSEHOLDS; HEALTH; COLD	Does variation in household vulnerability influence the effects of switching to new energy-efficient electrical appliances in the home? Using the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Energy Efficiency Improvement Scheme (EEIS) as a case study, this paper examines impacts on energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from replacing natural gas heaters and hot water systems with more energy-efficient electric alternatives. To do so we use quarterly billing data over 2015-2020 for a sample of residential customers of the ACT's largest energy retailer, ActewAGL. Based on fixed effects panel regressions, we find that the electric replacements led to large decreases in residential natural gas consumption and smaller increases in consumption of electricity from the grid in energy content terms. Reductions in natural gas use from switching to electric hot water heaters were particularly large for the more vulnerable households in the scheme. The emissions effects depend on the emissions factor applied for grid electricity and underline the key role that residential electrification can play in decarbonization efforts if electricity is from low-emission sources.

J	Kerr, N; Winskel, M				Kerr, Niall; Winskel, Mark			Have we been here before? Reviewing evidence of energy technology phase-out to inform home heating transitions	ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Review						Energy transition; Heat decarbonisation; Energy technology phase-out; Policy transfer; Policy analogues; Analogous reasoning	SOCIOTECHNICAL TRANSITION; ELECTRICITY TRANSITIONS; REGIME DESTABILIZATION; EFFICIENCY POLICY; UNITED KINGDOMS; GAS; UK; COAL; LESSONS; NUCLEAR	The rapid phase-out of fossil fuel home heating technologies is a formidable policy challenge. In such situations, referring to other cases of technology phase-out that are in some ways similar can offer useful insights, and a reassuring sense that 'we have been here before'. However, analogous reasoning of this kind tends to be partial and anecdotal, so it can mislead rather than inform. Here, we seek to draw more fully on analogous evidence to inform fossil fuel technology phase-out in the home heating sector, with particular reference to the UK. We review international energy technology phase-out experiences across three different sectors, five different technology types and twenty countries. We then assemble the evidence into an interpretive framework in which energy technology phase-out is seen as an outcome of distinctive but interacting techno-economic and socioinstitutional factors and policy design issues, including: relative cost and performance, infrastructure and system context, public engagement and acceptability, incumbent interests and policy mixes and rationales. While some of these feature prominently in policy debates and transitions research, others command less attention. Providing a fuller representation of the factors involved in energy technology phase-out encourages more robust analogous reasoning in policy and research, recognising differences as well as similarities and the extent to which we have been here before.

J	Wahman, M; Surowiak, A				Wahman, Mustapha; Surowiak, Agnieszka			Recycling of Discarded Photovoltaic Modules Using Mechanical and Thermal Methods	INZYNIERIA MINERALNA-JOURNAL OF THE POLISH MINERAL ENGINEERING SOCIETY			English	Article						PV panel; crystalline silicon; recycling; waste; mechanical and thermal processes	SEPARATION; PANELS; END	Photovoltaic installations have experienced very significant growth worldwide since the early 2000s, driven by growing industry and government interest in mitigating climate change, decarbonization, and increasing energy demand. The most prevalent worry with photovoltaic (PV) panels is that their age is limited and they will eventually need to be decommissioned. With the expansion of PV production capacity worldwide, a large amount of PV panel waste will be generated in the future. Since PV panels contain heavy metals such as lead, cadmium and tin, this can have a significant impact on the environment. In addition, they also contain valuable metals (e.g. silver, gallium, indium and germanium) and standard materials (e.g. aluminum, glass) that represent a valuable opportunity when recovered. Developing a sustainable, environmentally friendly recycling process and maximizing the recovery of components from PV panels at the end of their life is expected to solve the PV waste problem. In this work, three alternative methods for recycling silicon-based (mono/polycrystalline) PV panels were investigated based on a combination of mechanical and thermal processes. The three alternative methods are a hammer crusher followed by thermal treatment and square sieve, a shredder crusher followed by thermal treatment and square sieve, and thermal treatment followed by a slotted sieve. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) were performed to evaluate the properties of the obtained products. The results showed that thermal treatment followed by slotted sieve is the most effective method for direct glass recovery for all types of photovoltaic modules studied.

J	Watson, J; Gross, R; Ketsopoulou, I; Winskel, M				Watson, Jim; Gross, Rob; Ketsopoulou, Ioanna; Winskel, Mark			The impact of uncertainties on the UK's medium-term climate change targets	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Uncertainty; Energy policy; Energy strategy		The UK is committed to ambitious medium- and long-term climate change targets, including a commitment to an 80% reduction in emissions from 1990 levels by 2050. Whilst emissions have fallen significantly since 1990, further reductions will be increasingly difficult to achieve. The government has agreed carbon budgets to the late 2020s that are consistent with the long-term 80% target. However, increasing energy prices since the mid-2000s and the 2008 financial crisis have led to cracks in the political consensus in support of these budgets and targets. This paper carries out an assessment of the feasibility of the UK's agreed low carbon pathway over the medium term, with a particular focus on the fourth carbon budget (2023-27). It analyses the uncertainties associated with the specific changes that may be necessary to comply with this carbon budget - including measures to decarbonise electricity, heat and transport. This analysis focuses on 'instrumental' uncertainties associated with specific areas of the energy system (e.g. the decarbonisation of heat in households) and 'systemic' uncertainties that tend to have more pervasive implications for the energy system as a whole (e.g. uncertainties associated with public attitudes). A framework is developed that sets out and analyses the key uncertainties under those two broad categories, in terms of their complexity and their potential impact on the fourth carbon budget. Through the application of this framework the paper also considers strategies to mitigate or manage these uncertainties, and which actors could help develop and implement these strategies.

J	Hamaguchi, Y				Hamaguchi, Yoshihiro			Does the trade of aviation emission permits lead to tourism-led growth and sustainable tourism?	TRANSPORT POLICY			English	Article						Aviation; Emission permits trading; Innovation; Sustainable tourism; Tourism-led growth; Transport	ECONOMIC-GROWTH; POLLUTION PERMITS; DETERMINANTS; EXPENDITURE; IMPACT; POLICY; MODEL	One of the biggest challenges facing the tourism industry is carbon dioxide emissions resulting from the greenhouse gases emitted from aviation indispensable for tourism. Thus, governments have introduced emission permits trading to the aviation industry. However, as this is in the introductory stages, it is unclear how this environmental policy will influence tourism and the environment and whether the policy can contribute to the decarbonisation of the aviation industry. Using an R&D-based growth model considering aviation for tourism, this study investigates how introducing emissions permit trading in aviation influences tourism-led growth and sustainable tourism. Domestic tourism aviation, and not international tourism aviation, was considered because it is estimated that the former short-distance aviation movements emit more greenhouse gases than the latter. The findings demonstrate that fewer permits lead to sustainable tourism despite a generous permit allocation for the manufacturing sector if the goal of tourism-led growth is excluded. This is because the policy improves environmental quality and results in a trade-off between tourism consumption and the economic growth rate. For a generous permit allocation in aviation, the policy leads to decreased tourism consumption and pollutionintensive aviation. These findings imply that emissions permit trading between the aviation and manufacturing sectors inhibits the compatibility of tourism-led growth and sustainable tourism. Finally, this study suggests that sustainable tourism could be realised when manufacturing countries such as Germany and the UK increase aviation permits, while tourism countries such as Spain and Italy decrease aviation permits.

It can reduce the local waste through recycling which will conserve resources, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and build economic resilience in the face of an uncertain future for energy production and waste disposal. The productive use of local waste through recycling conserves resources by reducing landfill space, the whole of life impacts of landfilling, and post-closure maintenance of landfills. Turning waste into a renewable energy source will assist the decarbonisation of the economy by reducing harmful emissions and pollutants. Therefore, this mini-review aims to summarise key factors and present valuable evidence for an efficient AD process. It also presents the pros and cons of different AD process to convert organic waste along with the reactor technologies. Besides, this paper highlights the challenges and the future perspective of the AD process. However, it is highlighted that for an effective and efficient AD process, appropriate temperature, pH, a strong inoculum to substrate ratio, good mixing and small particle sizes are important factors. The selection of suitable AD process and reactor is important because not all types of processes and reactors are not effective for processing organic waste. This study is of great importance for ongoing work on renewable energy generation from waste and provides important knowledge of innovative waste processing. Finally, it is recommended that the government should increase their support towards the AD technology and consider the unutilized significant potential of gaseous biofuel production.	[Uddin, M.

Carbon neutrality is characterized by the decarbonization of operations and maintenance, in addition to zero emissions in electricity and other industry sectors. Taking China's commercial buildings as an example, this study is the first to perform an extensive data analysis for a step-wise carbon neutral roadmap of building operations via the analysis of a dynamic emission scenario. The results reveal that the carbon emissions abatement of commercial building operations from 2001 to 2018 was 1460.85 (+/- 574.61) mega-tons of carbon dioxide (Mt CO2). The carbon emissions of commercial building operations will peak in the year 2039 (+/- 5) at 1364.31 (+/- 258.70) Mt, with emission factors and energy intensity being the main factors influencing the carbon peak. To move toward carbon neutral status, an additional 169.73 Mt CO2 needs to be cut by 2060, and the low emission path toward carbon neutrality will lead to the realization of the carbon peak of commercial buildings in 2024, with total emissions of 921.71 Mt. It is believed that cutting emissions from the operation of buildings in China will require a multi-sectoral synergistic strategy. It is suggested that government, residents, enterprises, and other stakeholders must better appreciate the challenges to achieve a substantial carbon reduction and the need for urgent action in the building sector in order to achieve carbon neutrality.

Transportation networks require the effective use of renewable energy (RE) for EVs, whereas power networks require local consumption of PV energy, mainly at the initiative of local governments. Although many previous studies have addressed these requirements using private EVs as mobile storages, their uncertainty and uncontrollability remain highly problematic. Therefore, our previous studies focused on electric buses because of their high controllability and certainty. These studies involved the development and evaluation of two independent minimization problems-kilowatts (KW) and kilowatt-hours (KWH) of surplus RE-as a charging schedule optimization method using mixed integer linear programming. However, the feasibility of simultaneously minimizing KW and KWH still presented technical problems. This study aims to extend and generalize the method to the simultaneous minimization of KW and KWH of the PV-derived reverse power flow (RPF). With this multiobjective optimization, the KW peak-cut of the RPF improves the hosting capacity and increases the availability of connectable RE resources, whereas the minimization of KWH promotes the local consumption of RE and decarbonization of public transportation. Two simulations using detailed data of actual bus operations and actual power flow data for a real city confirmed the feasibility of simultaneously optimizing KW and KWH and the relationship between these indicators and number of EV chargers. The optimized charging of the 17 electric buses achieved a maximum of 211.4 kW peak-cut and 1318.4 kWh RE-RPF absorption, reducing CO2 emissions by 495.7 kg/day.

However, this body of work to date has been limited in its consideration of how such policy change might be brought about. Translating the lessons from the Coronavirus response to other ongoing strategic challenges such as decarbonisation requires analysis of what the pandemic has revealed about processes of policy formulation and how institutions responsible for policy implementation actually work. This paper explores the extent to which rapid policy change has actually been possible in the transport sector in England and Scotland during the pandemic, and key examples of how such change has been both achieved and blocked. Two rounds of interviews with senior stakeholders from across the transport sector were undertaken in June and November 2020 to inform the analysis. We find that the pandemic has accelerated some policy commitments that were already planned, but at a time of huge stress on the whole of government and its partner delivery organisations, the potential to deliver radical policy adaptation was limited. However, Coronavirus is recognised as being a potentially path-changing disruption to existing trajectories in terms of the adaptations to business practices, industry structures, ways of working and the public finances. Paradoxically, whilst recognising these uncertainties, decision-makers are yet to deviate from pre-pandemic planning assumptions and policy plans and this risks missing the opportunities to steer how those changes unfold.

Biofuels are expected to represent a substantial part of the overall strategy towards diversifying Europe's energy supplies and curbing greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective way. This research deals with the dynamic simulation modeling of a biodiesel market as a part of transportation fuel market and analyses of various policy support instruments on increasing the proportion of biofuel in total transport fuel demand. The study is carried out for Latvia's road transport sector. After it had experienced generous financial support from the government allowing the industry to develop, support was abruptly stopped creating stagnation in both biodiesel supply and demand. This threatened the national transport policy goals. The goal of this research is to find the most effective policy strategies for achieving the national transport policy goals by applying system dynamics modeling to the current market conditions of transport fuels. Specifically, the primary focus of this paper is an attempt to gain insight into the long-term dynamic behavior of the biodiesel market in Latvia. The principal policy tools and mechanisms implemented can be summarized as: i) state subsidies at different levels and stages (i.e. the biodiesel production sector, the agricultural sector, and the end consumer sectors), ii) increasing the excise taxes on fossil fuels, iii) increasing the share of the biodiesel in the transportation fuel blend. The results obtained from model simulations confirm that promoting biofuel acceptance among end-users is the primary key issue. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) represent a promising solution for reducing pollution and GHG emissions; however, their purchase price contributes to curbing their diffusion. In this scenario, the aims of this study are to develop a flexible, simulation-based analysis for EU car fleets in terms of energy consumption and GHG emissions and, based on the simulation results, to propose an innovative system of financial subsidies. This can support governments in encouraging EU customers to prefer sustainable and green options for mobility. Different car segments have been considered; the electrical energy consumptions have been obtained through the development of an ad-hoc simulation model in Simulink (R)-MathWorks environment, while the Well-To-Wheel analysis has been performed to estimate GHG emissions. Based on these assumptions, four different subsidy strategies have been proposed and designed for countries of the EU-27. According to different logics, economic subsidies have been linked to GHG emissions avoided thanks to the use of BEVs. The results obtained show how BEVs' consumption of electricity is low, even for larger vehicles, and this allows BEVs to be considered less impactful than internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEV) with respect to GHG emissions. Furthermore, results are highly variable, depending on the electricity mix of each considered country, and they show how, for the countries that use the most renewable sources, the proposed subsidies even can generate gains from consumers' perspectives.

Consequently, it is crucial to assess whether supply will be able to meet forecast demand within the required timescale. The automotive sector relies on complex global supply chains comprising four tiers. We have developed an integrated timeline from tier 4 (supply of raw materials) through to tier 1, the production of electric vehicles (EVs). Numerous factors, mainly economic, political, social and environmental, influence the duration of tier 4 leading to considerable variation between projects. However, our analysis demonstrates that it commonly takes more than 30 years from initial exploration to EV production. Tier 4, which is often neglected by the automotive industry, may account for 20 years of that period. This suggests that raw material supply is unlikely to match the projected demand from electrification of the automotive sector up to 2030. Reducing the duration of tier 4 will be difficult, although governments and industry can mitigate supply risks in various ways. These include multi-disciplinary international research across the supply chain and the transformation of research findings into policy and best practice. Supply chain convergence, with businesses across the supply chain working to develop long-term plans for secure and sustainable supply, will also be beneficial. In addition, global stakeholders should work together to resolve ESG challenges to supply. All these measures depend on the availability of researchers and industry personnel with appropriate skills and knowledge.

While the country's immediate measures focus on combating the coronavirus spread, it is important to investigate the impacts of the current crisis on India's renewable energy transition and air quality. India's economic slowdown is mainly compounded by the collapse of global oil prices and the erosion of global energy demand. A clean energy transition is a key step in enabling the integration of energy and climate. Millions in India are affected owing to fossil fuel pollution and the increasing climate heating that has led to inconceivable health impacts. This paper attempts to study the impact of COVID-19 on India's climate and renewable energy transitions through machine learning algorithms. India is observing a massive collapse in energy demand during the lockdown as its coal generation is suffering the worst part of the ongoing pandemic. During this current COVID-19 crisis, the renewable energy sector benefits from its competitive cost and the Indian government's must-run status to run generators based on renewable energy sources. In contrast to fossil fuel-based power plants, renewable energy sources are not exposed to the same supply chain disruptions in this current pandemic situation. India has the definite potential to surprise the global community and contribute to cost-effective decarbonization. Moreover, the country has a good chance of building more flexibility into the renewable energy sector to avoid an unstable future.

J	Lockwood, M				Lockwood, Matthew			The political sustainability of climate policy: The case of the UK Climate Change Act	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS			English	Article						Climate change; Climate policy; Public opinion; Politics; UK	PUBLIC-OPINION; GOVERNMENT	This paper assesses the forces working for and against the political sustainability of the UK 2008 Climate Change Act. The adoption of the Act is seen as a landmark commitment to action on climate change, but its implementation has not been studied in any depth. Recent events, including disagreements over the fourth carbon budget and the decarbonisation of the electricity sector, shows that while the Act might appear to lock in a commitment to reducing emissions through legal means, this does not guarantee political lock-in. The assumption, made by some proponents of the Act, that accountability of political leaders to a public concerned about climate change, via Parliament, would provide the main political underpinning to the Act is criticised. An analysis of alternative sources of political durability is presented, drawing on a framework for understanding the sustainability of reform developed by Patashnik. It is argued that the Act has helped create major institutional transformations, although the degree to which new institutions have displaced the power of existing ones is limited. The Act has produced some policy feedback effects, especially in the business community, and some limited investment effects, but both have been insufficient to withstand destabilisation by recent party political conflicts. The Climate Change Act remains at risk. (C) 2013 The Author. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Hess, DJ; Renner, M				Hess, David J.; Renner, Madison			Conservative political parties and energy transitions in Europe: Opposition to climate mitigation policies	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS			English	Review						Conservatives; Political parties; Policy; Energy transitions; Climate change; Renewable energy; Fossil fuels	GOVERNMENT; GERMAN; POWER	This study reviews conservative political party policy positions in six European countries with high greenhouse gas emissions (France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, and the U.K.). Using party platform statements from recent election campaigns, the positions of moderate conservative parties are compared with those of far right political parties to investigate similarities and differences on energy-transition policy. Three areas of policy are considered: climate-change mitigation, fossil-fuel development or sunsetting, and renewable energy and energy efficiency development. In the countries examined, moderate conservative parties generally remain committed to climate-mitigation policy and renewable energy and energy efficiency policy, but there are some roll-backs of support, and there is variation in their support for fossil-fuel development. Far-right parties tend to show evidence of rejection of climate science, opposition to decarbonization in general, support for natural gas hydraulic fracturing technologies, support for continued use of coal, and opposition to some types of policy favorable to renewable energy and energy efficiency. However, some far-right parties, notably in France and Spain, share several important positions with the center-right parties. The study cautions against assuming an automatic linkage between far-right parties and opposition to energy-transition policies and against assuming that far-right parties will oppose all types of energy-transition policies.

Strategic deployment of AD requires careful scoping of interactions with prospective alternative biowaste management, energy generation technologies and land uses to ensure effective delivery of climate neutrality and circularity. There remains a need to assess the greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation efficacy of AD in the context of future alternative (counterfactual) processes associated with differential rates of decarbonisation across energy, waste management and land (including agriculture) sectors. To address this gap, prospective life cycle assessment (LCA) is applied to AD deployment scenarios across three decarbonisation contexts, using the UK as an example. Food waste prevention and diversion to animal feed always achieve more GHG mitigation than AD, even with sustainable intensification of food and feed production. Compared with maize- or grass-biomethane transport fuel, solar electricity generation can avoid 16 times more fossil energy and afforestation can mitigate six times more GHG per hectare of land occupied. Transport biomethane is currently the most effective biogas use for GHG mitigation, but large-scale combustion of biogas for electricity or industrial heat generation is the most effective long-term option as transport is electrified and bioenergy carbon capture & storage (BECCS) is deployed. Prioritising waste prevention and diversion to animal feed (including via insect meal) instead of maximising AD deployment could simultaneously: offset an additional 10-15% of national GHG emissions; meet an additional 2-4% of national energy demand; free enough arable land to provide 20-21% of national recommended protein and kcal intake. However, AD is likely to remain the best option to manage substantial volumes of residual food wastes and manures that will remain available even if ambitious projections on waste prevention and diet change are realised.

However, things have started to change, owing to the increased adoption of data democratisation processes, and the capability offered by emerging technologies for data sharing while respecting privacy, protection, and security, as well as appropriate learning-based modelling capabilities for non-expert end-users. This is particularly evident in the energy sector. In this context, the aim of this paper is to analyse AI and data democratisation, in order to explore the strengths and challenges in terms of data access problems and data sharing, algorithmic bias, AI transparency, privacy and other regulatory constraints for AI-based decisions, as well as novel applications in different domains, giving particular emphasis on the energy sector. A data democratisation framework for intelligent energy management is presented. In doing so, it highlights the need for the democratisation of data and analytics in the energy sector, toward making data available for the right people at the right time, allowing them to make the right decisions, and eventually facilitating the adoption of decentralised, decarbonised, and democratised energy business models.

Efforts have been made by the government particularly in the 12th national 5-year plan to attenuate energy generation from carbon-emitting resources. Solar PV and Wind energy have been the focus of attention in the past ten years. Development of CSP in China is still at its infancy phase. The paper evaluates the potential of CSP development by assessing solar, water, land, climatic conditions and manmade resources as key criteria for suitable site selection of CSP plants in China. It assesses the current energy-mix of China and highlights the paradox of fossil fuel resources prevailing the energy portfolio. It presents the need for CSP in the current scenario to overcome the ever-growing energy demand, help decarbonization and environmental degradation. An analysis comprising of evaluation of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats based on current trends, government policies, ground realities, statistical literature and relevant regulations is performed to review the CSP development in China. The results argue even though current development of CSP in China is slow and unnecessarily delayed and a few CSP plants are either altered significantly or even cancelled in past, particularly with its first phase of opening 20 CSP plants, the technology can be boosted if proper and timely measures are instigated by the stakeholders particularly the legislators. The sitting factors for CSP technologies concerning particular locations suggested in the current research can be valuable in the decision-making process for site and CSP technology selection. Recent history suggests that, even though the price of CSP plants in China under construction is still 40% lesser than plants being anywhere else, there was no significant development as planned in 2019, 2020 has been a little better with several projects in the pipeline come into operation. The analysis presented can help sort out strengths and overcome threats and weakness in the deployment of CSP technology in China. The prevailing key issues in CSP growth along with precautionary needed measures for threats are also summarized at the end.

J	Hamilton, I; Summerfield, A; Oreszczyn, T; Ruyssevelt, P				Hamilton, Ian; Summerfield, Alex; Oreszczyn, Tadj; Ruyssevelt, Paul			Using epidemiological methods in energy and buildings research to achieve carbon emission targets	ENERGY AND BUILDINGS			English	Article						Energy demand; Building stock; Epidemiology; Methods; Data	PERFORMANCE; CONSUMPTION; EFFICIENCY; VS.	Energy demand reduction from buildings is widely recognised as a key component of greenhouse gas abatement strategies. As governments shift towards large-scale sectoral interventions, a far more robust research and evidence base is needed to support the development, implementation, and on-going evaluation of energy demand policy. The shift to a low carbon built environment will require both a step change in the energy performance of buildings alongside more efficient provision of energy services, and an aggressive decarbonisation of the energy used. Yet the prerequisite data of building stocks needed to support this essential shift in energy performance of buildings are not necessarily available or are inaccessible or incomplete. As more information on building energy use is collected through high frequency sensors and building form analytics become more sophisticated, the analysis methods applied to the myriad and diverse sub-sectors of the building stock 'population' need to be commensurate with the heterogeneity of the building stock. This paper describes and illustrates the basis of the IEA EBC Annex 70: Building Energy Epidemiology, which draws on the health sciences to posit 'energy epidemiology' as a whole-systemapproach for empirical research that provides a methodological framework for building physicists, engineers, social scientists, and economists to engage in cross-disciplinary studies. It makes the case that the development and application of an epidemiological approach to investigating energy demand can advance understanding of the inter-related factors for policy guidance and evaluation and provide insights on the mechanisms that influence energy demand. The aim of the IEA EBC Annex 70 is to work in an international collaboration to identify user needs around energy demand in buildings and to establish best practice methods and harmonized formats for data collection, analysis and modelling. To illustrate this process, we present an example from the UK on the application of energy epidemiological methods to building energy performance in the residential sector. The case study investigates the potential effectiveness of the policy and technical measures proposed by the UK Government. Policy implementation for broad, deep, and urgent reductions in energy demand from the building sector requires a far better understanding of the underlying relationships between people, energy use, buildings and the environment.

However, additional innovations are required to close the gap between DRI and net-zero steel. Pressurized chemical looping-DRI (PCL-DRI) is a novel technology explored to meet this target, in which the reformer firebox and fired process gas heaters are replaced with PCL combustion units. Captured CO2 is conditioned and compressed for pipeline transportation and storage/utilization. The performance of two different PCL-DRI configurations relative to traditional DRI processes was explored via process simulation: a Midrex-type process and an Energiron-type process. The PCL-DRI processes were shown to have equivalent or lesser total fuel consumption (8% reduction) compared to the base cases, and greater process water production (170-260% increase), with minimal or no loss in thermal efficiency. PCL-DRI is a strong competitor to alternative methods of reaching net-zero DRI due to lower energy penalties for carbon capture, no required changes to stream chemistry in or out of the EAF, and no requirement for hydrogen infrastructure.

Using panel data of 30 provinces for 1995-2017, we revisit China's energy-growth nexus that considers the likely cross-section dependence among the provinces within each of China's three regions. Our key finding is a bidirectional causal relationship of energy (natural log of per capita energy consumption) and income (natural log of per capita real GDP) for the Eastern and Central regions and a unidirectional causal relationship from income to energy for the Western region. The Eastern and Central regions' bidirectional relationship suggests caution in China's energy conservation policy which may decelerate these regions' economic growth. The Western region's unidirectional relationship suggests promoting energy conservation without adversely affecting this region's economic growth. Hence, the East and Central regions' conservation effort should be accompanied by cost-effective development of emissions-free renewable resources like hydro, solar and wind for displacing China's fossil-fuel consumption.

Capturing the learnings from leading demonstration projects is key for design optimisation, technology development and in turn, cost reduction. The importance of knowledge sharing and dissemination of learnings is of particular importance for CCS in order to maximise the cost-competitiveness of the technology across industry and energy markets and help reduce the overall costs to society for decarbonisation. Shell led the development of the Peterhead CCS (PCCS) project in the UK, from which the learnings from the completed front end engineering design (FEED) phase of the project have been identified and captured. In line with the agreement with the UK government, who sponsored part of the FEED phase, the learnings have been shared publically for the benefit of future follow on projects. The project completed FEED in 2015, the same year in which the project was cancelled due to UK Government withdrawal of funding for the UK CCS Commercialisation Competition. The Peterhead CCS project FEED phase comprised design work for CO2 capture from the Peterhead gas fired power station using Shell Cansolv technology. The project design also encompassed pipeline transport of the CO2 through an existing pipeline to the CO2 subsurface storage site in the North Sea Goldeneye reservoir, utilising the existing offshore platform. This paper provides an overview of learnings from across both the technical and non-technical spectrums, including key technical CCS specific topics, as well as learnings from engagement with stakeholders, and development of regulatory frameworks. The learnings shared can be applied to the design of future CCS projects to reduce costs, optimise the technology, and realise public and regulatory support. The development of the FEED provided confidence that the construction and operation of the PCCS project was feasible and that the project was in a position to advance to the next stage of the development.

J	Say, K; John, M				Say, Kelvin; John, Michele			Molehills into mountains: Transitional pressures from household PV-battery adoption under flat retail and feed-in tariffs	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Photovoltaics; Battery energy storage; Distributed energy resources; Prosumage; Open-source modelling; Energy system transitions		With Australia's significant existing household PV capacity, decreasing battery costs may lead to widespread household PV-battery adoption. As the sizing of these systems are heavily influenced by retail tariffs, this paper analyses the effect of flat retail tariffs on households free to invest in PV battery systems. Using Perth, Australia for context, an open-source model is used to simulate household PV battery investments over a 20-year period. We find that flat usage and feed-in tariffs lead to distinct residual demand patterns as households' transition from PV-only to PV-battery systems. Qualitatively analysing these patterns from the bottom-up, we identify transitional tipping points that may challenge future electricity system management, market participation and energy policies. The continued use of flat tariffs incentivises PV-battery households to maximise self-consumption, which reduces annual grid-imports, increases annual grid-exports, and shifts residual demand towards winter. Diurnal and seasonal demand patterns continue to change as PV-battery households eventually become net-generators. Unmanaged, these bottom-up changes may complicate energy decarbonisation efforts within centralised electricity markets and suggest that policymakers should prepare for PV-battery households to play a more active role in the energy system.

As a microcosm of modern cities, precincts are at the forefront for urban planning, development and assessment, as well as for exploring the carbon- neutral potential of the built environment. Despite many innovative solutions have been proposed for decarbonising precincts, carbon assessment and carbon-neutral potential exploration in the dynamic environment is remain challenging, due to the integration of complex morphological variations, demographical changes, on premises renewable energy production and electric vehicle uptakes. This research presents a preliminary study on the life cycle carbon assessment of residential precincts, as well as their carbon neutrality opportunities and options with dynamic settings. A case study with 100 scenarios is employed to explore critical factors in precinct decarbonisation. This is followed by comparative analysis of critical factors and their impacts on precinct carbon signature and carbon-neutral potential. The article concludes that changes in energy-efficiency of building types and in demographical characteristics are the two major factors influencing precinct carbon performance. Where, redevelopment of precinct with buildings of higher-rated energy efficiency and increase of on-site renewable energy uptake can have a long-term positive impact on precinct carbon performance. Moreover, improving energy efficiency through existing building refurbishment might of the potential for a fast-track of precinct carbon.

J	Kilkis, B				Kilkis, Birol			An exergy-based minimum carbon footprint model for optimum equipment oversizing and temperature peaking in low-temperature district heating systems	ENERGY			English	Article						Low-exergy; Low-temperature district heating; Equipment oversizing; Heat pump cascading; Temperature peaking; PVT system; Hydrogen house; Wind-to-heat; Hydrogen economy	ENERGY; CITIES; POWER	Total decarbonization strategies are facing technical and environmental challenges according to the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics, such as equipment oversizing versus temperature peaking by heat pumps to accommodate low-temperature renewable and waste energy sources. As a method of this paper, the Rational Exergy Management Model (REMM) derived fourteen metrics, aiming to minimize the CO2 emissions responsibility. Two case studies are presented. One of them is a fifth-generation district energy system concept with a 250 MW design heating load of 20,000 residence-equivalent apartments at a supply temperature of 35 degrees C. Results showed that two heat pumps in a cascade achieved a 23% higher exergy utilization rate with an optimum temperature peaking to 45 degrees C and 25% radiator oversizing. The second case study is concerned with the strategy of the Chinese government to substitute the domestic use of coal and wood with local wind turbines for electric heating to combat global warming. Five alternatives were considered; 1-Wind electricity to resistance heating, 2-Wind electricity to heat pumps, 3-Wind electricity to mini hydrogen fuel cells, 4-Wind electricity to hydrogen and micro-cogeneration, and 5-Hydrogen district systems with biogas, geothermal, and solar energy. Results showed that Case 1 has the maximum carbon footprint, whereas a custom-designed hydrogen house has the least footprint leading to about 90% CO2 emissions responsibility emanating from exergy destructions. The paper concludes that low-temperature heating either in district energy systems, in private buildings, or prosumers is both environmentally, economically, and technically feasible.

The innovative S-CCHP system is currently in operation in an industrial building located in Zaragoza (Spain), and the transient model developed to estimate the annual energy outputs has been validated. The system consists of hybrid photovoltaic-thermal (PV-T) collectors integrated via two parallel thermal storage tanks with an air-to-water reversible heat pump (rev-HP). Another contribution is that the detailed LCA analysis is also performed to a conventional PV-system and a grid-based system, viz building electricity consumption supplied from the grid (baseline configuration). The results show that the proposed S-CCHP system has half of the environmental impact of the grid-based system, according to the ReCiPe 2016 Endpoint (H/A) and the IPCC GWP 100a methods (4.48 kPts vs 8.87 kPts, and 82.4 tons of CO2 eq vs 166.9 tons of CO2 eq, respectively). The PV system has 30% less environmental impact than the grid-based system. Another novelty and contribution are the sensitivity analyses performed to assess the influence of the system lifetime, the solar irradiance and the power generation mix (also known as the electricity mix) on the LCA results. The results show that the proposed S-CCHP system appears as an up-and-coming alternative to reduce the environmental impacts of buildings in all the considered solar irradiance levels and electricity mix scenarios, even in climates with low irradiance levels or in countries with a highly decarbonised electricity supply.

For the first time in empirical literature, an econometric analysis includes the relative prices for several energy sources. The paper provides strong evidence on the relevance of energy prices to CO2 emissions. Accordingly, one reason for the lack of agreement in the EKC literature may be the absence of energy prices in empirical exercises. The presence of relative energy price changes in the econometric specification confirms a monotonic and positive relationship between CO2 and gross domestic product (GDP). Therefore, we may conclude that there is a decoupling process but without reaching any turning point on that relationship. The policy implications are straightforward. Direct climate action by policy makers is required to break the positive relationship between CO2 and GDP. That conclusion has been reinforced by the reduction of energy prices since the middle of 2014. Otherwise, the trend in energy prices may reverse the relative decarbonisation processes accounted for in recent years in major developed countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Gergondet, E				Gergondet, Edouard			The European Union's Proposed Carbon-Border Adjustment and Its Impact on Trade With Africa	GLOBAL TRADE AND CUSTOMS JOURNAL			English	Article						Africa; Algeria; Egypt; Libya; Morocco; Tunisia; Mozambique; South Africa; Zimbabwe; Trade; Environment; Energy; Carbon Leakage; Carbon Border Adjustment; Border Adjustment; European Union		On 11 December 2019, the European Commission officially presented its proposed carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), which seeks to address carbon leakage by putting a price on carbon-intense imports into the European Union (EU). In essence, importers in targeted sectors (cement, electricity, fertilizers, iron, steel and aluminium) would be required to monitor and declare greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions embedded in products coming from outside the EU so as to purchase and surrender each year 'certificates' offsetting such emissions. Such a carbon border adjustment, to the extent it only covers specific sectors, at least in its initial phase, would not equally affect African countries. Trade with most of the continent would - in general - not be subject to such an adjustment. However, specific industries, primarily in Northern and Southern Africa, including in least developed countries, would shoulder the pain associated with such an adjustment, both in terms of costs and risks of trade diversion. Africa has little contributed to the situation which the EU seeks to tackle by putting a price on carbon globally. In order to mitigate the impact on Africa, specific tools should be considered, including outright exclusions, reinforced cooperation towards decarbonization and partnerships building on existing trade agreements.

Facing this challenge, this paper presents a novel technology, based on a reversible High-Temperature Heat Pump (HTHP) and Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC). The proposed system recovers low-grade waste heat to generate electricity or useful heat in accordance with consumer demand. Compressor and expander semi-empirical models have been considered for the reversible system computational simulation, being HFC-245fa the working fluid selected. The built-in volume ratio and Internal Heat Exchanger (IHX) effectiveness have been optimized to reach the maximum energy efficiency in each operating condition. Although HFC-245fa exhibits energy performance attributes, its high Global Warming Potential (GWP) is an issue for climate change mitigation. Hence, multi-objective optimisation of the environmentally friendly working fluids Butane, Pentane, HFO-1336mzz(Z), R-514A, HCFO-1233zd(E) and HCFO-1224yd(Z) has been carried out. The results show that the system proposed, working with HFC-245fa, achieves a Coefficient of Performance (COP) of 2.44 for condensing temperature of 140 degrees C, operating in HTHP mode, whereas the ORC mode provides a net electrical efficiency of 8.7% at condensing temperature of 40 degrees C. Besides, HCFO-1233zd(E) and HCFO-1224yd(Z) are both appropriate alternatives for the HFC-245fa replacement. These working fluids provide a COP improvement of 9.7% and 5.8% and electrical net efficiency improvement of 2.1% and 0.8%, respectively, compared to HFC-245fa. This paper provides a reference study for further designs and developments of reversible HTHP-ORC systems used for industrial low-grade waste heat recovery.

ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Review						nonfullerene acceptors; organic photovoltaics	CHARGE-TRANSFER ABSORPTION; NON-FULLERENE ACCEPTORS; SOLAR-CELLS; QUANTUM EFFICIENCY	Efficient, low-cost, and low-embodied energy photovoltaics are key enablers of the global decarbonization agenda. In addition to the market-leading crystalline silicon technology, several other promising candidates are under active investigation with the perovskites leading the way with single-junction efficiencies exceeding 25% at the lab-scale. So-called organic photovoltaics (solar cells based upon organic semiconductors), particularly those that can be solution processed, have long promised the Nirvana of ultralow cost and very short energy payback times. However, relatively low efficiencies, poor long-term stability, and issues with manufacturing at scale have so far prevented truly meaningful commercialization of the technology. The recent emergence of the so-called nonfullerene electron acceptors is potentially about to shift this dynamic-they have delivered a step change in performance in a relatively short period of time. In this Essay, the basic properties of these new materials, their pros and cons, what we know and what we do not know are explored.

In order to replace the larger oil-based part of marine fuel with components from renewable sources, it is necessary to develop multi-component blends. In this work, biomethanol and biodiesel with two additives-dodecanol and 2-ethylhexyl nitrate-in 20 blends with marine diesel oil (MDO) were selected as alternative components to replace the pure marine diesel oil-based part of marine fuel. For this purpose, two base blends of diesel and biodiesel with and without additives were produced with biomethanol from 0 to 30% (volume basis). Of all the blends, the blends with 5% (volume basis) methanol had the best property profile in terms of density, kinematic viscosity, calorific value, cloud point, and cetane index according to the ISO 8217:2017 standard (DMB grade) in compliance with the IMO requirements for marine fuels. However, the flash point must be increased. The boiling behavior of the blends was also investigated. A cluster analysis was used to evaluate the similarity between the blends based on their different physical properties.

SUSTAINABILITY			English	Review						green technology; sustainability; climate change; Southeast Asia; energy policy		Southeast Asia faces one of the fastest growths in electricity demand in the world, driven by increasing incomes, urbanization and industrialization. Development and deployment of green energy technologies offer a natural conduit to meet the growing electricity needs of the Association of Southeast Asian Economies (ASEAN) region while also serving as a viable strategy to adapt to climate change. The aim of this study is to formulate the policy lessons for the ASEAN economies and governments in facilitating the development and deployment of green technologies and alternatives energy options based on a specific case review of the ASEAN. The ASEAN economic region is prioritizing sustainable economic growth while minimizing the regional impacts of climate change through decarbonization. The study undertakes a case-specific analysis in reviewing green energy deployment in the context of green growth and energy transition using secondary data sources and discusses the current status and future options of renewable energy development in the ASEAN. We find that carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies will allow the ASEAN to continue to use fossil fuels while achieving sustainable economic growth as coal demand increases in the region. The deployment of CCS technologies will also act as an enabler of hydrogen energy as a green energy solution in the region in the longer term. Boosting public acceptance to nuclear energy, implementing energy efficiency improvement policies and eliminating fossil fuels consumption subsidies are feasible short-term and medium-term policies. Increasing both the public and private sector energy investments and development of CCS technologies in the longer term are necessary complementary policies to maximize the benefits of greater deployment of renewable energy sources in the region and combat climate change.

Based on the wealth of evidence that has emerged from the scientific literature during the first two years of the pandemic, this study argues that these two global crises require holistic multisectoral mitigation strategies. Despite being different in nature, neither crisis can be effectively mitigated without considering their interdependencies. Herein, significant interactions between these two crises are highlighted and discussed. Major implications related to the economy, energy, technology, environment, food systems and agriculture sector, health systems, policy, management, and communities are detailed via a review of existing joint literature. Based on these outcomes, practical recommendations for future research and management are provided. While the joint timing of these crises has created a global conundrum, the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated opportunities and lessons for devising sustainable recovery plans in relation to the climate crisis. The findings indicated that governments should work collaboratively to develop durable and adjustable strategies in line with long-term, global decarbonisation targets, promote renewable energy resources, integrate climate change into environmental policies, prioritise climate-smart agriculture and local food systems, and ensure public and ecosystem health. Further, differences in geographic distributions of climate change and COVID-19 related death cases revealed that these crises pose different threats to different parts of the world. These learnings provide insights to address the climate emergency - and potential future global problems with similar characteristics - if international countries act urgently and collectively.

J	Bigerna, S; Bollino, CA; Polinori, P				Bigerna, Simona; Bollino, Carlo Andrea; Polinori, Paolo			Convergence in renewable energy sources diffusion worldwide	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Renewable energy sources; Conditional convergence; Worldwide countries data set	INTENSITY CONVERGENCE; DIVERGENCE; EUROPE	The diffusion of renewable energy sources (RES) is a fundamental objective of the worldwide policy actions for sustainable development, at the UN level with the sustainable development goals (SDG) recommendations, to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all (SDG 7). Also, primary attention to RES has been given at the EU level with the new Green Deal and the new objectives of the Next Generation EU after the Covid pandemic, and at the level of national Governments worldwide. So far, there has not been an analysis of the RES convergence process across countries worldwide, given that the issue of climate change is a global externality. Previous analyses have focused on specific regions, such as EU, OECD, provinces of China. This paper fills this gap, providing new evidence on the convergence process of RES for the 176 countries that account for more than 98% of the world population, from 1990 to 2018. A common panel data set has been used to take into account countries' specific effects. Several socio-economics and political variables are introduced to test conditional convergence such as openness to trade, developments in financial markets, income distribution, level of education. The results of this new contribution reveal that there is evidence of sigma-absolute and conditional beta-convergence process for several groups of countries. Moreover, the conditional convergence analysis shows that spatial spillover effects exert rich and complex impact on convergence speed. Finally, we provide policy recommendations, highlighting that the decarbonization target in 2050 needs additional mobilization of public and private resources to pursue a common, convergence path worldwide.

Erinc			Potential effects of the EU's carbon border adjustment mechanism on the Turkish economy	ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						European green deal; Carbon border adjustment; Turkey; Input-output methodology; Applied general equilibrium	GROWTH	In December 2019, the EU announced the European Green Deal (EGD) to create a climate-neutral continent by 2050. Accordingly, the EU Emission Trading System (ETS) will be revised to maintain economic growth against possible losses in competitiveness, leading to "carbon leakage." Carbon border adjustment (CBA) is one of the mechanisms proposed to tackle the carbon leakage problem. In this paper, we provide a first-order estimate of the potential impacts of a possible CBA across production sectors and build a dynamic, multi-sectoral applied general equilibrium (AGE) model to study the overall macroeconomic impact of the EGD on the Turkish economy. Then, we extend our analysis to document the potential benefits of a more active climate policy. The model is in the Walrasian tradition wherein aggregate supply and demand actions are simulated with the interplay of relative prices to bring equilibrium in the markets for goods, for labor, and for foreign exchange. Constructed around 24 production sectors, the model accommodates flexible, multi-level functional forms to link production activities with gaseous emissions, a government entity to maintain taxation, and public expenditures, as well as administration of environmental policy instruments, all within an open-economy macroeconomic environment. Our results suggest that the potential adverse impact of the CBA on the Turkish economy would range between 2.7 and 3.6% loss of the GDP by 2030 over the business-as-(un)usual base path. We also document that under an alternative scenario through which Turkey is modeled as an active agent in the international climate policy arena embedding decarbonization into her official macroeconomic policy agenda, she can achieve a superior pathway for national income and a reduced carbon burden.

The "Beautiful China" strategy, launched by the Chinese government in 2020, requires that all cities in China attain 35 mu g/m(3) or below for annual mean concentration of PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 mu m) by 2035. Meanwhile, China adopts a portfolio of low-carbon policies to meet its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) pledged in the Paris Agreement. Previous studies demonstrated the cobenefits to air pollution reduction from implementing low-carbon energy policies. Pathways for China to achieve dual targets of both air quality and CO2 mitigation, however, have not been comprehensively explored. Here, we couple an integrated assessment model and an air quality model to evaluate air quality in China through 2035 under the NDC scenario and an alternative scenario (Co-Benefit Energy [CBE]) with enhanced low-carbon policies. Results indicate that some Chinese cities cannot meet the PM2.5 target under the NDC scenario by 2035, even with the strictest end-of-pipe controls. Achieving the air quality target would require further reduction in emissions of multiple air pollutants by 6 to 32%, driving additional 22% reduction in CO2 emissions relative to the NDC scenario. Results show that the incremental health benefit from improved air quality of CBE exceeds 8 times the additional costs of CO2 mitigation, attributed particularly to the cost-effective reduction in household PM2.5 exposure. The additional low-carbon energy polices required for China's air quality targets would lay an important foundation for its deep decarbonization aligned with the 2 degrees C global temperature target.

Yet a lack of technical and commercial maturity of CDR technologies hinders potential deployment. Needs for commercialization span research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) activities, including development of new materials, reactors, and processes, and rigorous monitoring of a portfolio of demonstration projects. As a world leader in supporting science and engineering, the United States (US) can play an important role in reducing costs and clarifying the sustainable scale of CDR. To date, federal agencies have focused on voluntary or piecemeal CDR programs. Here, we present a synthesis of research and developement needs, relevant agency authority, barriers to coordination, and interventions to enhance RD&D across the federal government of the US. On the basis of agency authority and expertise, the Department of Energy, Department of Agriculture, Department of the Interior, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and National Science Foundation are most central to conducting research, funding projects, monitoring effects, and promulgating regulations. Key enablers for successful programs include embracing technological diversity and administrative efficiency, fostering agency buy-in, and achieving commercial deployment. Based on these criteria, the executive branch could effectively coordinate RD&D strategy through two complementary pathways: (1) renewing intra-agency commitment to CDR in five primary agencies, including both research and demonstration, and (2) coordinating research prioritization and outcomes across agencies, led by the Office of Science and Technology Policy and loosely based on the National Nanotechnology Initiative. Both pathways can be stimulated by executive order or Congressional mandate. Executive branch implementation can begin at any time; future Farm and Energy Bills provide legislative vehicles for enhancing programs.				dsanchez@carnegiescience.edu			David and Lucile Packard Foundation; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation	David and Lucile Packard Foundation(The David & Lucile Packard Foundation); Alexander von Humboldt Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation)	Weare indebted to Julio Friedmann, Noah Deich, Janie Wise Thompson, and Christopher Field for comments on earlier versions of this manuscript.

J	Chen, H; Chen, WY				Chen, Han; Chen, Wenying			Carbon mitigation of China's building sector on city-level: Pathway and policy implications by a low-carbon province case study	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						City-level emissions; Building sector; Energy consumption; Emission peak; Low-carbon province	RESIDENTIAL COMBUSTION; SCENARIO ANALYSIS; CO2 EMISSIONS; ENERGY USE; SIMULATION; INVENTORY; BENEFITS; CITIES	Curbing the increasing carbon emissions from residential and commercial buildings would be of great importance for achieving China's NDC (Nationally Determined Contributions) target. However, studies on city-level emission pathways and mitigation strategies aiming at building sector are still far from sufficient, especially for regions in Central China. Considering the large potential for further building energy demand increase within this area, this study focuses on Hubei, one of the first batch low-carbon pilot provinces to investigate the possibility of earlier emission peak and reduction potentials by prefecture-level city. When downscaling provincial energy use and emissions estimated from local government plans and academic research, statistical data was applied to exploring the relationship between building energy consumption and socioeconomic variables, then spatial allocation factor could be generated after combining with projections of grid-level GDP and population. Results show that by replacing coal and natural gas (NG) that are currently the main heating & cooking energy sources with more electricity and renewable energy, emissions from the building sector would peak around 2025, which is especially true for three major big cities with higher emission growth rate due to population and urban expansions. Moreover, when considering additional improvement on building energy efficiency, provincial reductions burden would be more evenly distributed among cities. It is implied that by formulating tiered mitigation policies for cities at various economic development levels, including decarbonization of energy structure and improvement of energy efficiency, more cities would peak their emissions from the building sector before 2030. This analytical framework innovatively create a multi-city platform for the simulation of building sector mitigation pathway to facilitate cities' low-carbon development. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Murakami, S; Yamamoto, H; Toyota, T				Murakami, Shinsuke; Yamamoto, Haruhisa; Toyota, Terufumi			Potential Impact of Consumer Intention on Generation of Waste Photovoltaic Panels: A Case Study for Tokyo	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						waste PV panels; generation forecast; consumer's intention; Tokyo	LIFE-SPAN; COMMODITIES	As the world moves toward decarbonization, Japan is experiencing a rapid introduction of solar modules. However, the country does not have an adequate social system for managing waste photovoltaic (PV) panels. A waste generation estimate would be needed to do this effectively. Usually, waste generation estimation is performed by assuming that the lifespan distribution is primarily dependent on the mechanical life of the target item. However, considering the continuing improvement in panel quality, consumers consider replacement or disposal before mechanical failure of the product. Therefore, to study consumer intention, we surveyed potential consumer decision making on replacement/disposal via a questionnaire survey and attempted to include the result as part of our waste panel generation estimation, which, to our knowledge, has never previously been carried out. Considering the owners' decision making, waste panel generation was in advance compared with the case where we only assumed the mechanical failure of panels and housings. This indicated a huge number of potentially reusable panel generations. In addition to mechanical failure, waste panel generation due to owners' decisions should also be considered for estimating maximum potential waste. Policy makers should prepare the appropriate recycling social system in advance, considering the possible reuse of panels, which fits the current social situation oriented toward a circular economy.

While this is an impressive amount of PV growth, it contributes less than 3% of total electricity generation and, therefore, requires significantly more PV to decarbonize the electricity sector completely. In order to achieve this decarbonization sustainably, all factors must be considered, including the extraction and purification of abundant materials. Based on conservative and ambitious future PV production scenarios and learning rate (LR) for material consumption reduction, the material demands for the future are projected. The concept of LR is applied to estimate the reduced material consumption based on the "maturity" of PV technology or the cumulative installed PV capacity. Herein, it is suggested that abundant materials like copper, concrete, and aluminum may face shortages if PV production follows the broad electrification scenario. Steel, in comparison, likely does not encounter any material shortages. Nevertheless, the work here demonstrates that the demand for even abundant materials should be minimized to decarbonize energy usage and mitigate climate change sustainably.

This was performed based on the selected economic, environmental, and technical criteria by the authors guided by the experts' judgements in the weighing process. The main criteria also included various sub-criteria. The sub-criteria of the economic criterion included distance from transmission lines, topography, and distance to roads. The environmental sub-criteria covered land use, sensitive areas, and protected areas. The technical sub-criteria were on distance from demand centers, available potential energy resources (solar and hydro), and climate (rainfall and sunshine). The weights of the main criteria and the sub-criteria were calculated by using the fuzzy AHP. These weights were then used in the GIS environment to determine both the potential for power generation from the solar energy resource and the smart grid suitable areas. According to the weight results, the economic criteria has the highest weight, followed by environmental and technical criteria. The validation of the experts' judgements for each criterion by comparing the results from fuzzy AHP with AHP confirmed insignificant differences in weights for all criteria. The obtained suitable smart grid areas in Western Uganda have been classified into three parts, that is, the South, North, and Central. Therefore, this is a one-of-a-kind study that, in the authors' view, will provide the initial insights to the government, policymakers, renewable energy practitioners, and researchers to investigate, map, and embrace decarbonization strategies for the electricity sector of Uganda.

Techno-economic analysis (TEA) is a valuable tool for understanding how to inform research directions that could make hydrogen from electrolysis cost competitive with that produced by conventional means like steam methane reforming. The current state of knowledge on TEA of electrolysis systems suggests cost reductions are likely to result from advances in system design and materials, scale-up of manufacturing processes, and learning by doing effects as electrolysis deployment increases. Future directions and opportunities for TEA of electrolysis systems include dispatchable operation in wholesale power markets, optimization of capital cost and system durability, and analysis of pathways for hydrogen to support economy-wide decarbonization.

The complexity of interactions between thermal-hydraulic components in these systems requires moving from a steady-state analysis to a dynamic approach. Commercial dynamic process simulators provide a good platform to model and simulate the physics phenomena of these components. However, co-simulation between software engines is often necessary to incorporate process control systems and regulate key system variables. This paper presents the co-simulation of a real heating application from a civil building for health services integrating thermal energy storage (TES) units. A detailed dynamic model of the heating system under study is developed in Apros, a commercial dynamic process simulator. The process control system responsible for regulating the hydraulic pumps, valves, and heat sources is implemented in MATLAB/Simulink. The TES system is operated by the process control system based on a daily schedule, achieving a reduced utilisation of the heat generation units during peak-demand hours.

China needs a power industry with deep decarbonization and high energy efficiency in the next 40 years. The adjustment of electric power structure mainly contains two parts: (1) The transition of thermal power generation to renewable energy power generation. (2) The transition of low-parameter thermal power generating to high-parameter thermal power generating. Here this paper predicted the total power-generating capacity in the future 40 years using multivariable linear regression and LEAP (Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System) methods. Afterwards, based on baseline and policy-driven (China's energy and electric power development plan in 2030 and prospect in 2060) scenarios, this study projected the proportions of different power generation technologies/different parameters of thermal power plants using Origin and historical data. This research also used LCI (life cycle inventory) to obtain energy-saving and environmental benefits in the transitions of thermal energy to renewable energy power generation/low-parameter to high-parameter thermal power generating. Results showed that in policy-driven scenario, wind power and photovoltaic power generation will reach 36.5% and 36.9% of total power generation respectively by 2060. Moreover, renewable and new energy power generation will save 5780 million tons standard coal and 14,512 million tons of CO2 emissions by 2060. Super thermal power generation, however, was predicted to expand 1690 billion kWh from 2017 to 2050 for its large environmental benefits but phase out gradually from 2050 to 2060 to achieve Chinese government's "carbon neutrality " goal.

Two hardening environments were used: a conventional climate chamber as a reference (0.04 % CO2) and a climatic chamber for accelerated carbonation (5% CO2), with curing times of 1, 3, and 7 days. A volumetric substitution method where NA was replaced with RMA did not significantly affect its mechanical properties. Accelerated carbonation reduced the curing time, improved mechanical properties, increased dry bulk density, and decreased accessible porosity for water for all the mixes studied. The maximum CO2 sequestration for cement-based materials made with mixed recycled aggregates was 27 kg CO2/t of mix. Accelerated carbonation of fresh cement-based products containing RMA is a promising CO2 capture and utilisation technology for precast non-reinforced concrete product manufacturing.

Exploring the role of perceived social impacts in mode choice in five European countries	ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Mode choice; Travel behaviour; Attitudes; Commute; Conditional multinomial logit	TRAVEL BEHAVIOR; PROBLEM AWARENESS; PERSONAL NORM; TRANSPORT; ATTITUDES; TIME; AUTOMOBILE; JOURNEYS; MOBILITY; HABIT	Shifting away from private vehicle use in urban areas is a necessary step in the decarbonisation of mobility. A thorough understanding of the determinants of travel mode choice is paramount for developing policies that can effectively nudge people to make this shift. This paper analyses mode choice in commuting and grocery shopping journeys considering attitudes towards mobility, socio-economic factors and journey characteristics. A multinomial logistic regression is performed on survey data from 5028 household in five European countries (Hungary, Italy, Poland, Norway and Spain) to describe the choice between private vehicle, public transport and active modes. Measures for perception of negative transport externalities (that is indirect negative impacts from road transport activity) and support for sustainable mobility transition policies are considered. Results show that commuters more sensitive to negative transport externalities prefer private vehicles to public transport or active travel. This suggests a paradox may exist with respect to the perception of these externalities. Other factors such as journey characteristics, policy intervention support and family size have also a strong influence on mode choice.

Predicting thermal excursions during in situ oxidative regeneration of packed bed catalytic fast pyrolysis catalyst	REACTION CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING			English	Article							BIO-OIL; CONDUCTIVITY; BIOMASS; VAPORS; KINETICS; QUALITY	Ex situ catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) uses a secondary reactor to upgrade biomass pyrolysis vapors to stabilized CFP oils with reduced oxygen content. In one configuration, the secondary reactor is operated as a packed-bed swing reactor system which allows coke-deactivated beds to be decarbonized in situ while other beds remain online for vapor upgrading. In situ decarbonization must be done carefully to avoid irreversible deactivation and/or physical degradation of catalyst pellets. Given that packed bed reactors are well known to have poor heat transfer characteristics, this is a critical issue impacting scaleability and commercial viability of the technology. To predict thermal excursions during regeneration, finite element computational models have been built to assist in scaling up oxidative decarbonization of a Pt/TiO2 CFP catalyst (0.5 mm spheres) from a bench scale packed bed with 100 g of catalyst to a pilot scale packed bed with 2 kg of catalyst and internal cooling tubes. Based on transient measurements of outlet temperature and effluent CO2 concentration, and using an assumed coke profile and activation energy, this paper demonstrates that specific combinations of effective thermal conductivity and wall heat transfer coefficient can fit bench scale oxidative regeneration data equally well. For the upscaled 2 kg bed, four bench-scale "best fit" parameter pairs give different predictions for location and magnitude of thermal excursions, with the maximum computed bed temperature gradients ranging from 30 degrees C cm(-1) to as high as 3000 degrees C cm(-1). The larger the fraction of heat removal by conduction through the cooling tubes, the greater the differences between the parameter pairs. The modelling results presented in this paper cast doubt on the industrial viability of the proposed combination of catalyst, bed and regeneration process, and point to the need for alternate reactor designs. However, there is considerable uncertainly in some of the key model parameters. The reliability of model predictions can be increased by adding more temperature measurements at key bed locations, testing additional variations in process conditions, performing careful bed dissections to determine the true coke profile, and perhaps most importantly, directly measuring the effective thermal conductivity of the catalyst pellets.

J	Roman-Collado, R; Carmona, MJC				Roman-Collado, Rocio; Colinet Carmona, Maria Jose			Energy efficiency's key role in explaining the performance of energy consumption in Andalusia (Spain)	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article						Energy efficiency; Energy decoupling; European decarbonisation; LMDI; Energy policy; European regions	SPATIAL DECOMPOSITION ANALYSIS; CO2 EMISSIONS; DRIVING FORCES; INDEX DECOMPOSITION; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; LABOR PRODUCTIVITY; INTENSITY CHANGES; CARBON INTENSITY; CHINA; POLICY	The EU commitment to improve energy efficiency is conditioned not only by the countries but also by the role that the European regions adopt when they develop their own energy policies. Concretely, due to the economic and energy characteristics of the Andalusia, this region conditions the achievement of Spain's goals in terms of energy efficiency. This paper aims to highlight the key role played by energy efficiency, explaining the energy consumption behaviour in Andalusia and in comparison with the Spanish average for the period 2000-2015. The paper analyses this topic through the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) decomposition method and with a decoupling index analysis. The results show although the energy efficiency measures have been globally effective in terms of reducing the energy intensity between 2000 and 2015, Andalusia still has a higher energy intensity than the Spanish average and more efforts should be made in order to reduce it and to contribute to Spain's energy consumption targets. The main efforts should be focused on the industry and primary sectors. The energy policy recommendation are two. First, to bring the economic situation of Andalusia closer to the Spanish average and therefore to reduce energy intensity and second, to decouple the energy consumption from economic growth, thus contributing to a reduction in CO2 emissions.

J	Lange, M; Cummins, V				Lange, Marcus; Cummins, Valerie			Managing stakeholder perception and engagement for marine energy transitions in a decarbonising world	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS			English	Article						Marine governance; Marine renewable energy; Marine energy; Corrib Gas field; Ireland; Energy transition; Public engagement; Public participation	GOVERNANCE; SUSTAINABILITY; COMMUNITIES; RELEVANCE; IRELAND; PLACE; TRUST	There is a growing body of scholarship on the enabling conditions for energy transitions in various energy contexts globally. Transition measures need to address the concerns of communities that will host renewable energy infrastructure. Despite this, the consequences of energy transitions at the community level and in coastal environments have not received adequate attention. The case of the Corrib Gas field development in Ireland provides valuable insights into stakeholder issues surrounding strategic infrastructure developments. Material from case study work with over 70 stakeholders in a rural coastal region in Ireland's West is used to identify the cause of disputes in energy governance. The study shows that economic development is strongly linked to the cultural fabric, not just of the country, but of the locality. Here, a lack of trust of those in power had an influence on the conflict. The appointment of a mediator as an honest broker was a tipping point towards diffusion of tension and an adaptive response by all parties. The establishment of a body with a mandate to evaluate the application of ethical rules, based on good governance principles, is suggested as an option for a refined governance model. The insights are relevant for the energy transition in jurisdictions around the world. Given the urgent need for decarbonisation and the potential for marine renewable energy, lessons from the past, as documented in this paper, can help to inform better governance of common pool marine resources. This is increasingly important for the industrialisation of marine renewable energy and the need to reconcile the interests of government, industry and civil society.

First, the two martensites are assumed to have body-centered tetragonal lattice structures of different tetragonal ratios. X-ray diffraction is then applied to obtain the overlapping {200} diffraction peak, which is subsequently separated as four sub-peaks using a self-made multiple Gaussian peak-fitting method to allow the measurement of the individual lattice parameters c and a. Finally, a modified equation is applied to calculate the carbon contents from the obtained tetragonal ratios. The new technique is then applied to investigate the effect of subsequent tempering on the decarbonization of the as-quenched martensites.

Within this context, decision-makers' choices need to comprehensively consider potential sustainability effects associated with bioenergy systems. In particular, due to the lack of studies addressing the social sustainability of bioelectricity, the present work applies the Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA) methodology to compare the social performance of two biomass-to-electricity systems located in Portugal based on either fluidised-bed or grate furnace technology. S-LCA involves a comprehensive approach for holistic evaluation and data interpretation of social aspects. Six social indicators were benchmarked: child labour, forced labour, gender wage gap, women in the sectoral labour force, health expenditure, and contribution to economic development. The results show that the implementation of fluidised-bed furnaces as a more efficient conversion technology could reduce by 15-19% the selected negative social impacts, except women in the sectoral labour force. When enlarging the interpretation to a sustainability perspective, the general suitability of the fluidised-bed furnace system would be further emphasised under environmental aspects while jointly providing valuable insights for informed decision-making and sustainability reporting.

The development and real-world implementation of such innovative concepts can be enhanced through urban energy modelling. However, assessing PEDs can be challenging, and information on this topic is scarce and fragmented. The main contribution of this paper is collecting and analyzing challenges and limitations of energy modelling software for assessing PEDs through five case studies in Italy, Spain, The Netherlands, Denmark and Canada. Case studies are assessed first from a modelling approach, then the main identified challenges and limitations of modelling tools for PEDs are discussed, and finally, various ongoing trends and research needs in this field are suggested.

Universities, the maximum energetic corporations and places for clinical studies and social activities, have a duty to assemble low-carbon campuses and play a vital function in lowering CO2 emissions. An environmental life cycle assessment was conducted to compare proposed municipal solid waste (MSW) treatment systems with the existing system in the residential university campus (RUC) in Kharagpur, West Bengal (India). The results show the existing MSW disposal practice in RUC (baseline scenario has the highest GWP (1388 kg CO2 eq), which can potentially be reduced by adopting integrated waste management system with source segregation as represented in futuristic scenarios (S2-50% sorting) and (S3-90% sorting)). Compared to S1, GHG emission was reduced by 50.9% in S2 and by 86.5% in S3. Adopting anaerobic digestion and engineered landfill without energy recovery offsets the environmental emissions and contributes to significant environmental benefits in terms of ecological footprints. Capital goods play a pivotal role in mitigation the environmental emissions. The shift towards S2 and S3 requires infrastructure for waste collection and sorting will contribute to reduction of associated environmental costs in the long-term.

For instance, system strength is directly affected by the decommissioning of traditional synchronous generator units in favour of renewable energy units. While synchronous units provide inertia to the system, renewable units are effectively decoupled from the grid via power electronics. This transition unequivocally leads to a decrease in system stability. Particularly, isolated systems are more exposed to these problems as they tend to be smaller and have faster dynamics. Therefore, it is important to know the system inertia constant after a sudden disturbance as it may help to predict the possible nadir frequency. Obtaining the inertia constant is a hard task due to the many parameters that have to be monitored. Hence, inertia estimation methods based on disturbance measurements have been used for a while. In this study, a comparison between different approaches is analysed. In the meantime, this paper aims to give a more practical approach to the selected method.

Initially, Coelestrella sp SVMIICT5 was grown in a 5 L photo-bioreactor and scaled up to a 50 L flat-panel photo-bioreactor using DWW. The microalgal growth showed higher photosynthetic efficiency, resulting in a biomass growth of 3.2 g/L of DCW with 87% treatment efficiency. The biomolecular composition showed 26% lipids with a good fatty acid profile (C-12-C-21) as well as carbohydrate (24.9%) and protein (31.8%) content. In the second stage, the de-oiled algal biomass was valorized via HTL at various temperatures (150 & DEG;C, 200 & DEG;, and 250 & DEG;C) and reaction atmospheres (N-2 and H-2). Among these, the 250 & DEG;C (H-2) condition showed a 52% bio-crude fraction and an HHV of & SIM;29.47 MJ/kg (bio-oil) with a saturated hydrocarbon content of 64.3% that could be further upgraded to jet fuels. The energy recovery (73.01%) and elemental enrichment (carbon; 65.67%) were relatively greater in H-2 compared to N-2 conditions. Finally, dark fermentation of the complex-structured HTL-AF stream resulted in a total bio-H-2 production of 231 ml/g of TOC with a 63% treatment efficiency. Life cycle analysis (LCA) was also performed for the mid-point and damage categories to assess the sustainability of the integrated process. Thus, the results of this study demonstrated comprehensive wastewater treatment and valorization of de-oiled algal biomass for chemical/fuel intermediates in the biorefinery context by low-carbon processes.

J	Novoselova, LV				Novoselova, Lyubov, V			MODERN CHINA: CHANGING ECONOMIC PARADIGM	MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA			Russian	Article						economic model; domestic demand; poverty alleviation; disposable income; taxation; innovation; technology; R&D; eco-environment; pollution; investment; energy consumption; carbon intensity; decarbonization		The article presents the key directions of China's socio-economic policy since the XVIII Congress of the CPC (2012), which introduced the fifth generation of Chinese leaders led by Xi Jinping. The emphasis is placed on the consideration of the main components of China's transition to a new model of economic development. Assessing institutional changes with regard to this task, the author argues that alongside with strengthening market principles in the economy, they provide for enhancing the supervisory and regulatory functions of the government based on a number of newly adopted laws and regulations. The authorities' efforts to improve people's wellbeing and expand domestic demand extended to the creation of a comprehensive social security system, state support for the poor, tax relief, ensuring good conditions for small businesses, developing education and medical services. As a result in early 2020s the PRC declared overcoming absolute poverty and building a moderately prosperous society. Favorable framework was provided for the science and technology development, e.g. growing R&D spending, tax benefits, the creation of numerous innovation centers, as well as expanding international cooperation in science and technology. This allowed the PRC to become one of the world leaders in a number of aspects of innovative development. China's green and carbon transition policy meets the terms of the Paris Agreement on climate and provides for establishing stringent eco-environmental protection systems as well as changing energy mix through closure of carbon-intensive industries, stimulating eco-friendly technologies, creation of a national carbon market, etc. All this gives hope for a gradual improvement of the country's eco-environment. Currently, China's economy bears visible traces of its transition to a new development model. Despite all its problems and global challenges, the macro- and microeconomic results of the policy, pursued by the Chinese leadership, cause reasonable optimism about the country's further development.

J	Bang, G; Rosendahl, KE; Bohringer, C				Bang, Guri; Rosendahl, Knut Einar; Boehringer, Christoph			Balancing cost and justice concerns in the energy transition: comparing coal phase-out policies in Germany and the UK	CLIMATE POLICY			English	Article						Coal phase-out; energy transition; just transition concerns; Germany; UK	INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FIRED POWER; VARIETIES; POLITICS; ECONOMY; PRICE	Europe's two largest economies - Germany and the UK - are phasing out coal from electricity production as part of European efforts to fulfil increased climate policy ambitions that require comprehensive energy system transitions. German and UK governments varied in the ways they sought support from diverse societal interests to make the transition socially acceptable and politically feasible. Drawing on 22 expert interviews and process-tracing methods, this paper compares and explains how political and economic institutional differences influenced efforts to balance energy transition concerns, like speed and cost-effectiveness with justice for companies, workers and communities most adversely affected by the transition. We find that the increasing attention to just transition perspectives after the Paris Agreement affected the design of coal phase-out processes in different ways in the two countries. Just transition concerns were given priority by policymakers in Germany, but more so if they overlapped with the interests of incumbents. In the end, politically powerful stakeholders dominated the policy outcome. In the UK, policymakers and stakeholders gave only weak attention to just transition concerns, mainly because coal's market position had collapsed. Coal interests did not have strong representation in the decision-making process. But we find that just transition concerns are likely to gain more attention in the UK because a more challenging transition away from gas will take place over the next two decades. Key policy insights Policymakers must balance the objective of a fast decarbonization process against two other important concerns: cost-effectiveness and a just transition. Political-economic institutional design and capacity shape the extent to which just transition concerns are given weight in coal phase-out processes. State capacity for including just transition concerns in coal phase-out processes is higher when political and economic institutions strongly mediate government-stakeholder interaction in the policy process, and broad stakeholder participation increases the political feasibility and legitimacy of policy change. In Germany, the government's attention to just transition concerns was strong because broad stakeholder representation in the formal process, and transition assistance policies to target potential losers in the transition, became crucial to enhance the legitimacy of coal phase-out policies. In the UK, cost-effectiveness trumped just transition concerns in the coal phase-out process, but just transition issues have increasing salience and will likely become pertinent in the upcoming gas phase-out process because more jobs and key economic interests are at stake. Our findings are relevant for policymakers in countries struggling with balancing speed, cost-effectiveness and just transition concerns in similar transition processes: phasing out coal, gas, or oil from their energy system. The findings may also inform future energy transition research.

The unbalanced spatial distribution between energy resources and demands and the remarkable differences in power-generation capabilities among regions are important factors that impede decarbonization of China's electricity sector. Utilization of the abundant low-carbon energy resources in the central and western regions is restricted by limited local demand. Energy demand in these regions accounts for approximately 26% of the entire nation's demand. By comparison, the regions have more than 45% of the energy resources. However, long-distance energy delivery incurs considerable losses. At present, approximately 80% of inter-regional energy delivery uses primary coal transport and 20% travels by secondary electricity transmission. The Chinese government is planning to build an ambitious inter-regional transmission grid for energy delivery. We demonstrate that this plan would significantly change the current delivery patterns and improve delivery efficiency. Approximately 40% of inter-regional energy delivery would travel by secondary electricity transmission and a 25% improvement in the delivery efficiency of the entire system is expected. Therefore, utilization of low-carbon energy resources would be promoted and overall carbon emission would be reduced. Using a fine-grained electricity dispatch model to simulate and optimize the operation of the power system, the carbon emission mitigation potential is quantitatively assessed based on real planning data. The results indicate a significant 10% reduction in CO2 emissions in 2030, amounting to 0.49 Gt. This reduction should be included as an important component for the sector's low-carbon budget. Finally, we assess the potential for further reductions in carbon emissions by making modifications to the planned transmission grid. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we quantify net revenue and downstream flow impact trade-offs of a cascading series of 36 small-scale hydropower facilities under consideration for development in Northeast California. To do so, we develop a net-revenue-maximizing optimization model that determines hydropower operations while capturing key technical and river network constraints. We find that significantly constraining maximum discharges from each facility largely eliminates downstream flow impacts but negligibly changes the 36 facilities' combined operations and net revenues. Thus, we find a negligible trade-off between net revenues and downstream impacts in our study system, suggesting small-scale hydropower can contribute to decarbonization efforts while limiting local environmental impacts on downstream flows at little economic cost.

J	Liu, XF				Liu, Xiaofei			The supervision and multi-sectoral guarantee mechanism of the global marine sulphur limit-assessment from Chinese shipping industry	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						marine sulphur limit; emission control area; air and climate governance; maritime climate change; exhaust gas cleaning system; maritime supervision		To significantly reduce sulfur oxides emissions from fossil fuel-powered ships, reduce air pollution in ports and slow ocean acidification, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has imposed the new 0.50%m/m limit (reduced from 3.50%m/m in the past) on sulphur in ships' fuel oil. This has given rise to a host of issues regarding fuel replenishment operations, safe operation management, maritime regulation, and coordinated governance of air and climate. In response to ocean acidification and climate change, regulations on the use of low-sulfur oil or alternative fuels by ships greatly reduce sulfur oxide emissions, but have no significant impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, the refining process for low-sulfur fuels and the use of the gas cleaning system on ships both increase energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. To ensure the decarbonization process of shipping industry, there is an urgent need for a conceptual change in global ocean governance so as to promote the coordinated governance of air pollution and climate change. China's conception of "a maritime community with a shared future" provides a new model for global ocean governance. The Chinese government has formulated regulations at different levels to promote the coordinated management of atmospheric pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions. Regarding supervision of sulfur oxide emissions from ships, this study proposes to build a multi-department collaborative supervision mechanism from marine fuel life cycle to enhance sulfur oxide monitoring and risk control capabilities. Specific measures of the proposed supervision mechanism include: the joint supervision of compliant fuel supply, the compliant fuel information disclosure platform, a joint law enforcement mechanism for atmospheric pollution, the ability of intelligent ship exhaust monitoring, and the construction of port power infrastructure.

It has been stated that the strategic guideline for the transformation of Ukraine's economy towards climate neutrality is to increase the ambition to reduce the carbon trace of multimodal transportation through the use of an arsenal of effective regulatory and fiscal measures. Problem Statement. The challenge is to find ways to increase the ambition to reduce the carbon footprint of mul timodal transportation in the context of transforming Ukraine's economy to climate neutrality. Purpose. The purpose of this research is to develop scenarios for reducing the carbon footprint of multimodal transportation to ensure the environment preservation and well-being of the future generations. Materials and Methods. The following methods have been used: economic and mathematical modelling on the basis of correlation-regressive analysis, for determining the dependence of greenhouse gas emissions on fuel con sumption in the transport sector, cargo and passenger turnover, GDP, the number of permanent population; de coupling analysis, for estimating the impact of transport on the environment; comparative analysis, for studying the elasticity of greenhouse gas emissions with GDP changes in countries with the length of transport routes close to Ukraine; strategic analysis, for assessing the realism of NDCs2; scenario forecasting, for identifying alternative scenarios of changes in greenhouse gas emissions, provided that the traffic flows increase. Results. For the first time, a mechanism for paying a carbon tax on fuel, which ensures a fair attitude towards environmental pollutants and a reasonable formation of the investment potential of the Decarbonisation Fund. has been proposed. Conclusions. Having chosen the transformation of Ukraine's economy towards climate neutrality as a strategic guideline, the government shall decide to increase the ambition to reduce the carbon footprint of multimodal transportation through the use of an arsenal of effective fiscal measures.

However, excess heat from industry is also recognized as a valuable source with the high potential for utilization. It increases the economic and environmental viability of the system due to the low operation, investment and conventional energy costs. The main goal of this work was to define the effect of the main factors influencing the levelized cost of excess heat. The paper provided the feasibility of excess heat utilization in different district heating configurations, including solar collectors, cogeneration, peak load boilers, heat pumps and heat storages, showing that its overall utilization can be much lower than the expected 100% of the overall availability depending on the configuration. Furthermore, temperature levels of the excess heat source have been considered in the analysis to show changes in levelized cost of excess heat with different temperatures and the necessary preconditions for its utilization.

Rapidly growing demand for these services, combined with long lead times for technology development and long lifetimes of energy infrastructure, make decarbonization of these services both essential and urgent. We examine barriers and opportunities associated with these difficult-to-decarbonize services and processes, including possible technological solutions and research and development priorities. A range of existing technologies could meet future demands for these services and processes without net addition of CO2 to the atmosphere, but their use may depend on a combination of cost reductions via research and innovation, as well as coordinated deployment and integration of operations across currently discrete energy industries.

We give a detailed specification of OPERA's underlying methodology and approach, as well as a description of its multiple applications. The model has been used extensively to formulate strategic policy advice on energy decarbonization and climate change mitigation for the Dutch government, and to perform exploratory studies on the role of specific low-carbon energy technologies in the energy transition of the Netherlands. Based on a reference scenario established through extensive consultation with industry and the public sector, OPERA allows for examining the impact of autonomous technology diffusion and energy efficiency improvement processes, and investigating a broad range of policy interventions that target greenhouse gas emission abatement or air pollution reduction, amongst others. Two characteristics that render OPERA particularly useful are the fact that (1) it covers the entire energy system and all greenhouse gas emissions of the Netherlands, and (2) it possesses a high temporal resolution, including a module for flexibly handling individual time units. The simulation of the complete Dutch energy system and the ability to represent energy supply and demand on an hourly basis allow for making balanced judgments on how to best accommodate large amounts of variable renewable energy production. OPERA is therefore particularly suited for analyzing subjects in the field of system integration, which makes it an ideal tool for assessing the implementation of the energy transition and the establishment of a low-carbon economy. We outline several near-term developments and opportunities for future improvements and refinements of OPERA. One of OPERA's attractive features is that its structure can readily be applied to other countries, notably in Europe, and could thus relatively easily be extended to cover the entire European Union.

A systematic review of motivations, enablers and barriers for consumer engagement with residential demand response	ENERGY POLICY			English	Review						Demand response; Demand-side management; Flexibility; Residential; Consumer engagement	ELECTRICITY DEMAND; RENEWABLE ENERGY; SMART APPLIANCES; SIDE MANAGEMENT; PREFERENCES; INTEGRATION; PERCEPTION; PROGRAMS; POLICY; COST	Demand response is increasingly attracting policy attention. It involves changing electricity demand at different times based on grid conditions, which could help to integrate variable renewable generation and new electric loads associated with decarbonisation. Residential consumers could offer a substantial new source of demandside flexibility. However, while there is considerable evidence that at least some residential users engage with at least some forms of demand response, there is also considerable variation in user engagement. Better understanding this variation could help to predict demand response potential, and to engage and protect consumers participating in demand response. Based on a systematic review of international demand response trials, programmes and surveys, we identify motivations for participation, and barriers and enablers to engagement including familiarity and trust, perceived risk and control, complexity and effort, and consumer characteristics and routines. We then discuss how these factors relate to the features of different demand response products and services. While the complexity of the evidence makes it difficult to draw unequivocal conclusions, the findings of this review could contribute to guide early efforts to deploy residential demand response more widely.

Much of the pollution and energy consumption is attributed to cities, which are expected to increase in size and population in the coming years. It is therefore necessary to develop systems to make them more sustainable and resilient. In this regard, different agendas, strategies, and regulations have been published, such as the 2030 Agenda. The current research carried out a surveillance and foresight process at the European level in the field of the sustainable city, analyzing actions accomplished, ongoing, or forthcoming from 2014 to the present (2020) and coming years. The objective is to identify the potential niches and opportunities for decision making to develop successful projects in this sector. The study concludes that one of the most promoted themes is related to the environment, highlighting nature and biodiversity in cities to improve environmental quality and achieve the decarbonization necessary to fight climate change. Furthermore, society plays an important role, emphasizing the need to promote the population's inclusion and empowerment. It also underlines the promotion of urban regeneration, which should include energy transition and digitalization to create smart cities, with local circular economies.

These require systemic transition in how people live and do business in different local areas and regions within nations. Indeed, in recognition of the climate challenge, many regional and city authorities have set their own net zero targets. What is missing is a grounded principles framework to support what will inevitably be a range of broader public policy actions, which must in turn consider pathways that are not only technically, but economically, socially and politically feasible. Here, we attempt to stimulate discussion on this issue. We do so by making an initial proposition around a set of generic questions that should challenge any decarbonisation action, using the example of carbon capture and storage to illustrate the importance and complexity of ensuring feasibility of actions in a political economy arena. We argue that this gives rise to five fundamental 'Net Zero Principles' around understanding of who really pays and gains, identifying pathways that deliver growing and equitable prosperity, some of which can deliver near-term economic returns, while avoiding outcomes that simply involve 'off-shoring' of emissions, jobs and gross domestic product.

Ch			ESTIMATES OF METHANE EMISSIONS IN THE OIL-AND-GAS INDUSTRY OF UKRAINE: PROBLEMS AND WORLD EXPERIENCE IN THEIR SOLUTION	SCIENCE AND INNOVATION			English	Article						greenhouse gases; oil-and-gas industry; identification of methane emission sources; methane emission estimation; technology		Introduction. Given the possible impact of economy decarbonisation policy decisions on the future of the oil and-gas industry, it is necessary to develop a strategy for its further development, taking into account both carbon dioxide and methane emissions. Problem Statement. IIn recent years, many countries have been making efforts for reducing methane emissions in the oil-and-gas industry, several national and international initiatives have been formed. In Ukraine, not enough attention is paid to this matter. Purpose. The purpose is to analyze the state of monitoring of methane emissions from the oil-and-gas industry of Ukraine and to generalize experience of other countries in this field. Materials and Methods. Analysis of official estimates of methane emissions from the oil-and-gas industry of Ukraine. Review of authoritative literature sources and documents of international organizations on the estimate of methane emissions from the industry, technological and institutional measures for monitoring and verification of these emissions. Results. Comparative analysis of estimates of greenhouse gas emissions in the oil-and-gas industry based on the National GHG Inventory annual reports of the Naftogaz of Ukraine Group has been made. The peculiarities of methane emission sources in the industry and the problems of quantification of its emissions have been considered. Technological means and measures implemented in different countries to solve the problems of methane emissions monitoring have been analyzed. Conclusions. It has been concluded that there is a wide range of available technologies for detection and quantification of methane emissions in the industry. The need to use national coefficients for estimating fugitive emissions from oil-and-gas industry for the National GHG Inventory has been shown. An important factor in reducing methane emissions from the industry shall be government policy that aims at developing and implementing regulatory standards and special economic tools.

However, empirical evidence for absolute decoupling, i.e. decreasing resource use and emissions at the required scale despite continued economic growth, is scarce and scattered across different research streams. In this two-part systematic review, we assess how and to what extent decoupling has been observed and what can be learnt for addressing the sustainability and climate crisis. Based on a transparent approach, we systematically identify and screen more than 11 500 scientific papers, eventually analyzing full texts of 835 empirical studies on the relationship between economic growth (GDP), resource use (materials and energy) and greenhouse gas emissions. Part I of the review examines how decoupling has been investigated across three research streams: energy, materials and energy, and emissions. Part II synthesizes the empirical evidence and policy implications (Haberlet al2020Environ. Res. Lett.15065003). In part I, we examine the topical, temporal and geographical scopes, methods of analysis, institutional networks and prevalent conceptual angles. We find that in this rapidly growing literature, the vast majority of studies-decomposition, 'causality' and Environmental Kuznets Curve analysis-approach the topic from a statistical-econometric point of view, while hardly acknowledging thermodynamic principles on the role of energy and materials for socio-economic activities. A potentially fundamental incompatibility between economic growth and systemic societal changes to address the climate crisis is rarely considered. We conclude that the existing wealth of empirical evidence merits braver conceptual advances than we have seen thus far. Future work should focus on comprehensive multi-indicator long-term analyses, conceptually grounded on the fundamental biophysical basis of socio-economic activities, incorporating the role of global supply chains as well as the wider societal role and preconditions of economic growth.

The suitability of the natural gas infrastructure for this purpose depends on the impact that hydrogen may have on the correct operation of its components and understanding the new flow conditions in the system is essential for this aim. Computational studies can anticipate the expected environment in the pipe system, assessing the readiness of the system. However, the experience on this topic is not extensive enough and deeper understanding is necessary. Here we show a CFD study to simulate the transport of H-2/NG blends in a gas setup with the main characteristics of injection sites and gas pipelines representatives of the transmission gas network. This setup considers a blending station, the pumping and injection procedure, and different pipelines geometries to predict the behavior of various mixtures of H-2/NG. It can be seen how (1) a good mixing is achieved in the blending station after a pipe length equivalent to 20-30 diameters is reached; (2) pumping gas by a piston type compressor shows pulsations in the flow regardless the composition of the blend that can be damped implementing mitigation measurements; and (3) asymmetries in the flow are found when the direction of the fluid changes after section reduction, but 20 diameters downstream of the reduction the flow is fully developed.

It recently published its Environmental Sustainability Strategy 2020-2050 (Network Rail, 2020 [1]), which includes setting Science Based Targets for its Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.In this context, Expedition Engineering has been supporting Network Rail's Technical Authority and Decarbonisation Programme in efforts to reduce the CO2e associated with its construction projects, primarily on those using concrete. This has included developing a Routemap to Net Zero Carbon Concrete, partnering with existing supply chains to decarbonise precast platform components used in high volume, and a feasibility piece focused on enabling significant carbon reductions in the ready-mix supply chain. The work has revealed the current difficulties and potential solutions within the UK concrete industry, as well as the value of supply chain partnering and putting research into practice. This paper summarises a combination of works completed and ongoing, and preliminary proposals under review.The route to Net Zero by 2050 must involve reduction in material quantities through design and construction efficiencies and a shift to using and developing materials with reduced CO2e intensity. In the immediate term this will mean maximising Portland cement replacement and accelerating adoption of current state-of-the-art low carbon technology. In the medium- to longterm it is anticipated that use of calcined clay and limestone as cement replacement will form a key part in the progress to reduce CO2e as the availability of PFA and GGBS reduces. The development of a standalone CO2e Reduction Protocol document is proposed as being a useful mechanism to organise new guidance and requirements and tie in with existing standards and contracts.

Reducing these impacts is crucial, but production-based frameworks of carbon measurement and mitigation-which encompass only a limited part of cities' carbon footprints-are much more developed and widely applied than consumption-based approaches that consider the embedded carbon effectively imported into a city. Frequently, therefore, cities are left blind to the importance of their wider consumption-related climate impacts, while at the same time left lacking effective tools to reduce them. To explore the relevance of these issues, we implement methodologies for assessing production- and consumption-based emissions at the city-level and estimate the associated emissions trajectories for Bristol, a major UK city, from 2000 to 2035. We develop mitigation scenarios targeted at reducing the former, considering potential energy, carbon and financial savings in each case. We then compare these mitigation potentials with local government ambitions and Bristol's consumption-based emissions trajectory. Our results suggest that the city's consumption-based emissions are three times the production-based emissions, largely due to the impacts of imported food and drink. We find that low-carbon investments of circa A 3 pound billion could reduce production-based emissions by 25% in 2035. However, we also find that this represents < 10% of Bristol's forecast consumption-based emissions for 2035 and is approximately equal to the mitigation achievable by eliminating the city's current levels of food waste. Such observations suggest that incorporating consumption-based emission statistics into cities' accounting and decision-making processes could uncover largely unrecognised opportunities for mitigation that are likely to be essential for achieving deep decarbonisation.

As automobiles are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions [1], the technological shift towards vehicle powertrain systems is an attempt to lower problems like emissions of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides [2]. On the other hand, patent data are the most reliable business performance for applied research and development activities when investigating the knowledge domains or the technology evolution (Wand, 1997). Our paper describes a Japanese patents dataset of the vehicle powertrain systems for hybrid electric vehicle (HEV), battery electric vehicle (BEV) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV). In this paper we create a method of bombinating international patent classification (IPC) and keywords to define "green" patents in vehicle powertrains field, using patent data which were applied to Japan Patent Office recorded on EPO's PATSTAT database during 2010 similar to 2019 year. When analyze patents, it is necessary to consider the social situation of each country including language background, we collect patents description documents (abstracts and titles) not only written in English but also in Japanese. Finally, we build a database includes 6025 green patents' description documents and 266 patents' holding firms. With which we then identify 3756 HEV patents, 1716 BEV patents, and 553 FCEV patents. Data about patent holding firms is also appended. The full dataset may be useful to researchers who would like to do further search like natural language processing and machine learning on patent description documents, statistical data analysis for empirical economics.

Bayesian optimization of electrochemical devices for electrons-to-molecules conversions: the case of pulsed CO2 electroreduction	REACTION CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING			English	Article; Early Access							TECHNOECONOMIC ANALYSIS; REDUCTION; COPPER; DESIGN; OXIDATION; ETHYLENE; STABILITY; DISCOVERY; CELL	Electrons-to-molecules conversions have emerged as a route to integrate renewable electricity into chemical production processes and ultimately contribute to the decarbonization of chemistry. The practical implementation of these conversions will depend on the optimization of many electrolyzer design and operating parameters. Bayesian optimization (BO) has been shown to be a robust and efficient method for these types of optimization problems where data may be scarce. Here, we demonstrate the use of BO to improve a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) CO2 electrolyzer, targeting the production of CO through dynamic operation. In a system with intentionally unoptimized components, we first demonstrate the effectiveness of dynamic voltage pulses on CO faradaic efficiency (FE), then utilize BO for 3D and 4D optimization of pulse times and current densities to increase CO partial current density by >64% from the initially tested conditions. The methodology showcased here lays the groundwork for the optimization of other complex electrons-to-molecules conversions that will be required for the electrification of chemical manufacturing.

J	Katris, A; Turner, K				Katris, Antonios; Turner, Karen			Can different approaches to funding household energy efficiency deliver on economic and social policy objectives? ECO and alternatives in the UK	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Economic sustainability; Socialising costs; Computable general equilibrium	EMISSIONS; DEMAND; BROAD; COST	Residential energy efficiency is a core element of the decarbonisation policy in many nations. In the UK, the established approach to enabling efficiency gains through centralised retrofitting programmes involves socialising costs via consumer energy bills through the Energy Company Obligation (ECO). One UK policy concern is whether less affluent households should receive greater access to ECO funding. However, there is a broader concern that the use of constrained public resources should be justified through wider and sustained economic returns emerging. Here, we consider the (centralised) ECO approach to cost recovery alongside alternative (decentralised) approaches to delivering energy efficiency programmes that either pass costs to beneficiary households or fully socialise costs via income tax. We find the key drivers of both household and wider economy outcomes are the absolute levels of resources actually devoted to enabling efficiency gains and household disposable income freed up to power expansionary processes. The latter in particular brings challenges and tradeoffs in terms of meeting both economic performance and social policy objectives, given that resources targeted at higher income households can ultimately free up more real spending ability and sustain greater gains in GDP, employment and household incomes.

Ch			ESTIMATE S OF METHANE EMISSIONS IN THE OIL-AND-GAS INDUSTRY OF UKRAINE: PROBLEM S AND WORLD EXPERIENCE IN THEIR SOLUTION	SCIENCE AND INNOVATION			English	Article						greenhouse gases; oil-and-gas industry; identification of methane emission sources; methane emission estimation; and technology		Introduction. Given the possible impact of economy decarbonisation policy decisions on the future of the oil-and-gas industry, it is necessary to develop a strategy for its further development, taking into account both carbon dioxide and methane emissions. Problem Statement. IIn recent years, many countries have been making efforts for reducing methane emissions in the oil-and-gas industry, several national and international initiatives have been formed. In Ukraine, not enough attention is paid to this matter. Purpose. The purpose is to analyze the state of monitoring of methane emissions from the oil-and-gas industry of Ukraine and to generalize experience of other countries in this field. Materials and Methods. Analysis of official estimates of methane emissions from the oil-and-gas industry of Ukraine. Review of authoritative literature sources and documents of international organizations on the estimate of methane emissions from the industry, technological and institutional measures for monitoring and verification of these emissions. Results. Comparative analysis of estimates of greenhouse gas emissions in the oil-and-gas industry based on the National GHG Inventory annual reports of the Naftogaz of Ukraine Group has been made. The peculiarities of methane emission sources in the industry and the problems of quantification of its emissions have been considered. Technological means and measures implemented in different countries to solve the problems of methane emissions monitoring have been analyzed. Conclusions. It has been concluded that there is a wide range of available technologies for detection and quantification of methane emissions in the industry. The need to use national coefficients for estimating fugitive emissions from oil-and-gas industry for the National GHG Inventory has been shown. An important factor in reducing methane emissions from the industry shall be government policy that aims at developing and implementing regulatory standards and special economic tools.

Renewable energy support policy evaluation: The role of long-term uncertainty in market modelling	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Renewable energy policy; Uncertainty; Electricity market modelling; Generation expansion planning; Quantities vs. prices		Policy makers are tasked with selecting, designing, and implementing policies to support the transition to a sustainable power system. As part of the task, they often turn to models to quantify and compare the options available to them. In this work, we investigate the importance of the approach to representing long-term uncertainty in the modelling used to evaluate different decarbonisation or renewable support policies. We compare six different policies options; a cap on CO2 emissions (as with a cap and trade scheme), a CO2 price, a renewable capacity target, a green certificates scheme, a renewable generation subsidy, and a renewable capital grant. In a case study of a small power system, we find that using common modelling approaches that attempt to capture uncertainty as multiple different independent scenarios (such as scenario analysis or Monte-Carlo simulation) perform poorly at representing the reaction of a competitive electricity market as measured by a stochastic optimisation model. We find that a policy maker using this approach to make decisions could set a policy 55% more restrictive than required to meet their target. Further, we find that a deterministic model that ignores uncertainty can underestimate carbon abatement costs by up to 86%. Incorporating uncertainty as individual scenarios only slightly improves this result and biases the estimated costs between price and quantity based approaches. Modelling scenarios individually underestimates the cost of quantity targeting policies by up to 66% and overestimates the cost of price based policies by up to 4%. Finally, we find that incorporating uncertainty as individual scenarios results in wind being selected as the most cost efficient technology to respond to decarbonisation policies, on average. However, when considering that decision makers must invest under uncertainty, solar capacity is preferable. The results provide a strong case for the use of the stochastic optimisation approach to incorporating long-term uncertainty into electricity market modelling for renewable energy support policy analysis, despite the additional computational burden.

The success of multi-species integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) methods predominantly in East Asia is a clear low cost path to scaling up seaweed cultivation in the broader world that provides for both synergistic sharing of nutrients and reduction in water eutrophication. A number of innovations intended to adapt farming methods to deeper or more exposed coastal waters and semi-automate cultivation steps promise to maintain the viability of farming in higher labour cost countries. Co-location of IMTA/finfish and seaweed farming with grid-connected offshore renewable energy (primarily offshore wind) shows the greatest synergistic benefits for marine space usage, decarbonisation, and nutrient management. Seaweed growth can be accelerated by cycling farm infrastructure between the near surface and nutrient richer depths or upwelling cooler nutrient rich water to sub-surface seaweed crops. Such systems would inevitably require significant increases in infrastructure complexity and costs, jeopardizing their economic viability. Combinations of seaweed and higher value aquaculture products may improve the viability of such novel systems.

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of an Innovative Compact Hybrid Electrical-Thermal Storage System for Residential Buildings in Mediterranean Climate	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						energy storage; heating and cooling system; life cycle assessment (LCA); ReCiPe indicator; global warming potential (GWP) indicator; environmental impact	ENERGY; PCM	The buildings sector is one of the least sustainable activities in the world, accounting for around 40% of the total global energy demand. With the aim to reduce the environmental impact of this sector, the use of renewable energy sources coupled with energy storage systems in buildings has been investigated in recent years. Innovative solutions for cooling, heating, and domestic hot water in buildings can contribute to the buildings' decarbonization by achieving a reduction of building electrical consumption needed to keep comfortable conditions. However, the environmental impact of a new system is not only related to its electrical consumption from the grid, but also to the environmental load produced in the manufacturing and disposal stages of system components. This study investigates the environmental impact of an innovative system proposed for residential buildings in Mediterranean climate through a life cycle assessment. The results show that, due to the complexity of the system, the manufacturing and disposal stages have a high environmental impact, which is not compensated by the reduction of the impact during the operational stage. A parametric study was also performed to investigate the effect of the design of the storage system on the overall system impact.

The real option literature offers a vast amount of models to handle investment decisions in such a context. This exploratory study conducts structured interviews with a number of investors in the Netherlands to understand how CCS investment decisions are actually made. The interviews were based on stylized, but realistic business cases in which important real option characteristics are deliberately embedded. Our objective was to analyze whether these options were recognized and whether the decisions of those investors are in line with real option theory. We find that real option models may predict outcomes more or less adequately at the macro level, but do not (fully) describe the micro level behavior of investors. We develop some tentative recommendations for policymakers who want to promote the private funding of CCS projects and formulate the outline for follow-up research to confirm the preliminary findings of this exploratory study.

These potential harmonic distortion issues could result in significant financial losses. To address this problem, the estimation of harmonic propagation through transmission network with increasing penetration of nonlinear loads, power electronics based renewable generation and control devices is becoming increasingly important. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework of applying sequential artificial neural network (ANN) techniques to estimate individual order harmonic distortions and total harmonic distortions (THD) at unmonitored buses in large uncertain transmission networks based on offline measurements and simulations. This study will contribute to facilitate the standard compliance, reduce the extent of the monitor installation, accelerate the assessment of harmonic performance and mitigation studies, as well as contribute to the forecast of potential harmonic issues in large transmission system.

The recent "Paris Agreement" (COP21) represents a major international attempt to address risk associated with climate change through rapid decarbonisation. The mechanisms for implementation are yet to be determined and, while various large-scale geoengineering projects have been proposed, we argue a better solution may lie in cities. Large-scale green urbanism in cities and their bioregions would offer benefits commensurate to alternative geoengineering proposals, but this integrated approach carries less risk and has additional, multiple, social and economic benefits in addition to a reduction of urban ecological footprint. However, the key to success will require policy writers and city makers to deliver at scale and to high urban sustainability performance benchmarks. To better define urban sustainability performance, we describe three horizons of green urbanism: green design, that seeks to improve upon conventional development; sustainable development, that is the first step toward a net zero impact; and the emerging concept of regenerative urbanism, that enables biosphere repair. Examples of green urbanism exist that utilize technology and design to optimize urban metabolism and deliver net positive sustainability performance. If mainstreamed, regenerative approaches can make urban development a major urban geoengineering force, while simultaneously introducing life-affirming co-benefits to burgeoning cities.

Applying panel data analysis and five parametric specifications to monthly data for the lower 48 states in 1990-2019, we estimate own-price elasticities of residential demand for natural gas in the United States (US). Using results from cross-section dependence (CD) test, panel unit root tests, panel time-series estimators, and rolling-window analysis, we document: (1) the statistically significant (p-value <= 0.05) static own-price elasticity estimates are -0.271 to -0.486, short-run -0.238 to -0.555 and long-run -0.323 to -0.796; (2) these estimates vary by elasticity type, sample period, parametric specification, treatment of CD and assumption of partial adjustment; (3) erroneously ignoring the highly significant (p-value < 0.01) CD shrinks the size of these estimates that vary seasonally, regionally, and nonlinearly over time; and (4) residential natural gas shortage costs decline with the size of own-price elasticity estimates. These findings suggest that achieving deep decarbonization may require strategies that do not rely solely on prices, such as energy efficiency standards and demand-side-management programs. Demand response programs may prove useful for managing natural gas shortages.

As power sector investments between developing countries grow, the climate finance regime should incentivize the decarbonization of these major sources of finance by integrating them as a complement to the commitments of developed nations. The emergence of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, South-South Cooperation Fund and other nascent institutions reveal the fissures that exist in rules and norms surrounding international finance in the power sector. Structuring the climate agreement in Paris to credit qualified finance from the developing world could have several advantages, including: (1) encouraging low-carbon cooperation between developing countries; (2) incentivizing emerging investors to prefer low-carbon investments; and (3) enabling more cost-effective attainment of national and global climate objectives. Failure to coordinate on standards now could hinder low-carbon development in the decades to come.

Here, a new multi-scale approach for the cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides is reported, designed by combining the hydrogen bonding ability, metal-free catalysts and supported ionic liquids on polymers. The use of additive manufacturing (AM) techniques allowed the digital design and rapid fabrication of structured architectures for continuous-flow reactors, which offers potential for process optimization. AM generated catalytic reactors showed higher catalytic activity than similar sized packed bed reactors, when normalised to the amount of catalyst and their surface area. The catalytic activity and stability were maintained over a prolonged period of time (300 h) without loss of activity, and it was demonstrated to efficiently transform a range of epoxide substrates.

How to put such transformative change towards sustainable food production whilst ensuring food security into practice remains a challenge and will require transdisciplinary approaches. Combining expertise from natural- and social sciences as well as industry perspectives, an alternative vision for the future in the marine realm is proposed. This vision includes moving towards aquaculture mainly of low trophic marine (LTM) species. Such shift may enable a blue transformation that can support a sustainable blue economy. It includes a whole new perspective and proactive development of policy-making which considers, among others, the context-specific nature of allocation of marine space and societal acceptance of new developments, over and above the decarbonization of food production, vis a vis reducing regulatory barriers for the industry for LTM whilst acknowledging the complexities of upscaling and outscaling. This needs to be supported by transdisciplinary research co-produced with consumers and wider public, as a blue transformation towards accelerating LTM aquaculture opportunities in a net zero-carbon world can only occur by considering the demands of society.

Detailed microstructure has been characterised using optical microscopy and field emission gun scanning electron microscopy. A newly developed X-ray diffraction method has been employed to dissolve the bainitic/martensitic ferrite phase as two sub-phases of different tetragonal ratios, which provides quantitative analyses of the carbon partitioning between the resultant ferrites and the retained austenite. The results show that, a short-term austempering treatment was in the incubation period of the bainite transformation, which resulted in maximum hardness being equivalent to the oil-quenching treatment. The associated microstructure comprises fine carbide-free martensitic and bainitic ferrites of supersaturated carbon contents as well as carbon-rich retained austenite. In particular, the short-term austempering treatment helped prevent the formation of lengthy martensitic laths as those being found in the microstructure of oil-quenched sample. When the austempering time was increased from 20 to 80 min, progressive decrease of the hardness was associated with the evolution of the microstructure, including progressive coarsening of bainitic ferrite, carbide precipitating inside high-carbon bainitic ferrite and its subsequent decarbonisation.

To this end, various exergy-based and environmental impact indicators are assessed in the light of different utility supply scenarios. The combined exergy and energy integration analysis are used to identify potential improvements related to the decarbonization and mitigation of the process irreversibility. As a result, the exergy efficiencies of the conventional scenario and the integrated plants average 40% and 45%, respectively, whereas the overall CO 2 emission balances vary from 1.97 to -0.07 t CO2 /t Pulp , respectively. Additionally, an incremental economic analysis that envisages future carbon taxation scenarios suggests that only MeOH or DME co-production routes with partial electricity import may economically outperform the conventional kraft pulp mill for moderate carbon taxations. These results highlight the relevance of the electricity import from the Brazilian mix for pushing upwards the share of renewable energy resources in the production of traditionally fossil-based fuels and chemicals.

A short communication to define the overcurrent protection system of the CIGRE European benchmark distribution networks for RES penetration studies	ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Distribution networks; Protection systems; Renewable generation		The use of clean energies in distribution networks is an unstoppable trend which has a significant positive impact on the progressive power system decarbonization. However, it has to be considered that conventional distribution systems have been designed to operate as passive networks. Therefore, a massive penetration of distributed generation may create several operational problems, such as malfunction of the protection systems, which may limit the deployment of this technology. The analysis of these limitations by means of representative benchmark networks is of utmost importance. Most of the proposed benchmark networks proposed so far, however, lack of information about their protection system. To overcome this shortcoming, this letter specifies the protection system of the benchmark European distribution networks proposed by the CIGRE Task Force C06.04.02 for this purpose.

Distributed generation is projected to play a significant role in the new energy system, and energy models are informing how distributed generation can be integrated reliably and economically. In this work, we present an end-to-end computational framework for distributed energy resource (DER) modeling, REopt Lite (TM), which captures the interface of technology, economics, and policy in the energy modeling process. We describe the problem space, the building blocks of the model, the scaling capabilities of the design, the optimization formulation, and the extensibility of the model. We present a framework for accelerating the techno-economic analysis of behind-the-meter distributed energy resources to enable rapid planning and decision-making, thereby enabling greater renewable energy deployment. This computation framework is open-sourced to facilitate transparency, flexibility, and wider collaboration opportunities within the worldwide energy modeling community.

However, the embodied environmental impact associated with food consumption is still under discussion, which demands an in-depth analysis of its upstream environmental impact. Therefore, in this study, we consider Japan as a case study and apply an environmentally extended input-output table to tackle its embodied carbon footprint across sectors and regions. To further investigate the contribution of food transport, we extracted transport-related carbon footprints embodied in Japanese food consumption according to six transport types. The results indicate that 34% of the carbon footprints from Japan's food consumption were induced overseas, mostly being leaked in some Asian and Pacific countries (4536 kilo tonCO(2)eq in China and 4758 kilo tonCO(2)eq in other Asian and Pacific countries' group) and the United States (4444 kilo tonCO(2)eq). The implications of this study reveal the key role of food consumption in Japan's future decarbonization and carbon neutrality, and provide potential mitigation measures to reduce transport emissions from the perspective of food supply chain.

Seemingly inevitable market and policy changes will push economies to transition away from reliance on industries with higher carbon emissions and bring transient economic impacts, especially in regions that are currently heavily reliant on such industries. This situation is not unusual in a global context. To underpin better-informed decisions that enable a smoother economic transition to a low-emissions future, we developed a 'latent economic vulnerability to emissions reduction' (LEVER) index, which maps and explores regions that are more likely to be economically impacted from climate change mitigation. Thus, this paper provides an analysis and discussion of the potential regional implications of a future low-emissions economy, with the analysis contextualised for the state of Queensland, Australia. Given this case study, the economic impacts and future of coal-fired power stations, coal mining and renewable energy are discussed. The LEVER index weighs the risk of high carbon economic exposure against the variability in carbon economic resilience from employment in low-emission sectors across local economies. We find that between 3 and 6 per cent of Queensland regions are assessed as having a very high latent economic vulnerability to increased decarbonisation of industrial activities. To promote a smoother transition, these regions will require targeted investments and strategies to enable their transition towards lower carbon-intensive systems, while maximising economic and social outcomes.

This is an essential input to define efficient public policies and strategy and convince stakeholders to invest in the hydrogen chain value. In order to understand the vision of the main stakeholders of the Brazilian hydrogen economy, a literature and documental analysis, complemented by interviews and questionnaire-based surveys with 32 experts of five categories (companies, governmental entities, research centers, associations, and universities) were performed. The results showed that, in the long-term vision, interviewees highlighted decarbonization as a key strategic advantage for hydrogen economy development in Brazil. Interviewees affirmed that, as Brazil already has a high share of renewable energy in its electricity mix and potential renewable power capacity additions, production of competitive low-cost green hydrogen is possible. On the other hand, the potential of low-carbon hydrogen production from fossil fuels combined with carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) is still a limited technology in the country. Nevertheless, Brazil needs to address challenges such as scaling up, cost reduction, and adoption and sustainable growth of hydrogen-based technologies. A majority of the interviewees foresaw that a well-established Brazilian hydrogen economy would become a reality at medium term (between 6 and 10 years). Opportunities for green hydrogen were highlighted in the cement, mobility, and fertilizer sectors. Nonetheless, a strong difference can be observed among the different categories about the maturity of hydrogen in the national context. While government entities believe in the medium term (6-10 years), companies foresee that technical and economic maturity will be reached in the long term (more than 11 years) In addition, economic, technical, normative, and social barriers were identified. The results show that Brazilian government needs to create a long-term policy framework that could build up confidence in private investment, create market demand with policy interventions, develop standards and regulations to remove obstacles for the market growth and provide enhanced R&D support. If the current initiatives are driven by the interaction with foreign players, a program centered to the synergy with Brazilian energy matrix and long-term economy planning is recommended. In terms of R&D, the creation of a specific funding program can be considered a strong tool to approximate efficiently and rapidly the industry to the academy through the development of ad hoc solutions to develop the market of hydrogen commodities.

However, previous work has investigated its long-term impacts through centralized generation planning models which do not reflect the current deregulated environment. At the same time, existing market-based generation planning models are inherently unable to capture the demand flexibility potential since they neglect time-coupling effects and system reserve requirements in their representation of the electricity market. This paper investigates the long-term impacts of demand flexibility in the deregulated environment, by proposing a time-coupling, bi-level optimization model of a self-interested generation company's investment planning problem, which captures for the first time the energy shifting flexibility of the demand side and the operation of reserve markets with demand side participation. Case studies investigate different cases regarding the flexibility of the demand side and different market design options regarding the allocation of reserve payments. The obtained results demonstrate that, in contrast with previous centralised planning models, the proposed model can capture the dependency of generation investment decisions and the related impacts of demand flexibility on the electricity market design and the subsequent strategic response of the self-interested generation company.

The toll that the process of development takes on the environment and economic activity is evident from the arising concerns about sustaining the industrialization that has happened in the last centuries. The increase in carbon footprint and the large-scale pollution caused by industrialization has led researchers to think of new ways to sustain the developmental activities, whilst simultaneously minimizing the harming effects on the enviroment. Therefore, decarbonization strategies have become an important factor in industrial expansion, along with the invention of new catalytic methods for carrying out non-thermal reactions, energy storage methods and environmental remediation through the removal or breakdown of harmful chemicals released during manufacturing processes. The present article discusses the structural features and photocatalytic applications of a variety of metal oxide-based materials. Moreover, the practical applicability of these materials is also discussed, as well as the transition of production to an industrial scale. Consequently, this study deals with a concise framework to link metal oxide application options within energy, environmental and economic sustainability, exploring the footprint analysis as well.

Closed-loop, off-river pumped hydro energy storage overcomes many of the barriers. Small (square km) upper reservoirs are typically located in hilly country away from rivers, and water is circulated indefinitely between an upper and lower reservoir. GIS analysis of high resolution global digital elevation models was used to determine economically feasible closed-loop scheme locations outside protected and urban areas. This search identified 616,000 potential storage sites with an enormous combined storage potential of 23,000 TWh. This is two orders of magnitude more than required to support large fractions of renewable electricity, allowing flexible site selection. Importantly, the resource is widely distributed to effectively support large-scale solar and wind deployment for electrical grid decarbonization.

This paper describes how those companies with diverse commercial interests but common environmental goals came together to collaborate on solving the challenging problem of improving the economic viability of CO2 emission reduction projects. The weight of evidence suggest a link between CO2 levels in the atmosphere and rising Earth temperature. As a result, BP Amoco and other progressive energy companies are seeking ways to take responsible precautionary steps to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. This must be done While at the same time meeting customers' needs for competitively priced products and delivering value for shareholders. Sustainable businesses want and need to be part of a solution that makes good sense for business and good sense for the environment. Governments are interested in engaging industry to voluntarily reduce their countries total emissions to comply with international Protocols, While promoting economic growth. Capture of CO2 from large combustion sources and sequestration in geologic formations will likely play an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. However, the work undertaken to-date shows that the cost Of CO2 capture is too high to make such projects economically viable. Even in the case where the captured CO2 can be used to increase oil recovery, the income generated from the additional oil production is insufficient to make these projects commercially attractive. The key is to develop new technologies which reduce the cost of capturing the CO2 and safely storing it in the ground. Knowing that Other companies were interested in these same objectives, and that governments were interested in promoting and supporting voluntary actions by industry, BP Amoco believed the best way to develop these technologies would be through a collaborative effort where costs and risks could be broadly shared. A strategic review of the technologies needed to achieve the JIP's goals identified five key areas where further development would be valuable or could lead to breakthroughs: CO2 capture by post combustion methods pre-combustion decarbonization oxygen enriched combustion (oxyfuel) maximization of geologic sequestration assurance of long term storage These five areas form the core technology development program of the HP. Another key aspect of the program is the integration of the technology elements through a comprehensive economic model which will be used to evaluate and compare technologies.											0	3	3	0	0	C S I R O	EAST MELBOURNE	PO BOX 89 (EAST ALBERT ST), EAST MELBOURNE, 3002, AUSTRALIA			0-643-06672-1				2001							248	253						6	Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology	BX21Q					2022-12-14	WOS:000184645800039

This paper offers insights on the net effects of transition to low fossil-based electricity by adapting an input-output (I-O) substitution model. Firstly, it addresses a common challenge with national I-O tables, namely how to isolate figures for inhomogeneous products like 'electricity' and 'gas' aggregated into one sector for a case study of Ireland. Secondly, it applies an extended I-O model to compare the net impacts on energy and non-energy sectors when substituting imported fossil fuels for electricity with renewable resources. Within the framework of the I-O model, for each 1% GHG reduction of the gas substitution scenario, there are increases of 26.2 net jobs and (sic)5.1 m net value-added. These impacts are lower by 73-78% for coal substitution scenarios. Without taking account of the lost jobs and value-added from the economy, the job creations and value-added of renewable electricity would be overestimated by 17%-35% and 25%-50%, respectively. As well as giving insights into the net benefits of renewable electricity, the study provides techniques that could be applied to I-O tables for other jurisdictions to enable improved analysis of energy scenarios.

J	Webb, J; de Silva, HN; Wilson, C				Webb, Jeremy; de Silva, H. Nadeeka; Wilson, Clevo			The future of coal and renewable power generation in Australia: A review of market trends	ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND POLICY			English	Review						Coal and renewable energy; Cost of electricity generation: Market trends; Future of electricity generation; Australia	PHASE-OUT; ENERGY; POLICY	Recent estimates of the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) indicate a watershed moment where market forces have become the foremost driver in the replacement of coal by renewable sources. Current studies indicate an energy market is emerging in which not only new renewable plants are more cost effective than new coal fired power plants (CFPPs), but also the former is becoming more cost effective than existing CFPPS on a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) basis. However, an accelerated retirement of existing CFPPs depends both on the price received by power plants on a time weighted basis and on the total cost of energy which, in addition to the LCOE, takes into account costs of distribution and storage needed to overcome intermittent supply. We use Australia - which is undergoing the world's most rapid decarbonisation of power consumption - as a case study to analyse the economics of this transition and to identify its key drivers. In doing so, we provide an updated estimate of the LCOE for renewable and non-renewable power sources for Australia. We confirm that, currently, the LCOE of both solar PV and wind are substantially below that of coal. It is pointed out that LCOEs are an imperfect metric to gauge the rate of transition which will equally depend on total costs of energy and the prices received by energy providers. However, accounting for total costs (most importantly the cost of intermittency and distribution) we show that, combined with other types of non CFPP storage, the time weighted average price received for renewable power is now above that of CFPPs. In Australia, that is being reflected in purchasing power agreements and auction prices for current and future commercial solar and wind projects. Taking into account the strong and continuing downward trajectory of renewables' total costs we find that a market forces driven further acceleration of the retirement of Australian CFPPs could occur if Government policy does not intervene.

The Project comprises a CO2-pipeline infrastructure in the North Sea capable of transporting more than 30 million tonnes CO2 per year (mtCO2/yr). The CO2 will initially be captured from on-shore coal-fired power plants in the UK and Denmark, and used commercially for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) in the maturing oil reservoirs in the North Sea. The scope of the CENS Project entails not inly collaboration between the CO2-producers, transporters and users, but also the host countries. Only when these are active participants does the project reveal a 'win-win-won' situation for all stakeholders, including host governments. The CENS Economic Models (CEM) shows that during a 25-year "economic" lifetime, the project could produce 2.1 billion barrels of incremental oil obtained while sequestering 680 mt CO2 in recognised secure depositories. Assuming price of oil at $20 /bbl then the net cost for CO2-capture and sequestration is less than $1.50 per tonne-this represents one of the cheapest options available to the host nations for CO2-emission reductions. We do not for the time being attribute any value to the CO2-credits that may also be generated within the project. In this paper we briefly elaborate on some of the macroeconomic benefits that the project can produce, including increased tax income, energy security, improved oil recovery, technology development, reduced CO2-emissions, capital investment and jobs. We also indirectly infer some longer-term benefits of a CO2-infrastructure whereby Northern Europe may be in a position to decarbonise existing CO2-emissions during the next half century using ageing oil and gas reservoirs. Furthermore we perceive an accelerated commercial route towards a "hydrogen economy'-initially based on decarbonisation of fossil fuels [1] that can be supplemented by new-renewable hydrogen production, as these become commercially developed.

A scenario analysis based on system dynamics approach	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Carbon intensity; System dynamics model; Carbon tax policy; New energy policy; Scenario analysis	MODEL; MITIGATION; IMPACTS; DECARBONISATION; CONSUMPTION; ECONOMY; TAX	Since Chinese government put a target to decrease carbon intensity 40-45% in 2020 than that of 2005, a series of emission mitigation measures has been implemented. Against this backdrop, we established a system dynamics model to investigate the energy consumption, CO2 emission and mitigation options in China. The results show that the carbon intensity will reduce by 22.68%, 26.84%, 43.77%, and 46.65% in BaU (Business as usual), NEP (New energy policy), CTP (Carbon tax policy) and IP (Integrated policy) scenarios in 2020 compared with 2005. Obviously, Chinese government can accomplish the target under CTP and IP scenarios. Moreover, the "inflection point" in CTP and IP scenarios reveals the decision-making process between tax burden and emission reduction behavior. A brief analysis of interactive effect is accomplished by equilibrium theory and simulation results. It shows that the interactive effect of two policies, which act on the same object with same action direction, is weaker than the aggregation of two separated effects, whereas it is larger than any individual effect. In a nutshell, these findings are helpful for policymakers to optimize their policy decision -making to cut CO2 emissions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Moreover, solar energy forecasting plays an essential role in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and conserving energy for future use. This study conducted a bibliometric analysis to assess solar energy forecasting research studies evolution at the continental (Africa) and southern Africa levels. Key aspects of analysis included (i) scientific research trends, (ii) nature of collaboration networks, (iii) co-occurrence of keywords and (iv) emerging themes in solar energy forecasting over the last two decades, between the years 2000-2021. The results indicate that solar energy forecasting research has, on average, expanded by 6.4% and 3.3% in Africa and southern Africa, respectively. Based on the study context, solar energy forecasting research only gained momentum in 2015, peaking in 2019, but it is generally still subtle. The scientific mapping illustrated that only South Africa ranks among the leading countries that have produced high numbers of published documents and also leads in contributions to the research area in both Africa and southern Africa. Three emerging topics were identified from the thematic map analysis-namely, "solar irradiance", "artificial intelligence" and "clear sky", which implies that researchers are paying attention to solar irradiance, using modelling techniques that incorporate machine learning techniques. Overall, this study contributes to scientific information on the potential bankability of renewable energy projects that could assist power utilities, governments and policymakers in Africa to enforce the green economy through accelerated decarbonisation of the energy systems and building relationships with developed countries for support and better transitioning to solar energy. From a Water-Energy-Food nexus perspective, the results of this work could assist the scientific community in Africa to take advantage of the inherent interconnectedness of water, energy and food resources, whilst also advancing the use of integrated solutions to shape the focus of solar energy research into a more systems thinking and transdisciplinary approach involving the interconnected primary resources and stakeholders pursuit of the Sustainable Development Goals.

Within this strategic framework, the renewable energy development target plays a key role. This renewable energy deployment must be translated into national and European Union realities through specific political decisions. The econometric analysis techniques have the capacity to represent, in a mathematical and objective way, the system of relations comprising the economic, technical, and political factors that contribute to the deployment of renewable energy, and the impact that such an investment in renewable energy has at an economic, environmental, and social level. Therefore, econometric studies have a high potential to support policymakers who have to translate the guidelines of the strategic plan for renewable energy deployment into concrete policies. This article analyzed the capacity of the econometric literature on renewable energy development to provide this support, by means of a bibliometric study carried out on a sample of 153 documents related to 1329 keywords. The results show that, in general, there is a large literature based on econometric methodology to support the different renewable energy guidelines provided by the European Union 2020-2030 climate and energy strategic framework.

J	Nkrumah, B				Nkrumah, Bright			Courting emissions: climate adjudication and South Africa's youth	ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Climate litigation; Rights; South Africa; Ubuntu; Youth		Background The urgency to pursue sustainable consumption or use energy in a manner that does not negatively impact the environment has become an important theme in recent times. As a major fluctuation in the atmosphere, climate change will be one of the major challenges faced by youth. As a result, there have been a growing number of young South Africans advocating for environmental justice. Surprisingly, their effort has not yielded the expected result as the country continues to emit a high amount of greenhouse gases. The notion of youth may be construed as those between the ages of 15 and 24. The age bracket suggests that the adult lives of this population will be shaped by environmental crises such as famines, vector-borne diseases, and hikes in commodity prices which may impinge on their basic rights to life, health, and property. This development triggers an ancient discourse, what role can youth play towards decarbonization? In other words, which effective avenue could be used by young people for capping emissions? Methods An analysis of South Africa's energy policy documents relevant to sustainability was conducted through the application of desktop research. We use (inter)national instruments and jurisprudence to understand how a state structure, like the judiciary, could nudge the executive to cap rising green gas emissions. South Africa is used as a case study because of its over-reliance on coal for electricity, and how young people could use the existing legal framework to cap rising emissions. Drawing from existing literature, the paper interrogates the lack of activism around climate litigation and under what conditions this pattern could be reversed in South Africa. Results The paper found that while litigation has an important role to play in mitigating climate change, it ought to be complemented with other forms of advocacy. Conclusions The study concludes that given the government's perceived slow steps towards shifting from coal to renewables, youth (who will bear the brunt of high emissions) ought to use both courtrooms and advocacy to trigger political action.

It is generally assumed that this decarbonization effect requires the liberalization of electricity markets. However, amongst the more than 40 jurisdictions throughout the world that are now implementing, planning or considering an ETS to decarbonize electricity supply, few have adopted the electricity market liberalization textbook model. Economic agents are constrained in how they can respond to an ETS through various forms of electricity market regulation but, given the political sensitivity of electricity market reform and the urgency to decarbonize the electricity sector, it is unrealistic to advocate liberalization as a prerequisite to the introduction of an ETS. Building from regulatory theory on the design of electricity and environmental markets, we develop a conceptual framework to understand the interaction between ETS and electricity market regulation under different regulatory settings. Our analysis challenges the general assumption that the introduction of an ETS depends on electricity market liberalization. We argue that the ETS can be adjusted to the electricity market reality of many jurisdictions where governments limit price discovery, restrict price pass-through or place constraints on investment decisions, and discuss regulatory alternatives to address the efficiency losses that may emerge from specific forms of power sector regulation. Key policy insights Although an ETS will be most effective when it is implemented within a liberalized and competitive electricity market, it can also be introduced in a regulated electricity market environment, albeit with some efficiency losses. Where an ETS is implemented under power sector regulation, it is important to understand where barriers to mitigation exist, how much mitigation potential will be lost, and which other policies can target these areas of the economy. A proportion of the efficiency loss might be restored through innovative emissions trading policy design that overcomes the barriers to mitigation put in place through power sector regulation. This is a topic that deserves more academic research.

Carbon and environmental footprinting of low carbon UK electricity futures to 2050	ENERGY			English	Article						Carbon footprints; Environmental footprints; Electricity futures; Energy systems analysis; Sustainability; United Kingdom	ENERGY	Electricity generation contributes a large proportion of the total greenhouse gas emissions in the United Kingdom (UK), due to the predominant use of fossil fuel (coal and natural gas) combustion for this purpose. A range of future UK energy scenarios has been employed to determine their resulting environmental and carbon footprints. Methodologies have been established to calculate these footprints for the UK electricity supply industry on both a historic timescale and in accordance with the three selected scenarios. The latter scenarios, developed by the UK SUPERGEN Consortium on 'Highly Distributed Power Systems' (HDPS), were characterised as 'Business As Usual' (BAU), 'Low Carbon' (LC) and 'Deep Green' (DG) futures, and yielded possible electricity demands out to 2050. It was found that the environmental footprint of the current power network is 41 million (M) global hectares (gha). If future trends follow a 'Business As Usual' scenario, then this footprint is observed to fall to about 25 Mgha in 2050. The LC scenario implies an extensive penetration of micro-generators in the home to satisfy heat and power demands. However, these energy requirements are minimised by way of improved insulation of the building fabric and other demand reduction measures. In contrast, the DG scenario presupposes a network where centralised renewable energy technologies - mainly large-scale onshore and offshore wind turbines - have an important role in the power generation. However, both the LC and DG scenarios were found to lead to footprints of less than 4 Mgha by 2050. These latter two scenarios were found to give rise to quite similar trajectories over the period 2010-2050. They are therefore more likely to reflect an effective transition pathway in terms of meeting the 2050 UK CO2 reduction targets associated with decarbonisation of its power network. However, this appears unlikely to be achieved by 2030-2040 as advocated by the UK Government's advisory Committee on Climate Change in order to meet overall national carbon reduction targets.

Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions for Climate Stabilization: Framing Regional Options	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							CARBON; TECHNOLOGIES; MANAGEMENT; IMPACTS; STORAGE; COSTS; POWER	The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has stated that stabilizing atmospheric CO2 concentrations will require reduction of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by as much as 80% by 2050. Subnational efforts to cut emissions will inform policy development nationally and globally. We projected GHG mitigation strategies for Minnesota, which has adopted a strategic goal of 80% emissions reduction by 2050. A portfolio of conservation strategies, including electricity conservation, increased vehicle fleet fuel efficiency, and reduced vehicle miles traveled, is likely the most cost-effective option for Minnesota and could reduce emissions by 18% below 2005 levels. An 80% GHG reduction would require complete decarbonization of the electricity and transportation sectors, combined with carbon capture and sequestration at power plants, or deep cuts in other relatively more intransigent GHG-emitting sectors. In order to achieve ambitious GHG reduction goals, policyrnakers should promote aggressive conservation efforts, which would probably have negative net costs, while phasing in alternative fuels to replace coal and motor gasoline over the long-term.

Heavy vehicles are poised to potentially be one of the greatest beneficiaries due to their high operating costs. Here a facility location problem approach is adopted to analyze a sample of deidentified truck trip data, providing initial insights into charging network configurations that could support a short-haul electric truck fleet using the case study of South East Queensland. The charging network scenarios include up to 10 optimally-located public sites. The results suggest that a relatively modest public charging network should be sufficient to support the majority of short-haul electric trucks operating in similar regions internationally, in line with other studies that have found that the majority of short-haul electric truck charging is likely to be carried out at depots. Additionally, in outlining limitations of this study, we highlight the need for greater cooperation between researchers, policy-makers and industry to secure access to high-resolution truck trip data to more accurately plan regional charging networks, and freight decarbonization more broadly.

Most transport means operate using fossil fuels, creating the urgent need for a rapid transformation of the sector. In this research, we examine the transport systems of Norway and Canada, two countries with similar shares of greenhouse gas emissions from transport and powerful oil industries operating within their boundaries. Our socio-technical analysis, based on the Sectoral Innovation Systems approach, attempts to identify the elements enabling Norway to become one of the leaders in the diffusion of electric vehicles, as well as the differences pacing down progress in Canada. By utilising the System Failure framework to compare the two systems, bottlenecks hindering the decarbonisation of the two transport systems are identified. Results indicate that the effectiveness of Norway's policy is exaggerated and has led to recent spillover effects towards green shipping. The activity of oil companies, regional and federal legislative disputes in Canada and the lack of sincere efforts from system actors to address challenges lead to non-drastic greenhouse gas emission reductions, despite significant policy efforts from both countries. Insights into the effectiveness of previously implemented policies and the evolution of the two sectoral systems can help draw lessons towards sustainable transport.

At the individual level however, adaptation and mitigation activities are undertaken together as part of the management of risk and resources. We propose that a useful starting point to develop a national climate policy is to understand what societal response might mean in practice. First we frame the set of responses at the national policy level as a trade off between investment in the development and diffusion of new technology, and investment in encouraging and enabling society to change its behaviour and or adopt the new technology. We argue that these are the pertinent trade-offs, rather than those usually posited between climate change mitigation and adaptation. The preference for a policy response that focuses more on technological innovation rather than one that focuses on changing social behaviour will be influenced by the capacity of different societies to change their greenhouse gas emissions; by perceived vulnerability to climate impacts; and by capacity to modify social behaviour and physical environment. Starting with this complete vision of response options should enable policy makers to re-evaluate the risk environment and the set of response options available to them. From here, policy makers should consider who is responsible for making climate response decisions and when actions should be taken. Institutional arrangements dictate social and political acceptability of different policies, they structure worldviews, and they determine the provision of resources for investment in technological innovation and social change. The importance of focussing on the timing of the response is emphasised to maximise the potential for adjustments through social learning and institutional change at different policy scales. We argue that the ability to respond to climate change is both enabled and constrained by social and technological conditions. The ability of society to respond to climate change and the need for technological change for both decarbonisation and for dealing with surprise in general, are central to concepts of sustainable development.

This has led to increased need for introduction of decarbonization policies, use of sustainable resources and development of sustainable cities. Section 431 of EISA 2007 increased the federal energy reduction goal from 2% per year to 3% per year, resulting in 30% greater efficiency by 2015. Executive Order 13693 adopted new reduction targets for years after 2015, requiting federal buildings to achieve a 2.5% reduction in consumption annually. Directive 2012/ 27 / EU of the EU on energy ecieng it is defined that as from 2014 3% of the public buildings owned and occupied by its central government should be renovated each year to meet at least the minimum energy performance requirements. In order to predict influence of the future energy efficiency measures on the efficieng of the existing DH systems, district heating planning tool was used for evaluation of the particular DH system. At the output tool provides nine efficiency and balance indicators with the recommended permissible limits for the evaluation of DH system development scenarios. The tool validation is based on the results of comprehensive research of already renovated renovated buildings. As a result of complex renovation decrease in thermal energy consumption can be achieved from 35% to 50% (average 42.3%). Consistent simulations of the proposed future development scenarios for a particular DH system with different building renovation rates of 3%, 5%, and 7% have shown natural reduction in thermal energy consumption in a 15 : year perspective by 13.5%, 22.5% and 30%.

Risk aversion in multilevel electricity market models with different congestion pricing regimes	ENERGY ECONOMICS			English	Article						Risk aversion; Zonal pricing; Investment; Electricity markets; Stochastic programming	POWER-GENERATION; TRANSMISSION; INVESTMENT; EXPANSION; EQUILIBRIUM; NETWORK; OPTIMIZATION; FLEXIBILITY; UNCERTAINTY; SYSTEMS	Due to ongoing efforts for decarbonization, electricity markets worldwide are undergoing fundamental transitions, which result in increased uncertainty for all market participants. Against this background, we investigate the impact of risk aversion on investment and market operation in markets with different congestion pricing regimes and multi-level decision making. We develop a stochastic multi-level equilibrium model with risk-averse agents, which includes investment in transmission and generation capacity, market operation, and redispatch. The model can incorporate perfect, as well as imperfect locational price signals and different upper-level expectations about lower-level risk aversion. We apply our model to a stylized two-node example and compare the effects of risk aversion in a system with zonal and nodal pricing, respectively. Our results show that the effect of risk aversion is more pronounced in a market with nodal pricing, compared to a market with imperfect locational price signals. Furthermore, transmission planners that are ignorant about risk aversion of generation companies can induce substantial additional costs, especially in a nodal pricing market.

CARBON EMISSIONS FROM CONTAINER SHIPPING: AN ANALYSIS OF NEW EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT ECONOMICS			English	Article						green shipping; carbon emissions; container vessels; trade routes	SPEED; TRANSPORTATION; REDUCTION; SHIPS	In the last decade researchers have been looking at ways of reducing the carbon intensity of shipping operations that globally account for approximately 3 % of world carbon emissions. As a result of regulation and firms' efforts to innovate, the maritime sector has introduced new technologies and practices such as slow steaming which have contributed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the atmosphere. The impact of technological and operational developments on global GHG emissions is difficult to assess, however, without empirical evidence. So far such evidence has been only partially available and most of the data sources used in the literature have been compiled for different purposes or are based on single firm case studies. This paper reports the results of an analysis of a fuel consumption database compiled by the BSR Clean Cargo Working Group (CCWG) with the specific purpose of benchmarking and collecting emission data and comprising 2,300 container ship voyages (reporting year 2013, data for 2012). This analysis has examined the effect of technical and operational parameters on these vessels' fuel consumption and emissions and is the first to be performed on the dataset and in general on self-reported data across multiple companies. In 2012, carriers in the CCWG accounted for approximately 65% of total world deep-sea container traffic. The paper outlines an econometric model that regresses carbon emissions from container shipping on particular trade routes against a range of independent variables, such as vessel age, size and average speed. The paper results indicate that significant differences exist among carriers both in terms of energy efficiency and carbon intensity. The analysis also suggests that while the emission profiles of some trade routes have remained relatively stable in recent years, others have witnessed an increase in emissions mainly as a result of a concentration of container flows. By improving our understanding of the determinants of carbon emissions from container shipping, this research should help shipping lines develop carbon-reduction plans and governments to devise appropriate policies to incentivise the decarbonisation of the maritime sector.

Data for the modelling of the future power system with a high share of variable renewable energy	DATA IN BRIEF			English	Article; Data Paper						Renewable energies; Spain; Power system model; Power generation; Inertia		Energy and power system models have become necessary tools that provide challenges and technical and economic solutions for integrating high shares of Variable Renewable Energy. Models are focused on analysing strategies of power systems to achieve their decarbonisation targets. The data presented in this paper includes the model algorithm, inputs, equations, modelling assumptions, supplementary materials, and results of the simulations supporting the research article titled "Facing the high share of variable renewable energy in the power system: flexibility and stability requirements". The analysis is based on data from the system operator of one of the European Union member states (Spain). The developed model allows making projections and calculations to obtain the power generation of each technology, the international interconnections, inertia, emissions, system costs and flexibility requirements of new technologies. These data can be used for energy policy development or decision making on power capacity and the balancing needs of the future power system. (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

High-Temperature Heat Pumps (HTHPs) are being investigated as a feasible energy conversion technology alternative to traditional fossil fuel boilers. This paper presents the first experimental results of an HTHP prototype equipped with a modified scroll compressor and internal heat exchanger (IHX). The elements of the main and secondary circuits are presented, as well as the test methodology and heat balances are exposed. The tests have been performed using HFC-245fa at heat source temperatures between 60 and 80 degrees C, and heat sink temperatures between 90 and 140 degrees C. The heating capacity and coefficient of performance (COP) varied between 10.9 and 17.5 kW and between 2.23 and 3.41, respectively. An exergetic analysis indicated that the expansion valve was the component with the worst second law efficiency and the compressor presented the highest potential improvement over the other cycle components. A computational analysis of low global warming potential (GWP) refrigerant alternatives was carried out, which confirmed the benefits of using an internal heat exchanger (IHX) and the good performances of the low-GWP refrigerants: HCFO-1224yd(Z), HCFO-1233zd(E), and HFO-1336mzz(Z). Finally, we proved that the proposed system can save up to 57% of the equivalent CO2 emissions of a natural gas boiler. This paper provides a reference for the high-temperature heat pump recovery of the low-grade waste heat from industrial energy processes.

The stochastic nature of charging demand and renewable generation requires intelligent charging driven by predictions of charging behaviour. The conventional prediction models of charging behaviour usually minimise the quadratic loss function. Moreover, the adequacy of predictions is almost solely evaluated by accuracy measures, disregarding the consequences of prediction losses in an application context. Here, we study the role of asymmetric prediction losses which enable balancing the over -and under-predictions and adjust predictions to smart charging algorithms. Using the main classes of machine learning methods, we trained prediction models of the connection duration and compared their performance for various asymmetries of the loss function. In addition, we proposed a methodological approach to quantify the consequences of prediction losses on the performance of selected archetypal smart charging schemes. In concrete situations, we demonstrated that an appropriately selected degree of the loss function asymmetry is crucial as it almost doubles the price range where the smart charging is beneficial, and increases the extent to which the charging demand is satisfied up to 40%. Additionally, the proposed methods improve charging fairness since the distribution of unmet charging demand across vehicles becomes more homogeneous.

This crisis is driven significantly by the global food system. It has been increasing over recent years, yet food systems are essential in upholding food and nutrition security. This study proposed a novel method for enumerating national contributions to the cessation of the climate crisis by approximating nations' aggregate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from food systems, within the equitable and sustainable planetary boundaries of climate change. This study included 221 nations, which were grouped as per their human development index (HDI) categories, income groups, and continental locations. During 1990-2018, the annual fair share, overshoot of emissions, and collective historical responsibility in the world of each country were assessed. There was a 22.52% increase in overshooting of GHG emissions from the global food system, starting in 1990. A group of 15 countries, including Brazil, China, Indonesia, and the U.S.A., were responsible for >67% of global overshoot. The primary liability is borne by countries with upper-, middle-, and high-income economies, and high to very-high HDI groups, as well as Asia and South America. Countries such as India, China, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and others have steadily increased their share of responsibility over the last 28 years. More than 76% of countries in the world, mostly from Africa, Europe, and Asia, proved to be absolute overshooters. After contextualising the study's findings, the global food system's decarbonization and its limits were discussed; some recommendations for prospective research were also offered. It appears that academics, governments, and policymakers should start concentrating more on reshaping and redesigning the global food system to be climate-friendly (i.e., a carbon-neutral food system), whilst being able to fairly allocate food and nutrition security to achieve long-term Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2).

J	de Santoli, L; Lo Basso, G; Bruschi, D				de Santoli, Livio; Lo Basso, Gianluigi; Bruschi, Daniele			A small scale H(2)NG production plant in Italy: Techno-economic feasibility analysis and costs associated with carbon avoidance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY			English	Article						Renewable hydrogen; Hydrogen-natural gas blends; H(2)NG; CO2 emissions avoidance; Economic analysis; HOMER	HYDROGEN-PRODUCTION; ENERGY MANAGEMENT; NATURAL-GAS; ECONOMY; EMISSIONS	Energy conversion from hydrogen represents a viable contribution to sustainable development. For this reason several authors have investigated clean hydrogen production and its end uses. One end use is a hydrogen storage system with a fuel cell to mitigate grid instabilities inherent to renewable power generation or intermittent reactive loads. Another end use is burning hydrogen in internal combustion engines for motive transport or remote power generation. Blending hydrogen with traditional hydrocarbon fuels is also possible. The aim of this paper is to assess the opportunity for realizing a small-scale renewable hydro methane production system in Italy. The system is completely integrated in an electrical and thermal smart grid. For this reason, a techno-economic feasibility analysis on hybrid systems was carried out to quantify the carbon avoidance cost associated with blended hydrogen fuels. Twelve different scenarios were simulated with the HOMER software and the optimal system configuration was identified by applying the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) as evaluation criterion. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was applied to explore potential fiscal policy scenarios. The simulation results show that the lowest LCOH (8.041 (sic)/kg) was achieved with a 5 Nm(3) electrolyser capability (operating for about 4000 h/yr) and a grid connected 160 kW(P) PV array when hydrogen was produced only during the winter season. Instead considering the same operating hours and modifying the hydrogen production daily and monthly profile (i.e. hydrogen production from May to September) the best results were obtained (LCOH = 0 (sic)/kg). An analysis of carbon avoidance costs showed the optimal hydrogen mixture of approximately 23% by volume to provide the best economic and environmental trade-off. Finally, if the hydrogen cost is equal to 1.5587 (sic)/kg a null over price for decarbonisation is achievable. To obtain this result a dedicated incentive scheme to encourage the hydrogen production should be developed by Italian Government. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

J	Turk, JK; Reay, DS; Haszeldine, RS				Turk, Jeremy K.; Reay, David S.; Haszeldine, R. Stuart			UK grid electricity carbon intensity can be reduced by enhanced oil recovery with CO2 sequestration	CARBON MANAGEMENT			English	Article						carbon capture and storage; enhanced oil recovery; life-cycle analysis; gas-fueled power plants; CO2 utilization and storage market	LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; CAPTURE; STORAGE; COST	Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) using CO2 coupled with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) can potentially accelerate CO2 storage investment through creation of a large commercial market for EOR . This article assesses how coupled a CCS-EOR scenario might contribute to decarbonization of UK grid electricity. Progressive introduction of 11 CCS-to-EOR gas-power plant projects from 2020 is estimated to store 52 Mt CO2 yr(-1) from 2030. These 11 projects produce extra revenue of 1100MM bbls of taxable EOR oil from 2020 to 2049. After each 20-year EOR project ceases, its infrastructure is paid for, and has many years of life. UK climate change targets would necessitate continued CO2 storage at low cost. Considering all greenhouse gas emissions - from power generation, CCS-EOR operations, and oil production and combustion - this project suite emits an estimated 940-1068 Mt CO(2)e from 2020 to 2049, while storing 1358 Mt CO2. The total average electricity grid factor in the UK reduces to 90-142kg CO(2)e MWh(-1), with gas generating 132 TWh yr(-1). This life-cycle analysis (LCA) is unusual in linking oil production and combustion with CCS and gas-fueled electricity, yet provides a net carbon reduction, and progressively reduces net oil combustion emissions beyond 2040.

We analyzed production pathways for (1) Fischer-Tropsch diesel from biomass and cofeeding biomass with natural gas or coal, (2) renewable diesel via hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids from yellow grease and cofeeding yellow grease with heavy oil, and (3) bio-oil via fast pyrolysis of low-ash woody feedstock. We also developed a new version of the Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation (GREET) marine fuel module for the estimation of life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) and criteria air pollutant (CAP) emissions of conventional and biobased marine fuels. The alternative fuels considered have a minimum fuel selling price between 2.36 and 4.58 $/heavy fuel oil gallon equivalent (HFOGE), and all exhibit improved life-cycle GHG emissions compared to heavy fuel oil (HFO), with reductions ranging from 40 to 93%. The alternative fuels also exhibit reductions in sulfur oxides and particulate matter emissions. Additionally, when compared with marine gas oil and liquified natural gas, they perform favorably across most emission categories except for cases where carbon and sulfur emissions are increased by the cofed fossil feedstocks. The pyrolysis bio-oil offers the most promising marginal CO2 abatement cost at less than $100/tonne CO(2)e for HFO prices >$1.09/HFOGE followed by Fischer-Tropsch diesel from biomass and natural gas pathways, which fall below $100/tonne CO(2)e for HFO prices >$2.25/HFOGE. Pathways that cofeed fossil feedstocks with biomass do not perform as well for marginal CO2 abatement cost, particularly at low HFO prices. This study indicates that biofuels could be a cost-effective means of reducing GHG, sulfur oxide, and particulate matter emissions from the maritime shipping industry and that cofeeding biomass with natural gas could be a practical approach to smooth a transition to biofuels by reducing alternative fuel costs while still lowering GHG emissions, although marginal CO2 abatement costs are less favorable for the fossil cofeed pathways.

J	Curran, G				Curran, Giorel			Divestment, energy incumbency and the global political economy of energy transition: the case of Adani's Carmichael mine in Australia	CLIMATE POLICY			English	Article						Divestment; climate politics; energy policy; energy regime incumbency; Adani Carmichael mine	FOSSIL-FUEL DIVESTMENT; SOCIAL LICENSE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COAL; GOVERNANCE; POLICIES; JUSTICE; REGIMES	Divestment campaigners are relatively new entrants to climate activism but have already made important contributions to the efforts of their climate movement allies. Through their strategy of directly targeting those financial actors responsible for the funding of fossil fuel production, they now play an increasingly key role in the decarbonization project. Despite these efforts divestment faces significant constraints. These constraints are illustrated in our study of the anti-Carmichael mine campaign in Australia. While the persistent campaign of divestment actors helped convince many financiers to decline funding the mine, in the end the mine was approved to proceed. This is no surprise, given the on-going resilience of fossil fuel financing and of the energy regime that sustains it. To understand the key elements of this resilience, and how it impacts divestment strategy, this paper situates divestment more directly in the contemporary globalized political economy and in the related politics of energy regime incumbency. The findings apply both to our specific Australian case and to the politics of divestment more broadly. Policy Insights The continued funding of fossil fuel production highlights the limitations of national and international climate policy negotiations to achieve significant change. Divestment addresses these policy disappointments through its direct targeting of the financing of fossil fuel production. The Carmichael coal mining case in Australia highlights the constraints climate actors confront in shifting climate policy decision-making away from incumbent energy regime actors - both financial and political. The case's trajectory raises both national and global climate policy implications, particularly the on-going resilience of fossil fuel financing and the networks and practices that sustain it.

Implementing microfluidics for H2 production reduces the assortment of components required for traditional water electrolyzer, as laminar flow is prevalent in microchannels, eliminating the need for a membrane. Here we demonstrate microfluidic electrolysis cells (microECs) produced by additive manufacturing, which enables rapid and reproducible prototyping. The microEC consisted of three parallel microchannels encompassing a pair of porous flow-through electrodes. The design allows the H2 and O2 gases to be transported through the porous electrodes and collected in outer channels with negligible cross-over between gases and high H2 yield. The space-time yield of H2 increased significantly in the microEC owing to rapid mass transfer in the porous elec-trodes and microchannel. The electrolyte velocity is optimized (0.16 - 0.34 m s- 1) to attain minimum charge and mass transfer resistances while averting gas product intermixing in membraneless operation. The microEC exhibited a current density of 747 mA cm-2 at 2.5 V and 0.34 m s-1 electrolyte velocity. The H2 and O2 volu-metric collection efficiency is 99.88 % and 98.35 %, respectively, with 99.35 % energy conversion efficiency based on 1 mm interelectrode distance. Accelerated stress testing on the microEC was performed by imposing a dynamic current stressor with periodic shutdown to mimic power supply from renewable energy sources. The degradation mechanism was identified from the analysis of electrochemical and physicochemical characterizations.

To achieve these goals, green hydrogen that can be produced from the electrolysis of water is an important key solution to tackle global decarbonization. Consequently, in recent years there is an increase in interest towards green hydrogen production through the electrolysis process for large-scale implementation of renewable energybased power plants and other industrial, and transportation applications. The main objective of this study was to provide a comprehensive review of various green hydrogen production technologies especially on water electrolysis. In this review, various water electrolysis technologies and their techno-commercial prospects including hydrogen production cost, along with recent developments in electrode materials, and their challenges were summarized. Further some of the most successful results also were described. Moreover this review aims to identify the gaps in water electrolysis research and development towards the techno-commercial perspective. In addition, some of the commercial electrolyzer performances and their limitations also were described along with possible solutions for cost-effective hydrogen production Finally, we outlined our ideas, and possible solutions for driving cost-effective green hydrogen production for commercial applications. This information will provide future research directions and a road map for the development/implementation of commercially viable green hydrogen projects. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

HAp printable inks with controlled nanoporosity and rheological properties have been successfully achieved by incorporating Pluronic hydrogel. Nanoporous scaffolds with good mechanical properties, as demonstrated by means of the nanoindentation technique, have been obtained by a sintering treatment and the posterior thermally induced polarization process. Their catalytic activity has been evaluated by considering three different key reactions (all in the presence of liquid water): (1) the synthesis of amino acids from gas mixtures of N-2, CO2, and CH4; (2) the production of ethanol from gas mixtures of CO2 and CH4; and (3) the synthesis of ammonia from N-2 gas. Comparison of the yields obtained by using nanoporous and nonporous (conventional) polarized HAp catalysts shows that both the nanoporosity and water absorption capacity of the former represent a drawback when the catalytic reaction requires auxiliary coating layers, as for example for the production of amino acids. This is because the surface nanopores achieved by incorporating Pluronic hydrogel are completely hindered by such auxiliary coating layers. On the contrary, the catalytic activity improves drastically for reactions in which the HAp-based scaffolds with enhanced nanoporosity are used as catalysts. More specifically, the carbon fixation from CO2 and CH4 to yield ethanol improves by more than 3000% when compared with nonporous HAp catalyst. Similarly, the synthesis of ammonia by dinitrogen fixation increases by more than 2000%. Therefore, HAp catalysts based on nanoporous scaffolds exhibit an extraordinary potential for scalability and industrial utilization for many chemical reactions, enabling a feasible green chemistry alternative to catalysts based on heavy metals.

It uses a model inter-comparison of three integrated assessment models (TIAM-Grantham, MESSAGE-GLOBIOM and WITCH) harmonized for socio-economic growth drivers using one of the new shared socio-economic pathways (SSP2), to analyse multiple mitigation scenarios aimed at different temperature changes in 2100, in order to assess the model outputs against a range of indicators developed so as to systematically compare the feasibility across scenarios. These indicators include mitigation costs and carbon prices, rates of emissions reductions and energy efficiency improvements, rates of deployment of key low-carbon technologies, reliance on negative emissions, and stranding of power generation assets. The results highlight how much more challenging the 2 degrees C goal is, when compared to the 2.5-4 degrees C goals, across virtually all measures of feasibility. Any delay in mitigation or limitation in technology options also renders the 2 degrees C goal much less feasible across the economic and technical dimensions explored. Finally, a sensitivity analysis indicates that aiming for less than 2 degrees C is even less plausible, with significantly higher mitigation costs and faster carbon price increases, significantly faster decarbonization and zero-carbon technology deployment rates, earlier occurrence of very significant carbon capture and earlier onset of global net negative emissions. Such a systematic analysis allows a more in-depth consideration of what realistic level of long-term temperature changes can be achieved and what adaptation strategies are therefore required.

While important advancements have been made in the scale, performance, and economics of clean energy technologies, meeting the nation's ambitious goals will not only require their deployment at scale, but also additional innovation and effective integration of different solutions. Technological developments across the broad suite of low-carbon energy solutions are advancing rapidly, with ongoing in-novations in renewable electricity generation, industrial processes, and energy-saving technologies and services, including LED lighting, induction heating, electric vehicles, energy storage solutions, and mobility as a service, plus smart devices, controls, and more efficient and smart buildings. Combining renewable electricity with biotic and abiotic pathways to produce chemicals, fuels, and materials promises to deliver new solutions. Grid -interactive buildings and communities, integrating transportation infrastructure and vehicles, are likely to be significant components of any zero-carbon energy strategy. Low-carbon industrial manufacturing will also make strong contributions to a net-zero economy. While the technical prospects appear promising, variations in the state of infrastructure, jurisdictional and social equity, pollution, economic and socio-cultural constraints, energy resource availability, and supply chain dynamics found in different locations present a range of challenges and demand customized solutions. This paper provides a critical review and offers new insights into the technical, infrastructure, analytic, political, and economic challenges faced in translating the nation's ambitious net-zero -emissions goals into feasible and reliable implementation action plans.

Towards standardized nuclear reactors: Seismic isolation and the cost impact of the earthquake load case	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							RISK-ASSESSMENT	Nuclear energy has a key role to play in global decarbonization. Impediments to the widespread deployment of reactors are their projected high capital cost and levelized cost of energy, and time required to analyze, design, license, construct, and commission them. The earthquake load case is a key cost driver for a new build nuclear plant, because near-surface soils and seismic hazard are different at each site, requiring site-specific analysis, design, engineering, qualification, licensing, and regulatory review, essentially making every design First-of-a-Kind (FoaK). To enable deployment at the scale needed for deep decarbonization, the cost and time impact of the seismic load case must be significantly mitigated, and plants must be standardized. Seismic base isolation has been proven to considerably reduce the earthquake response of structures and equipment but has yet to be applied to a nuclear power plant in the United States, in part because the financial impacts, positive or negative, are not known. Because there are no recent non-proprietary data to characterize the influence of the seismic load case on capital cost, it is difficult to confidently quantify the financial benefits of seismic isolation.& nbsp;Scheme-level designs of two fundamentally different advanced reactor buildings were developed to assemble cost data on the influence of the seismic load case. Both buildings were equipped with three bespoke pieces of safety-related equipment and analyzed for incremented levels of earthquake shaking to quantify the seismic penalty on equipment, in terms of vessel weights and horizontal accelerations. Using analysis results, a questionnaire was developed and transmitted to nuclear utilities, reactor developers, engineers, and equipment suppliers to collect cost data on engineering and fabrication costs for these unique pieces of safety class equipment. Synthesis of the cost data showed that the seismic load case significantly affects the capital cost (sum of engineering and fabrication cost) of safety class equipment, with engineering costs being comparable to fabrication costs. Standardization of safety-class equipment is made possible by seismic isolation, that is, equipment designed for minimal seismic robustness can resist earthquake shaking at a site of much higher seismic hazard. The average reduction in the capital cost of the safety-related equipment, enabled by seismic isolation, is a factor of two for FoaK equipment and a factor of five for standardized equipment.

Life-Cycle Assessment Considerations for Batteries and Battery Materials	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						carbon footprint; environmental impacts; life-cycle assessments; lithium-ion batteries	LITHIUM-ION BATTERY; ELECTRIC VEHICLE-BATTERIES; NICKEL-METAL HYDRIDE; ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT ASSESSMENT; PLUG-IN HYBRID; OF-THE-ART; CAPACITY FADE; RENEWABLE ENERGY; STORAGE-SYSTEMS; 2ND LIFE	Rechargeable batteries are necessary for the decarbonization of the energy systems, but life-cycle environmental impact assessments have not achieved consensus on the environmental impacts of producing these batteries. Nonetheless, life cycle assessment (LCA) is a powerful tool to inform the development of better-performing batteries with reduced environmental burden. This review explores common practices in lithium-ion battery LCAs and makes recommendations for how future studies can be more interpretable, representative, and impactful. First, LCAs should focus analyses of resource depletion on long-term trends toward more energy and resource-intensive material extraction and processing rather than treating known reserves as a fixed quantity being depleted. Second, future studies should account for extraction and processing operations that deviate from industry best-practices and may be responsible for an outsized share of sector-wide impacts, such as artisanal cobalt mining. Third, LCAs should explore at least 2-3 battery manufacturing facility scales to capture size- and throughput-dependent impacts such as dry room conditioning and solvent recovery. Finally, future LCAs must transition away from kg of battery mass as a functional unit and instead make use of kWh of storage capacity and kWh of lifetime energy throughput.

It is urgent to address urban heat problems. Buildings are an important cause of urban heat, while buildings are favorable spaces to deal with urban heat problems through built environment decarbonization and the implementation of cooling strategies. Green building (GB) which has been recognized as an innovative philosophy and practice in the building sector, is proposed to address urban heat challenges. However, existing studies have offered a limited understanding of GB-based urban heat mitigation and adaptation (UHMA). Therefore, this study aims to examine how GBs can contribute to UHMA. In particular, this study analyses the contribution of buildings to urban heat problems in aspects of carbon emissions and the extensive modifications towards artificial landscapes, and discusses the possible impacts caused by urban heat problems. Afterwards, this study develops the framework of GB's responses to urban heat in global warming mitigation, local warming mitigation, and urban heat adaptation. Based on this, such responses are analyzed in aspects of site planning, outdoor environments, transportation, building design, energy efficiency, water efficiency, material efficiency, indoor environmental quality, operation management, construction, and maintenance following the whole life cycle perspective. This paper helps understand how GB techniques contribute to UHMA and provides a reference to the revision of the GB assessment system for addressing urban heat problems. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

While techno-conomic and environmental studies on green methanol following a life-cycle perspective are available, its social implications from a supply-chain standpoint remain largely unexplored. In order to fill this gap, this work presents the first social life cycle assessment of green methanol produced with CO2 directly captured from the air and hydrogen from wind power electrolysis. When compared to conventional methanol from natural gas, the results suggest an unfavourable performance of green methanol under negative social indicators (forced labour, women in the sectoral labour force, health expenditure, social responsibility promotion, and fair salary) due to the increased supply-chain complexity of the green system. In contrast, green methanol would outperform its conventional counterpart in terms of sectoral contribution to economic development, a positive social indicator which would benefit from the increase in working hours. Besides future consideration of a higher number of positive indicators and potential improvements in country- and sector-specific risk levels towards high-quality social and working conditions, an enhanced social life-cycle performance of green methanol requires technical improvements to reduce the high demand for energy inputs and equipment across its supply chain. Acknowledging decarbonisation as the actual driver of green methanol deployment, future social studies are suggested to focus on the comparison of renewable alternatives for its production and the effect of social regulations.

The present work develops a techno-economic tool that analyses different scenarios to assess microalgae production in some foreseeable situations, and determines the ones in which the contribution of CO2 biofixation would be relevant. The biomass production cost ranged between 0.41 and 13.06 (sic)/kg. It was also possible to recover 0.03-0.1 (sic)/kg CO2 depending on its temporal variation and the amount of biomass produced. This analysis aims to identify the technologies and operational conditions viable for the different applications. According to the scenarios considered, microalgae technology could be competitive if the emission rights market reaches expected costs of approximately 50 (sic)/t CO2 in the near future (2030). Otherwise, microalgae related processes can be also reliable for different medium- and high-value applications, but only if adequate technologies and operational conditions are considered. The information here provided supports decision making processes for microalgae based processes.

Prioritising the most economically promising investments is not straightforward because apart from cost-effectiveness calculations, several real-world constraints have to be taken into account. This paper describes an approach to assess the economically viable energy efficiency potential in the building sector of the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, with a combination of detailed engineering modelling, cost-effectiveness calculations and real-world considerations of budgetary, technical, behavioural and market constraints. We examine diverse cost-effectiveness indices and come up with a proposal for prioritising specific energy investments such as the installation of heat pumps, insulation of roofs, and replacement of lighting and electronic equipmentwithout however ignoring other measures that may be economically less favourable but can realistically be implemented in a limited number of buildings. Finally we address the governance of energy efficiency policies, focusing on weaknesses of the current regulatory environment in Cyprus, which can be generalised for many other countries facing similar dilemmas.

In the context of global Internet development and the widespread use of digital technologies, this study develops an evaluation system to measure China's digital economy by using provincial panel data from 2007 to 2019. Four dimensions are covered, including digital economy development carrier, digital industrialization, industrial digitalization, and digital economy development environment. Based on a comprehensive explanation of the influence mechanism, generalized method of moments and other econometric methods are used to examine the direct effect of digital economy on LCD. An intermediary effect model is then applied to explore its indirect transmission mechanism, followed by several heterogeneity analyses. The results show that digital economy is gradually becoming an essential driver for regional low-carbon development. Environmental governance, technological innovation, and industrial structure upgrade are the three primary channels for digital economy to influence LCD. The intermediary role of industrial structure upgrade is the largest, while technological innovation is the smallest. Results of heterogeneity analysis show that the decarbonization of digital economy is better in the eastern region but not significant in the central and western regions. In addition, since the launch of the carbon emissions trading pilot in China, digital economy has significantly contributed to low-carbon development. This study provides valuable implications for China to achieve low-carbon development and valuable insights to other countries so that they can actively engage in energy conservation and emissions reduction.

However, global decarbonization efforts, such as decommissioning of coal-fired power plants, will limit the supply of SCMs. Therefore, alternative SCM sources are a critical need for the cement and concrete industry. However, the high crystallinity of zeolites limits their pozzolanic reactivity. The goal of this work was to improve the reactivity of two common zeolites, namely clinoptilolite and SSZ-13, by treating them with sulfuric acid. The treatment enhanced zeolite reactivity via dealumination and decreased particle sizes, which led to increased reactivity with calcium hydroxide, as indicated by a 42.0% increase in reaction heat measured by isothermal calorimetry. We elucidate mechanistic understanding that smaller particle sizes induced by acid treatment accelerated peak heat evolution, while free aluminates from dealumination increased heat via direct reaction with aqueous Ca2+.

However, the implementation of more effective policies which accelerate the deployment of this market is needed. In this study, after an overview of the residential PV prosumer (RPVP) market's status in Chile, critical parameters that can speed-up the deployment of this segment through policy decisions were identified. Considering the local conditions of each regional capital in Chile, the segment is analyzed with widely-used econometric techniques to evaluate the residential PV systems feasibility empirically. The results show that the Chilean regulatory framework is insufficient for exploiting the potential of the RPVP. Without effective policy instruments, high investment costs and low income per household are the main barriers in the deployment of the segment in this country. Therefore, suitable promotion energy policies, regulatory changes, and financing options can accelerate the deployment without majorly impacting on the national budget. This would let citizens help accelerate decarbonization through a more decentralized and democratic energy transition, gaining socio-economic and socio-environmental benefits, based on solar PV technology.

In this context, this study shows the potentialities of a system based on solar thermal collectors, a biomass boiler and an innovative reversible hybrid heat pump/ORC concept for addressing heating, cooling and domestic hot water demand of residential buildings. The potential is investigated in three cities (Madrid, Berlin and Helsinki), representative of the different European climates. The share of renewables in different seasons and building typologies is presented and the possibility of obtaining a 100% renewable system when the solution proposed is installed in new and renovated buildings is discussed. The results show that in standard multi-family houses, up to 70% of heating demand and 100% of cooling demand can be covered by the system in warmer climates and up to 60% share of renewables can be reached in Northern climates. Moreover, the flexible configuration of the system shows the potential for the application in the future energy system of the EU. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The Role of Innovation in Industry Product Deployment: Developing Thermal Energy Storage for Concentrated Solar Power	ENERGIES			English	Article						innovation; concentrated solar power; product deployment; pilot plant	PILOT-PLANT SCALE; LESSONS LEARNT; COLLABORATION; TECHNOLOGY; SYSTEM; UNIVERSITIES; CORROSION; FIRMS	Industries with fast-developing technologies and knowledge-intensive business services rely on the development of scientific knowledge for their growth. This is also true in the renewable energy industry such as in concentrating solar power (CSP) plants, which have undergone intense development and expansion in the last two decades. Yet knowledge generation is not sufficient; its dissemination and internalization by the industry is indispensable for new product development. This paper contributes to providing empirical evidence on the known link between knowledge development and firm growth. In 10 years the cost of electricity produced through CSP has decreased five-fold. This decrease has only been possible due to innovation projects developed through a complex network of research and development (R&D) collaborations and intense investment, both public and (to a greater extent) private. The development and construction of pilot plants and demonstration facilities are shown to be key in maturing innovations for commercialization. This is an example of how the private sector is contributing to the decarbonisation of our energy system, contributing to the objectives of climate change mitigation.

A multi-stage investment model in generating and storage capacity from the point of view of a central planner is presented, considering long-term uncertainties in the decision-making process, such as the demand growth and the investment and fuel costs, and short-term variability. To evaluate the wellness of the expansion strategies according to the CO2 emissions generated and the total cost, second-order stochastic dominance constraints are introduced in the model. This approach allows to obtain better expansion strategies enforcing acceptable distributions of CO2 emissions. The numerical study is carried out considering the case of the European power system. The predictions and suggestions made by the European Commission towards 2050 are the basis to define the benchmark solutions, whose outcomes are analysed. The results obtained from this study highlight that a renewable capacity of at least 2900 GW is needed to attain a net zero CO2 emission European power system. The strategy based on carbon capture and storage does not reduce effectively CO2 emissions while it represents an expensive alternative. Including stochastic dominance in the optimization model allows to obtain less expensive alternative expansion strategies with comparatively lower CO2 emissions in the worst scenarios.

J	Di Felice, LJ; Renner, A; Giampietro, M				Jane Di Felice, Louisa; Renner, Ansel; Giampietro, Mario			Why should the EU implement electric vehicles? Viewing the relationship between evidence and dominant policy solutions through the lens of complexity	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Electric cars; Narratives; Complexity; Evidence-based policy; Science-policy interface	LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS; LITHIUM AVAILABILITY; ENERGY TRANSITIONS; KNOWLEDGE; SCIENCE; SUSTAINABILITY; UNCERTAINTY; PREDICAMENT; NARRATIVES	Electric vehicles are a dominant policy solution in the EU. In policy documents, a transition to electric vehicles is justified through promises of a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and oil imports, as well as positive impacts on citizens (through reduced pollution) and the economy (through a boost in manufacturing and the generation of jobs). The evidence supporting such claims remains uncertain. Taking a stance that is grounded in complexity science, we introduce a hierarchical mapping of policy mechanisms, concerns and solutions - the elements making up policy narratives. Building on this mapping, we focus on questioning the solutionjustification relationship for electric vehicles, by critically inspecting the material coherence between these justifications and the existing existing evidence. A targeted review shows how, for example, positive economic impacts largely depend on the location of battery and car manufacturing; or GHG emission reductions depend on promises of decarbonisation of the electricity sector, as well as on driving behaviours. Innovations are not just material objects, and such evidence does not necessarily weaken the dominant policy solution, nor the sociotechnical imaginary it is grounded in. By questioning the material coherence of EV justification narratives in the EU, this case study points to a discussion about the effects of dominant policy narratives on the generation of science, warning against policy-based evidence in the co-creation of socio-technical imaginaries.

J	del Rosal, I				del Rosal, Ignacio			European dieselization: Policy insights from EU car trade	TRANSPORT POLICY			English	Article						Diesel cars; Climate policy; European union; International trade; Dieselization; Petrol cars	MODELING TRANSPORT ENERGY; DIESEL VEHICLES; PASSENGER CARS; CO2 EMISSIONS; FUEL-ECONOMY; STANDARDS; DEMAND; GRAVITY; TAXES; CONSUMPTION	European dieselization, i.e. the sustained increase in the diesel share in the passenger car fleet, is associated with the first EU strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars. This paper aims to contribute to the literature on dieselization by looking at EU international trade flows in passenger cars, a perspective seldom found in the literature. Trade data confirm that the bulk of EU diesel trade flows occurs between EU partners, although diesel imports from other, non-EU countries are also significant. Besides, the external competitiveness of the EU car industry is clearly based on petrol cars. The analysis of trade data also reflects previous findings on the increase in car size. On the policy side, the divergence between CO2 from new car registrations and total CO2 emissions from passenger cars during the dieselization era proves that strategies for decarbonization should not rely exclusively on efficiency gains, demand policies are also needed. The dieselization phenomenon warns of the major inertia that road transport policies can have. The analysis of EU car trade also underlines the need to coordinate environmental policy with other relevant countries in the international car market.

J	Kumeh, EM; Kyereh, B; Birkenberg, A; Birner, R				Kumeh, Eric Mensah; Kyereh, Boateng; Birkenberg, Athena; Birner, Regina			Customary power, farmer strategies and the dynamics of access to protected forestlands for farming: Implications for Ghana's forest bioeconomy	FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Socio-ecological conflicts; Deforestation; Access; Food security; Forest-based bioeconomy	MODIFIED TAUNGYA SYSTEM; LAND; TENURE; DISPOSSESSION; CONSERVATION; CHIEFTAINCY; CONSTRAINTS; MANAGEMENT; AUTHORITY; RIGHTS	In the last decade, multiple scientists and policymakers have been promoting bioeconomy for decarbonisation and as a way to tackle the ongoing socio-ecological crises. An effective transition to the bioeconomy in devel-oping countries, which are predominantly agrarian,depends partly on its amenability to existing land access regimes and how actors in such countries are able to manage competing claims and needs associated with land use for biomass production. However, this is sparingly examined in the bioeconomy-politics literature. Using a case study from Ghana, a Global South context aspiring towards a forest-based bioeconomy, we analyze how overlapping legal and normative institutions mediate forest-dependent communities' access to lands in forest reserves for their food and other livelihood needs. The study found that state and traditional institutions are racing to sanction forest communities' access to forest reserve lands in order to consolidate their authority over the area. In the emerging bioeconomy, the state employs plantation forestry as a tool to consolidate its control. Concurrently, traditional authorities contend this by facilitating farmers' access to the same area for cocoa production to establish claims to the land. Amid this contest, forest communities have constructed a robust discourse centred on their 'right to food', enabling them to apply their rich local knowledge to cultivate food and cash crops in forest reserves without deference to state institutions and traditional authorities. State forestry officials react by cutting down these 'illegal farms', causing periodic food insecurity in the study localities. Some farmers respond by adapting their access mechanisms, cultivating deeper into the reserve to evade forestry of-ficials. The dynamism of this conflict makes sustainable resource use challenging in the study localities. But it also indicates that without proper safeguards and a coherent rural development policy, the bioeconomy will become an approach for reproducing oppressive land accumulation, impeding forest communities ability to address their food and livelihood needs. Thus, while the findings bring to date the growing struggle over land in Sub-Saharan Africa, it cautions that governments need to recognize that the bioeconomy, despite its promise of sustainability, is no quick fix for entrenched structural problems in rural Africa.

J	Kuzmina, V; Parhomchuk, M; Minakova, I				Kuzmina, Violetta; Parhomchuk, Marina; Minakova, Irina			Russian NFG, TNC and SOC of the oil and gas complex on the regional and world markets	ECONOMIC ANNALS-XXI			English	Article						Oil and Gas Complex; national financial group; transnational company; small oil company; Russian Federation; OPEC+; Import Dependence; Majors; Sanctions Policy		The most powerful Russian NFG (national financial group) (Lukoil, Tatneft, Sibur Holding), transnational companies (TNCs) (Gazprom, Rosneft) and small oil companies (SOCs) (Sibir Energy PLC, West Siberian Resources) operate in the oil and gas complex. The oil and gas complex traditionally acts as a guarantor of the country's energy security. The new economic conditions in 2021 are associated with a decrease in demand for oil and products from it, high dependence on imports, and the suspension of wells to complete a deal under OPEC ++, which will lead to a market drop by 3-10%. The purpose of the paper is to conduct a comparative analysis of Russian NFG, TNCs and SOCs in the regional and global oil and gas markets. The initial materials used to conduct the research were statistical data from the Center for Macroeconomic Analysis and Short-Term Forecasting, the Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation, the Analytical Center under the Government of the Russian Federation and world rating reports. The pandemic and self-isolation of 2020 have led to a decrease in the intensity of global supply chains, affecting Russian NFGs, TNCs and SOCs in the oil and gas sector. The Russian oil and gas sector has lost 50-60% of its proceeds from the export of hydrocarbons, which is more than 50% of its capitalization. To support the industry, the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation will have allocated RUB 35 billion by 2024. Today, Russian NFGs, TNCs and SOCs operate in conditions of a negative damper, contraction of the domestic market, reduction of crack spreads and restrictions on production growth. Therefore, the following is relevant for them: for NFGs - search for new sales markets (for example, Asia), for TNCs - the use of innovative technologies to maintain the profitability of oil and gas production, for SOCs - development of small deposits and deposits with hard-to-recover reserves. For TNC net importers of oil from the European Union, Japan, and Korea, the electromobilization process is a potential source of economic growth. European majors, such as BP, Equinor, Shell and Total, have set decarbonization goals, transforming from oil and gas to diversified energy companies.

Despite this and the programmes implemented to promote it in the residential environment in Europe and the United States, the barriers that homes, contractors, and finance companies face to undertake these processes have slowed down the results. The emergence of one-stop-shops (OSSs), promoted by European directives, as integrated management entities to promote the energy renovation of dwellings seems to be a central element in the development of future strategies. This paper looks at experiences of implementing OSSs in Europe, tries to identify the main factors of success, and proposes lines of action to strengthen OSS operation in the long term. To achieve this, documents, regulations, and data on the context were studied, and active cases of OSSs were analysed. Experiences of OSSs that are no longer operating were identified to determine why they had closed down. The results suggested that a lack of structural funding is one reason why activities terminated and that the most successful cases applied an 'all inclusive' model and supported families in the entire process.

Drawing on first-hand evidence collected from a coal city in Inner Mongolia, China, we found that while the coal workers from state-owned mines were supported by job reallocation and retirement plans, the coal workers from privately owned mines, who were mostly of rural origin and hold a rural hukou, were laid-off without adequate compensation and job assistance. Furthermore, the government failed to help the private coal workers, as the predicament of the private coal workers was not considered the responsibility of the government. These issues were fundamentally linked to China's political economic contexts such as rural-urban inequality, incomplete marketization, and authoritarianism. In addition to demonstrating the importance of understanding just transition through a political economy perspective that is sensitive to local contexts, the findings also warn against treating workers from the fossil fuel industry as a homogenized whole because it may mask the reality of structural inequality, obscure the differences among workers, and create a false appearance of justice by excluding certain groups from the logic of a just transition for all. We argue that the transition cannot be considered as "just" without identifying who is the most vulnerable group affected by such a transition. Therefore, "just transition for whom" is a key question in the evaluation of transition management.

Drilling into mines for heat: geological synthesis of the UK Geoenergy Observatory in Glasgow and implications for mine water heat resources	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND HYDROGEOLOGY			English	Article							COAL-MINE; GEOTHERMAL-ENERGY; NORMAL FAULTS; SUSTAINABILITY; CHALLENGES; COLLIERY	Thermal energy from groundwater in abandoned, flooded, coal mines has the potential to make a significant contribution to decarbonization of heat and net-zero carbon emissions. In Glasgow, UK, a subsurface observatory has been constructed for mine water heat and heat storage research. We synthesize geological and mine water resource findings from a 4 year period of borehole planning, drilling, logging and testing. The heterogeneous bedrock is typical of the Scottish Coal Measures Group, whereas superficial deposits are more sand- and gravel-dominated than predicted. Mine water boreholes encountered workings in the Glasgow Upper, Glasgow Ell and Glasgow Main coal seams, proving water-filled voids, mine waste, fractured rock mass and intact coal pillars, with high yields on initial hydrogeological testing. Although the depth and extent of mine workings delineated on mine abandonment plans proved accurate, metre-scale variability was expected and proved in the boreholes. A mine water reservoir classification established from the observatory boreholes highlights the resource potential in areas of total extraction, stowage, and stoop and room workings. Because their spatial extent is more extensive across the UK than shafts or roadways, increasing the mine water energy evidence base and reducing exploration risk in these types of legacy workings is important. Supplementary material: Borehole reports and other datasets are available at (mixture of over 20 DOI datasets and reports or data packs published openly on ; all material is deposited in the National Geoscience Data Centre).

Nevertheless, because of the high number of technical options available for hydrogen production, their suitability needs to be thoroughly evaluated from a life-cycle perspective. The standardised concept of eco-efficiency is suitable for this purpose since it relates, with a life-cycle perspective, the environmental performance of a product system to its value. Hence, this work benchmarks the eco-efficiency performance of renewable hydrogen produced through biomass gasification against conventional hydrogen from the steam reforming of natural gas. For the eco-efficiency assessment, the harmonised environmental indicators of global warming, acidification and cumulative non-renewable energy demand were individually used, while the product system value was based on the levelised cost of hydrogen with/without internalisation of the external socio-environmental costs associated with climate change and human health. On the one hand, when the environmental and economic performances are separately considered, hydrogen from biomass gasification performs significantly better than hydrogen from steam methane reforming under environmental aspects (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions saving of 98%), whereas the opposite conclusion was found from an economic standpoint (levelised cost of 3.59 (sic) and 2.17 (sic) per kilogramme of renewable and fossil hydrogen, respectively). On the other hand, when combining life-cycle environmental and economic indicators under the umbrella of the eco-efficiency assessment, it is concluded that the renewable hydrogen option outperforms the conventional one, which is further remarked when implementing socio-environmental externalities. In this regard, a relative eco-efficiency score above 14 was estimated for the renewable hydrogen option when benchmarked against conventional hydrogen. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Sahagian, T; Christian, R				Sahagian, Tom; Christian, Rory			A Path to 80 x 50 for Public Housing Authorities	CITYSCAPE			English	Article								Many cities now mandate large reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in residential buildings, including public housing. The authors summarize the recently released plan of the New York City Housing Authority to achieve these reductions. States, cities, and counties have all advanced the drive to reduce emissions over many years. As of today, more than 30 states have economy-wide emissions reduction targets in place, according to Clifton et al. (2020). Billimoria et. al. (2018) and Steinberg et. al. (2017) point out that these goals, established either through legislation or executive order, typically call for reducing greenhouse gases (GHGs) 80 percent by 2050 (80 x 50) when compared with a prior benchmark (for example, 2005 levels). In parallel with this, Trumbull et al. (2019) identified 12 states; Puerto Rico; Washington, D.C.; and more than 200 cities and counties that have established goals to generate 100 percent carbon: free electricity by 2050-with some aiming for as early as 2032. This patchwork of policies is largely a reaction to the absence of a unifying federal policy for reducing emissions. Should the federal government establish a national policy, the efforts to reduce emissions are likely to accelerate. Residential and commercial buildings account for 38 percent of all energy used in the United States and are responsible for 10 percent of GHG emissions. Increased efficiency and electrification-addressed through mandates and better building codes-can significantly reduce the building sector's contribution to climate change. With the trend toward decarbonization firmly established across much of the country, many buildings may soon be required to make significant reductions in energy use and emissions that will be achievable only by a transition away from fossil fuels. New York City is uniquely affected by state and city policies to reduce GHG emissions and to meet building-specific emission reduction targets. These policies require building owners to look beyond traditional energy-efficiency measures. The New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) recently released a detailed plan for meeting the 80 x 50 requirements with readily available technology (NYCHA, 2020). This article summarizes the NYCHA plan and includes general recommendations that other public housing authorities (PHAs) can adopt to reduce their GHG emissions significantly.

It is shown that the vanadium-containing system includes several complexes with different thermal stabilities and catalytic activities. Low-active complexes are destroyed with the formation of more active ones based on V2O5 oxide, as the temperature of heat treatment increases. It can be assumed that V2O5 oxide has the decisive role in its catalytic activity. It was concluded that the vanadium-containing catalytic system on aluminium oxide, in the studied temperature range, is thermally stable and shows high activity not only in the reduction of nitrogen oxides but also in the oxidation of hydrocarbons (even of the most difficult ones, such as oxidizable methane). These properties of the system make it quite promising in the field of application for the purification of the exhaust gases of motor transport and industrial enterprises with environmentally harmful components, as well as for understanding the mechanism of the action of the catalysts in these processes, which is very important for solving the problems of decarbonization and achieving carbon neutrality.

Combining offshore wind and solar photovoltaic energy to stabilize energy supply under climate change scenarios: A case study on the western Iberian Peninsula	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS			English	Article						Offshore wind energy; Solar energy; CORDEX; Climate change; West Iberian Peninsula; Climate projections	ECONOMIC-FEASIBILITY; RESOURCES; MODELS; COAST; TEMPERATURE; PROJECTIONS; TECHNOLOGY; CORDEX	The expansion of marine renewable power is a major alternative for the reduction of greenhouse gases emissions. In Europe, however, the high penetration of offshore wind brings intermittency and power variability into the existing power grid. Offshore solar photovoltaic power is another technological alternative under consideration in the plans for decarbonization. However, future variations in wind, air temperature or solar radiation due to climate change will have a great impact on both renewable energy resources. In this context, this study focusses on the offshore energy assessment off the coast of Western Iberia, a European region encompassing Portugal and the Northwestern part of Spain. Making use of a vast source of data from 35 simulations of a research project called CORDEX, this study investigates the complementarity of offshore wind and solar energy sources with the aim of improving the energy supply stability of this region up to 2040. Although the offshore wind energy resource has proven to be higher than solar photovoltaic resource at annual scale, both renewable resources showed significant spatiotemporal energy variability throughout the western Iberian Peninsula. When both renewable resources are combined, the stability of the energy resource increased considerably throughout the year. The proposed wind and solar combination scheme is assessed by a performance classification method called Delphi, considering stability, resource, risk, and economic factors. The total index classification increases when resource stability is improved by considering hybrid offshore wind-photovoltaic solar energy production, especially along the nearshore waters.

However, due to variabilities in solar and wind generation, energy storage will play an essential role in the decarbonization of the electrical grid. We examined the implications of adding wind and solar on a terawatt-scale in India's electricity mix and estimated the storage (energy and power capacity) requirements by balancing hourly supply and demand for a 30-year-long-period starting from 2019 until 2048. We used meteorological reanalysis data from MERRA-2 (Modern Era Retrospective-analysis for Research and Application) for hourly wind speed and solar irradiance for the simulation. The results indicated that a solar-dominated capacity mix needed small seasonal storage and required larger storage power capacity to support 'boost' charging during the few high sunny hours to meet the demand for many non-sunny hours. Wind-dominated generation depended on large seasonal storage - most charging occurs during monsoon months (July through September) - and discharging in autumn to early winters. The paper discusses the performance of different terawatt scale designs and concludes with their implications for India's energy transition.

In this review, we specifically focus on anaerobic digestion (AD) intensified via hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) and modeling as an effective biomass valorization strategy. AD is known to generate renewable energy (biogas) and fertilizer (digestate) and is therefore aligned with the circular economy framework and has the potential to decarbonize the transportation, energy, and heat sectors, which contribute a major share to the current global carbon emissions. The AD-based pathway, though robust, has key challenges such as poor carbon conversion and subpar biogas yields coupled with long residence times. This is mainly due to the recalcitrance offered by the feedstock. HC-based biomass pretreatment is critically reviewed here as a promising AD intensification strategy to overcome this recalcitrance. HC devices and their key aspects of design and scale-up are discussed. Vortex-based HC devices were found to be superior to conventional linear flow HC devices in terms of pretreatment performance and ease of scale up. The use of reaction engineering models of AD for overall optimization of biomass valorization is also discussed. The need for developing an intermediate modeling approach between empirical models and complex biochemical pathway-based models is highlighted. Such an intermediate approach requires simple biomethane potential (BMP) measurements for obtaining essential model parameters. With such parameters obtained from BMP data, the model was found to be useful for simulating and optimizing performance of AD. A prospective AD-based biorefinery is briefly discussed with multiple allied valorization pathways. This review will be useful to researchers and practicing engineers for realizing effective valorization of waste biomass.

For instance, solar energy is abundant, inexhaustible, non-polluting, and low-priced; however, to produce energy on a large scale with reliable, cost-efficient, and environmentally friendly methods remains a challenge. The outstanding optical properties of Cu(In,Ga)Se-2 thin film photovoltaics and their intrinsic compatibility with industrial-scale production are paving the way towards this technology. However, most of the activity in the field relies on the use of non-environmentally friendly methodologies to achieve solution-processed flexible and lightweight photovoltaics with significant efficiencies. Importantly, there is a search for more sustainable alternatives that are compatible with roll-to-roll industry to improve the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of photovoltaics without compromising the photovoltaic performance. Herein, we review cost-efficient and sustainable fabrication methodologies that complement the current highenergy-demanding vacuum-based fabrication of Cu(In,Ga)Se-2 photovoltaics. The existent non-vacuum deposition methods of Cu(In,Ga)Se-2 photoabsorbers are presented and precursors and solvents used in ink formulations are discussed in terms of sustainability. The approaches resulting in most efficient photovoltaic cells are highlighted. Finally, all-solution-processed Cu(In,Ga)Se-2 photovoltaics are reviewed, along with the non-vacuum deposition methods of the individual layers, contributing to an even higher throughput and low-cost production. This review highlights the relevance and potential of sustainable non-vacuum methodologies, as well as the need of further investigation in this field to ultimately give access to high-end CIGS PVs with low-cost fabrication.

J	Cheng, AWJ; Lee, HF				Cheng, Alex W. J.; Lee, Harry F.			Energy Transition towards Sustainable Development: Perspective of Individuals' Engagement Amid Transition Process	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						energy transition; pro-environmental behavior; sustainable development; carbon neutrality	SELF-REPORTS; BEHAVIOR; DECARBONIZATION; WILLINGNESS; GOVERNANCE; SCIENCE	The energy transition towards sustainable development is a significant propeller to achieving carbon neutrality and reducing the further impact of human-induced climate change through decarbonizing the energy sector. Yet, the discussion often neglects individual engagement and participation. Emerging studies and research focus on energy transition readiness and the attitude-behavior gap on both (inter-) national and public participation levels. Still, similar bottom-up research and studies on individual engagement in energy transition are rare in the context of Asia. Based on an online questionnaire (N = 150) conducted in Hong Kong from February to March 2022, this study followed the Attitude-Behavior-Context (A-B-C) Model to investigate whether individual pro-energy transition behavior was affected by both internal socio-psychological variables and the external socio-economic context. The data collected was analyzed by Cronbach's alpha and multiple regression analysis. Statistical results show that individuals' internal socio-psychological variables significantly contributed to the pro-energy transition behavior of Hong Kong citizens in terms of their pro-energy transition practices and other engagements in energy transition-related activities. In contrast, pro-energy transition behavior was less explained by the socio-economic context perceived by the respondents, and the explained behavior was limited to the respondents' other engagements in energy-transition-related activities. The above findings suggest that citizens are in line with the related policies or more readily equipped for energy transition than the government. Government bodies are encouraged to set more ambitious targets and actions to achieve the 2050 carbon neutrality goal. The conceptualization of energy behavior and habit formation may help reduce the disparity of transition readiness among different stakeholders in Hong Kong.	[Cheng, Alex W.

Hybrid wind-wave farms can reduce installation and maintenance costs, and increase the renewable energy availability of a location by compensating for the wind's intermittent nature with good wave conditions. In addition, wave farms can provide protection to wind farms, and the combined wind/wave farm can provide coastal protection. This work aims to assess the future hybrid wind-wave energy resource for the northwest coast of Iberian Peninsula for the near future (2026-2045), under the RCP 8.5 greenhouse gas emission scenario. This assessment was accomplished by applying a Delphi classification method to define four categories, aiming to evaluate the richness (wind and wave energy availability, downtime), the variability (temporal variation), the environmental risk (extreme events), and cost parameters (water depth and distance to coast) of the wind and wave resources. The combined index (CI), which classifies the hybrid wind-wave resource, shows that most of the NW Iberian Peninsula presents good conditions (CI > 0.6) for exploiting energy from wind and wave resources simultaneously. Additionally, there are some particularly optimal areas (CI > 0.7), such as the region near Cape Roca, and the Galician coast.

This means that this survey does not analyze existing products or realized buildings, but provides an overview of the technologies for BIPV. The starting point is an analysis of the relevance of BIPV technologies for the decarbonization of energy systems, providing energy for direct use of electricity and sector coupling together with an analysis of the German BIPV market. The paper presents the wide range of technical design options for BIPV systems and categorizes and analyzes them to provide a structured overview. This comprises a detailed analysis of the design options for BIPV modules, in which not only the design options for the PV cell layer were comprehensively investigated, but also the different variants of embedding materials, front and rear cover materials, additional interlayers and electrical module layout. Two fundamental module-level design options were investigated in particular detail: The use of PV cells as basic elements of patterns and the use of color to conceal the PV cells. Subsequently, options for the design of complete electrical systems are reviewed, ranging from sub-module level design parameters to building energy systems. Design options for the constructional integration of BIPV modules in the building envelope complete the review of technological design possibilities. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Such a system could behave as: an energy storage system, storing excess renewable energy as chemical energy in liquid fuels and converting it into electricity during lack of renewable energy, - a source of fuels and chemicals for a variety of applications in many industrial sectors. This work concerns the conceptual design and performance analysis of a small-scale integrated energy system for the production and use of methanol from renewable hydrogen and captured CO2. The main components of the system are: - a reversible high temperature and high efficiency solid oxide cell (RSOC) that can operate in charge (electrolyser, SOEC) and discharge (fuel cell, SOFC) mode to store and use electricity using methanol as energy storage medium, - a catalytic reactor for methanol synthesis via CO2 hydrogenation. - A thermal energy storage (TES) system based on a phase change material (PCM) is also included. To predict performance of the main components and of the overall system, numerical simulation models were developed. Performance and efficiencies of each system component and of the overall system were evaluated through extensive mass and energy balances, considering two different configurations with and without TES integration. Performance indexes were calculated to analyse the goodness of introducing a TES. The global efficiency of the overall system increases from 30% to 35% when heat is recovered between sections via the TES system.

Given this concern, we explore the ability of concentrating-solar-power plants with thermal energy storage to provide a carbon-free source of such capacity. We develop an approach to assessing the capacity contribution of concentrating-solar-power plants that considers future systems. Such considerations are important, because of potential differences in net-load patterns compared to today (e.g., due to higher renewable-energy penetrations). Using historical data spanning an 18-year period, we demonstrate that concentrating-solar-power plants with thermal energy storage can provide this necessary capacity with little impact on their financial viability. We examine the impact of myopic decisions and imperfect foresight of future system conditions on the operation of concentrating-solar-power plants and the resultant impact on their capacity contributions. We find that imperfect foresight can have limited impacts on such a use of concentrating-solar-power plants, so long as proper forecasting techniques are developed and used. Overall, our work shows that concentrating-solar-power plants with thermal energy storage may have a role to play in delivering reliable electricity supply in a decarbonized energy system.

The Roadmap builds on the IEA BLUE Map scenario that leads to the stabilisation of CO2 emissions at 450ppm by 2050. Achieving this scenario will require an energy technology revolution involving a portfolio of solutions: greater energy efficiency, increased renewable energy technologies and nuclear power, and the near decarbonisation of fossil fuel-based power generation via carbon capture and storage (CCS). In this scenario CCS contributes almost 20% to the total emissions reductions required in 2050. Recommendations are made in the IEA CCS Roadmap on what is required to achieve this level of deployment not only technically, but also from a financial and regulatory point of view as well as in terms of public engagement and international collaboration, including the sharing of knowledge. This paper looks at progress made against these recommendations in the 12 months since the release of the roadmap. Analysis undertaken by the IEA consistently identifies a significant role for CCS in mitigating global CO2 emissions. IEA analysis suggests that there will be a need to capture and store 10 Gt CO2 per year in 2050, from 3400 projects globally to achieve the BLUE Map emissions reduction targets. Significant progress is being made to launch large-scale demonstration facilities across the globe, with some 80 large-scale integrated demonstration projects identified. As of April 2010, public funding commitments were in the range of USD 26.6 billion to USD 36.1 billion. While 5500km of CO2 pipelines already exist and further infrastructure development is planned, it is however clear that to enable large-scale deployment of CCS, more joint planning of CO2 transportation infrastructure is required globally. The status and availability of data on CO2 storage varies significantly around the world and is potentially a major constraint to rapid, widespread CCS deployment. In regions with the potential to store large volumes of CO2, a concerted effort will be required to characterise the basins in sufficient detail. Much progress has been achieved in the legal and regulatory area. The first movers in establishing legal frameworks have generally been OECD countries. It is now important that the large emerging economies start developing their legal and regulatory frameworks. Public awareness and acceptance is a key element in making CCS possible. Public concerns are legitimate and require a close dialogue and sharing of information with the local population. While companies developing transport and storage will need to lead on the engagement processes, governments and politicians have a vital role to play. Several initiatives are in place for international dialogue and collaboration on the development and deployment of CCS. While much progress has been made, many challenges still remain if CCS is to deliver at the scale required. The challenges are well-known and require concerted action by industry, governments, international organisations and civil society. Continued political leadership remains absolutely essential.

Evaluation of Reliability and Robustness of Electric Power Systems with Renewable Energies	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2021 XXIII IEEE INTERNATIONAL AUTUMN MEETING ON POWER, ELECTRONICS AND COMPUTING (ROPEC 2021)	IEEE International Autumn Meeting on Power Electronics and Computing		English	Proceedings Paper	23rd IEEE International Autumn Meeting on Power, Electronics and Computing (ROPEC)	NOV 10-12, 2021	Ixtapa, MEXICO	IEEE, IEEE Centro Occidente Sect		Cascading failures; power systems; reliability; renewable energy; robustness		Renewable energy sources (RESs), such as wind and solar energy, are an integral part of the current process of decarbonisation of electric power systems in the vast majority of countries. Due to the stochastic and variable nature of these resources, RESs could expose an electrical network to unexpected power outages. In this context, security studies are vital for the secure and day-to-day operation of the infrastructure. This article analyses the effects of integrating renewable energies into a power system from the perspectives of reliability and robustness. For this purpose, the IEEE 14-bus test system is modified, and two case studies are proposed with a high proportion of fossil-based power generation and a high share of renewable generation, respectively. In both cases, hourly load and electricity generation profiles are considered. The reliability study is completed using the Monte Carlo probabilistic method, and the robustness study is conducted by simulating cascading failures. These assessments are carried out in the two scenarios, where the electricity system without renewable energies is considered the base case. The effects of renewable energies are analysed comparatively in terms of Loss of Load Probability (LOLP), Expected Demand Not Supplied (EDNS) and Satisfied Demand (SD).

At the same time, numerous renewable methanol production pathways are under development, which, if commercialized, could provide significant environmental benefits over traditional methanol synthesis pathways. However, it is difficult to compare technologies at different maturity levels, with differing feedstocks, and with significant differences in overall process design. Thus, there is a need to harmonize the analyses of renewable pathways using a consistent techno-economic approach to evaluate the potential for commercialization of various pathways. This analysis uses a novel cross-comparison method to assess near-term and long-term viability of both low- and high-maturity level technologies. The techno-economic assessment considers cost factors critical to market acceptance combined with carbon- and energy-efficiency assessments of three renewable pathways compared with a commercial baseline. We find that biomass gasification to methanol represents a near-term viable pathway with a high technology readiness level and commercially competitive market price. If cost-reducing technological improvements can be realized and scaled up in the CO2 electrolysis pathways, the potential for higher carbon efficiencies may help drive market adoption of these more modular, direct conversion pathways in future markets as they present an opportunity to better support global decarbonization efforts through efficient waste carbon utilization.

We also conduct four heterogeneous analyses, and detect the asymmetric, threshold, and mediating effects in the GFI-CLI nexus. The primary findings reveal that: (1) GFI plays a significant role in CLI abatement; (2) the restraining effect of GFI on CLI is more significant in eastern China, first-tier cities, non-resource-based cities, and capital cities; (3) GFI shows an asymmetric correlation with CLI at various quantiles. Moreover, internet penetration would enhance such a negative relationship; (4) GFI has an indirect acceleration effect of eliminating CLI through the channels of innovation, government support, and development of the digital economy. Following the above findings, we propose some suggestions related to climate change mitigation and GFI evolution.

It provides reliable, scalable, and long-term energy storage, while helping in the decarbonization of the energy cycle. Such a storage medium is required for further deployment of photovoltaics, either for their inclusion into transportation and heavy industries or for supporting renewable grid management. The most accessible hydrogen source is water. However, fresh water is a scarce resource, while seawater is abundant worldwide. A major drawback of seawater electrolysis comes from chloride oxidation competing with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This may produce toxic products such as chlorine and also limits the hydrogen energy efficiency of the overall process. Thus, selective catalysts toward the OER are of strong technological interest. Here we report the electrocatalytic activity of heterogeneous cobalt hexacyanoferrate toward seawater oxidation. Combining experimental and computational studies, we highlight the great difficulty in obtaining such selectivity and its main mechanistic descriptors. This Prussian blue derivative is an excellent and robust OER electrocatalyst, but unfortunately, it is not selective enough toward the OER in the presence of Cl- anions. Faradaic efficiencies above 30% toward Cl-2 were observed during untreated seawater bulk electrolysis.

Experimental study of the performance and emission characteristics of an adapted commercial four-cylinder spark ignition engine running on hydrogen-methane mixtures	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Adapted SI engine; Hydrogen-methane mixtures; Hydrogen energy; Internal combustion engine; Emissions; Transportation sector	COMPRESSED NATURAL-GAS; INTERNAL-COMBUSTION ENGINES; EFFICIENCY; GASOLINE; BLENDS; FUEL; SI; CONVERSION; BIOGAS; VEHICLE	The use of hydrogen/methane mixtures with low methane contents as fuels for internal combustion engines (ICEs) may.help to speed up the development of the hydrogen energy market and contribute to the decarbonization of the transportation sector. In this work, a commercial 1.4 L four-cylinder Volkswagen spark-ignition engine previously adapted to operate on pure hydrogen has been fueled with hydrogen/methane mixtures with 5-20 vol.% methane (29.6-66.7 wt.%). An experimental program has been executed by varying the fuel composition, air-to-fuel ratio (lambda), spark advance and engine speed. A discussion of the results regarding the engine performance (brake torque, brake mean effective pressure, thermal efficiency) and emissions (nitrogen oxides, CO and unburned hydrocarbons) is presented. The results reveal that lambda is the most influential variable on the engine behavior due to its marked effect on the combustion temperature. As far as relatively high values of lambda have to be used to prevent knock, the effect on the engine performance is negative. In contrast, the specific emissions of nitrogen oxides decrease due to a reduced formation of thermal NOx. A clear positive effect of reducing the spark advance on the specific NOx emissions has been observed as well. As concerns CO and unburned hydrocarbons (HCs), their specific emissions increase with the methane content of the fuel mixture, as expected. However, they also increase as lambda increases in spite of the lower fuel concentration due to a proportionally higher reduction of the power. Finally, the effect of the increase of the engine speed is positive on the CO and HCs emissions but negative on that of NOx due to improved mixing and higher temperature associated to intensified turbulence in the cylinders.

Tremendous efforts have been devoted to the optimization of the electrocatalytic performance of the catalysts under industrial-relevant current densities via rational structure design, which induces a preferential electron distribution that favors the adsorption/desorption behavior of the key intermediates, thus accelerating the reaction kinetics. In this review, a brief introduction of the current energy status will be first presented to necessitate the importance of green hydrogen. Followed by the basic concepts and fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanisms, we present efficient strategies for the enhancement of the electrocatalytic performance of the catalysts to meet the rigorous requirement under industrial conditions and the in-depth understanding behind the reinforcement will be briefly discussed next. Then the recent advances regarding the rational design of electrocatalysts operating at an industrial scale will be summarized.

J	Hickel, J; Slamersak, A				Hickel, Jason; Slamersak, Aljosa			Existing climate mitigation scenarios perpetuate colonial inequalities	LANCET PLANETARY HEALTH			English	Article								The challenge of climate mitigation is made more difficult by high rates of energy use in wealthy countries, mostly in the Global North, which far exceed what is required to meet human needs. In contrast, more than 3 billion people in poorer countries live in energy poverty. A just transition requires energy convergence-reducing energy use in wealthy countries to achieve rapid emissions reductions, and ensuring sufficient energy for development in the rest of the world. However, existing climate mitigation scenarios reviewed by The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change do not explore such a transition. On average, existing scenarios maintain the Global North's energy privilege at a per capita level 2.3 times higher than in the Global South. Even the more equitable scenarios perpetuate large energy inequalities for the rest of the century. To reconcile the Global North's high energy use with the Paris Agreement targets, most scenarios rely heavily on bioenergy-based negative emissions technologies. This approach is risky, but it is also unjust. These scenarios tend to appropriate land in the Global South to maintain, and further increase, the Global North's energy privilege. There is an urgent need to develop scenarios that represent convergence to levels of energy that are sufficient for human wellbeing and compatible with rapid decarbonisation.

J	Jung, J; Jayakrishnan, R; Choi, K				Jung, Jaeyoung; Jayakrishnan, R.; Choi, Keechoo			Dually sustainable urban mobility option: Shared-taxi operations with electric vehicles	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						Electric vehicles (EV); EV charging schemes; real-time shared taxi; vehicle routing algorithm	CHARGING STATIONS; SYSTEM; TRANSPORT; LOCATION; DESIGN	Electric vehicles (EVs) are energy efficient and often presented as a zero-emission transport mode to achieve long-term decarbonization visions in the transport sector. The implementation of a sustainable transportation environment through EV utilization, however, requires the addressing of certain cost and environmental concerns such as limited driving range and battery-charging issues before its full potential can be realized. Nevertheless, a specific type of use of EVs, namely in taxi services, may elicit positive public opinion, as it promises a commitment toward sustainability in urban life. In light of this, this study proposes an integrated approach that combines EV operation with a conceptual design for shared-ride taxi services. As some productivity loss may be naturally expected due to the time spent in charging, it is important to look at whether such performance loss from the passenger and system standpoints can be offset with ingenuity in operational design. In this study, an EV taxi charge-replenishing scheme that can be coupled with a real-time taxi-dispatch algorithm is designed. The proposed EV charging schemes for taxi services are studied via simulations and the effects of the limited driving range and battery-charging details are examined from a system performance viewpoint. The simulation study also reveals illustrative results on the impact of the EV taxi fleet's operation on the charging system. Next, a real-time shared-taxi operation scheme that allows ride sharing with other passengers is proposed to maximize the operational efficiency. The simulation results suggest that the shared-taxi concept can be a viable option to improve on the limitations caused by EV operation. In addition, the importance of projected charging demands and queue delays at different charging locations are also addressed. Some limitations and a future research agenda are also discussed.

This framework (i) describes the structural changes needed for a sustainable transition in food systems; (ii) assess their effects on employment at the farm and processing industry level; (iii) detect the political levers needed to make this transition a just one-that is, preserving jobs and livelihoods for communities. Using the decarbonation pathway for the agricultural sector issued from the French National Low-Carbon Strategy as reference, we developed two scenarios for the French dairy sector which have the same level of climate ambitious, but a different approach to reach the target. Aiming exclusively to achieve a greenhouse gases reduction, the first scenario relies only on supply side measures. This scenario has a negative impact in terms of employment loss at the farm level and in the agri-food sector. In contrast, a multifunctional scenario considering simultaneously climate, biodiversity, health, and employment issues, and playing with policy measures targeting supply, demand and market organisation can maintain jobs in the farm and agri-food sector, contributes to restore the agro-biodiversity and develops food products compatible with healthy nutritional guidelines.

In this study, we examine combustion instabilities in lean fully-premixed hydrogen-air flames in a mesoscale multinozzle array; little is currently known about how these flames respond to acoustic perturbations. Several measurement techniques, including phase-synchronized OH* chemiluminescence imaging, OH Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence, acoustic pressure, and the two microphone method, are used, together with reduced-order acoustic modeling, to identify the key physical properties of lean-premixed hydrogen-air flames, in comparison with lean-premixed methane-air flames. We show that extremely compact lean-premixed hydrogen flames are preferentially coupled to higher eigenmodes of a given system, L3 - L6, including approximately 1 kHz high-frequency instabilities, while the instabilities of methane-air flames are predominantly limited to the first longitudinal mode under the same range of operating conditions. This is attributed to the fact that the dynamics of the methane flames are governed by the collective motion of constituent flames, involving a complex process of the emergence, convection, and interaction of large-scale structures. By contrast, the hydrogen flames in the multinozzle configuration oscillate in isolation within a very short distance and without strong flameto-flame interactions. This is particularly suitable for accommodating high-frequency heat release modulations. The triggering of intense sound generation from lean-premixed mesoscale hydrogen flames is correlated strongly with a combination of flame surface destruction due to front merging and the flames' close proximity to a pressure antinode. These results, for the first time, highlight the key features of self-excited combustion instabilities of mesoscale multinozzle hydrogen-air flames in a well-controlled laboratory-scale experiment, and could pave the way for future carbon-neutral gas turbine combustion technology.

In this paper, we explore how to make compatible markets principles, economic signals and grid development through the analysis of the grid-related costs associated with the connection of new renewables. Starting from the actual locational patterns of the transmission congestions as baseline, we evaluate the locational impacts, the corresponding network investments and electricity losses associated with the introduction of new renewable (wind and solar) capacity and facing out existent (coal and nuclear) in a real electricity system. Simulated geographical scenarios following the Spanish National Energy and Climate Plan are used to explore up to what extent the potential locations of new generation plants might result in congestions that require relevant grid reinforcements and extra electricity losses, both borne by consumers. We show how the location of future renewables is highly relevant from the private and social perspectives. Moreover, the future incurred costs for consumers might be much higher if the regulatory framework does not provide the right incentives for all the agents, specially the entrants: renewable promoters. These higher costs could also trade-off other benefits related to renewables: decarbonization of electricity, impacts on wholesale prices, etc. From our results, policy recommendations are provided with the aim to face the market failure related to the location of new renewables.

This paper provides insights from semi-structured interviews with 31 UK experts from government, industry, academia, and civil society. Participants were asked for their views on the major uncertainties surrounding the ability of the UK to meet its 2050 climate targets. The research reveals a range of views on the most critical uncertainties, how they can be mitigated, and how the research community can develop approaches to better support strategic decision-making. The study finds that the socio-political dimensions of uncertainty are discussed by experts almost as frequently as technological ones, but that there exist divergent perspectives on the role of government in the transition and whether or not there is a requirement for increased societal engagement. Finally, the study finds that decision-makers require a new approach to uncertainty assessment that overcomes analytical limits to existing practice, is more flexible and adaptable, and which better integrates qualitative narratives with quantitative analysis. Policy design must escape from 'caged' thinking concerning what can or cannot be included in models, and therefore what types of uncertainties can or cannot be explored.	[Li, Francis G.

Susceptibility to climate change is modulated by biological, ecological and socio-political factors such as age, gender, geographic location, socio-economic status, occupation, health status and housing conditions, among other.In the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East (EMME), climatic factors known to affect human health include extreme heat, water shortages and air pollution. Furthermore, the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases (VBDs) and the health consequences of population displacement are also influenced by climate change in this region.To inform future policies for adaptation and mitigation measures, and based on an extensive review of the available knowledge, we recommend several research priorities for the region. These include the generation of more empirical evidence on exposure-response functions involving climate change and specific health outcomes, the development of appropriate methodologies to evaluate the physical and psychological effects of climate change on vulnerable populations, determining how climate change alters the ecological determinants of human health, improving our understanding of the effects of long-term exposure to heat stress and air pollution, and evaluating the interactions between adaptation and mitigation strategies.Because national boundaries do not limit most climate-related factors expected to impact human health, we propose that adaptation/mitigation policies must have a regional scope, and therefore require collaborative efforts among EMME nations. Policy suggestions include a decisive region-wide decarbonisation, the integration of environmentally driven morbidity and mortality data throughout the region, advancing the development and widespread use of affordable technologies for the production and management of drinking water by non-traditional means, the development of comprehensive strategies to improve the health status of displaced populations, and fostering regional networks for monitoring and controlling the spread of infectious diseases and disease vectors.

J	Welton, S				Welton, Shelley			Neutralizing the Atmosphere	YALE LAW JOURNAL			English	Article							COST-BENEFIT-ANALYSIS; CARBON OFFSETS; REDD PLUS; CLIMATE; ADDITIONALITY; POLICY; RESILIENCE; FRACKING; SERVICES; BANKING	"Net zero " has rapidly become the new organizing paradigm of climate change law. In the past few years, thousands of countries, companies, states, and cities have developed pledges that promise by a set date-typically around 2050-that any carbon they emit will be counterbalanced by capturing an equal amount of carbon out of the atmosphere. Collectively, these pledges now cover more than 91% of the global economy. This widespread adoption of scientifically aligned climate policy appears on its surface like a cause for celebration. However, concerns are mounting. To date, critiques of net zero have centered on what this Feature terms "accounting " risks: that is, risks that pledges in action will fail to live up to pledges on paper. This Feature argues that there are two broader normative and political risks with net zero that are underdiagnosed but may prove more intractable. First, the net-zero framework is agnostic regarding the manner in which to neutralize atmospheric emissions, leaving each participating entity-including both governments and corporations-to determine its own preferred strategy. But decisions around how to reach net-zero emissions are contested, impactful, and often politically explosive. As net zero has proliferated as a framing paradigm, there has been a marked shift in the climate change policy conversation towards recognizing climate as imbricated with racial and economic justice. These considerations are ignored in the net-zero framing, with its emphasis on pristine carbon balance sheets. The second risk this Feature identifies is the "collective-achievement challenge ": if the world continues to pursue an atomized approach to net zero, it is likely that entities will overrely on certain cost-effective strategies-like tree planting-at scales that cannot be collectively achieved, at least not without substantial collateral social consequences. Disjunctive efforts toward net zero thus threaten to undermine the legal, political, and physical foundations of global decarbonization efforts. Understanding these risks counsels for restructuring the private sector's role away from individualized net-zero targets toward a "reduce and sup-port " approach that would better collectivize and rationalize net-zero policy. For public pledges, these risks counsel for more attention to net zero's administering institutions and governance structures to foster more democratic, holistic decision-making about the shape and content of our decarbonized future.

Santos; Alves, Marco			Hydrogen production from the WindFloat Atlantic offshore wind farm: A techno-economic analysis	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Hydrogen production feasibility; PEM electrolysis; Wind energy; WindFloat Atlantic	ENERGY; OPTIMIZATION; PERFORMANCE; PLANT; COST	Green hydrogen production is expected to have a major contribution in addressing the global challenge of energy transition and economy decarbonization. In such a transition, wind energy is considered as one of the principal electricity sources for H-2 production, both because it is a sustainable source and owing to the intermittency of the wind resource. In recent years, new wind farms have gradually moved offshore, due to better wind resource quality and due to limited space onshore. However, a mismatch between instantaneous wind energy availability and electricity demand often leads to wasting some of the wind resource, usually referred to as curtailment events. Such an excess energy could be used to produce hydrogen and thus make efficient and integrated use of the available equipment and resources. The present work analyzes the feasibility of hydrogen production employing electricity generated from wind energy, taking the WindFloat Atlantic offshore wind farm and Portugal's electricity market as a case-study. Two scenarios are considered. Scenario 1 assumes the WindFloat Atlantic wind farm's present capacity of 25.2 MW and scenario 2 considers a long-term commercial phase of 150 MW integrated in a developed hydrogen economy with pipelines for H2 distribution. In both scenarios a readily available PEM electrolyzer system is employed and the benefits of complementary oxygen sales are estimated. The availability of the wind resource and occurrence of different wind conditions for the particular location is estimated from the wind energy atlas. Afterwards, correlations between the renewable energy production and wholesale electricity price in the Iberian market are established by processing the data corresponding to the year 2019 and taking seasonal variations into account. For each of scenarios, two cases are considered. Case A assumes hydrogen is produced only at night whereas Case B allows for production both during nights and afternoons. Results show Case B and oxygen sales contribute to a more economically feasible project. For Case B and assuming a H-2 selling price of 8 e/kg, discount rate (10%) and corporate tax of 21%, results show scenario 2 is the only profitable solution, due to the long-term lower costs. Scenario 1 appears to be feasible only with government incentives. The ratio between the hydrogen plant power and wind farm capacity (PPR) has a significant impact on the H-2 production, with results showing a minimum in H-2 cost for a ratio of approximately 30%.

In addition, by connecting different geographical zones, the transmission network could smooth the intermittency and the variability of renewable energy production. Thus, the changing energy landscape leads to a need to reinforce the transmission network through the Network Transmission Expansion Planning. Ideally, all the idiosyncrasies of the electricity system are considered in the operation and expansion planning process. However, several critical dimensions of the planning process are routinely ignored since they may introduce parameters that are difficult to quantify and complexity that state-of-the-art planning methods cannot handle. This paper identifies the most relevant elements related to the human factor, which have been grouped around the main topics: the human behind the technical, the human at the institutional level, and the human at the individual level. This paper also provides an additional formulation that can be used to upgrade existing models to include the human element and discusses the implications of these upgrades.

Climate consequences of hydrogen emissions	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							NATURAL-GAS; IMPACT; ECONOMY; LEAKAGE	Given the urgency to decarbonize global energy systems, governments and industry are moving ahead with efforts to increase deployment of hydrogen technologies, infrastructure, and applications at an unprecedented pace, including USD billions in national incentives and direct investments. While zero- and low-carbon hydrogen hold great promise to help solve some of the world's most pressing energy challenges, hydrogen is also an indirect greenhouse gas whose warming impact is both widely overlooked and underestimated. This is largely because hydrogen's atmospheric warming effects are short-lived - lasting only a couple decades - but standard methods for characterizing climate impacts of gases consider only the long-term effect from a one-time pulse of emissions. For gases whose impacts are short-lived, like hydrogen, this long-term framing masks a much stronger warming potency in the near to medium term. This is of concern because hydrogen is a small molecule known to easily leak into the atmosphere, and the total amount of emissions (e.g., leakage, venting, and purging) from existing hydrogen systems is unknown. Therefore, the effectiveness of hydrogen as a decarbonization strategy, especially over timescales of several decades, remains unclear. This paper evaluates the climate consequences of hydrogen emissions over all timescales by employing already published data to assess its potency as a climate forcer, evaluate the net warming impacts from replacing fossil fuel technologies with their clean hydrogen alternatives, and estimate temperature responses to projected levels of hydrogen demand. We use the standard global warming potential metric, given its acceptance to stakeholders, and incorporate newly published equations that more fully capture hydrogen's several indirect effects, but we consider the effects of constant rather than pulse emissions over multiple time horizons. We account for a plausible range of hydrogen emission rates and include methane emissions when hydrogen is produced via natural gas with carbon capture, usage, and storage (CCUS) ("blue" hydrogen) as opposed to renewables and water ("green" hydrogen). For the first time, we show the strong timescale dependence when evaluating the climate change mitigation potential of clean hydrogen alternatives, with the emission rate determining the scale of climate benefits or disbenefits. For example, green hydrogen applications with higher-end emission rates (10 %) may only cut climate impacts from fossil fuel technologies in half over the first 2 decades, which is far from the common perception that green hydrogen energy systems are climate neutral. However, over a 100-year period, climate impacts could be reduced by around 80 %. On the other hand, lower-end emissions (1 %) could yield limited impacts on the climate over all timescales. For blue hydrogen, associated methane emissions can make hydrogen applications worse for the climate than fossil fuel technologies for several decades if emissions are high for both gases; however, blue hydrogen yields climate benefits over a 100-year period. While more work is needed to evaluate the warming impact of hydrogen emissions for specific end-use cases and value-chain pathways, it is clear that hydrogen emissions matter for the climate and warrant further attention from scientists, industry, and governments. This is critical to informing where and how to deploy hydrogen effectively in the emerging decarbonized global economy.

J	Stala-Szlugaj, K; Grudzinski, Z				Stala-Szlugaj, Katarzyna; Grudzinski, Zbigniew			World steam coal management	GOSPODARKA SUROWCAMI MINERALNYMI-MINERAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						steam coal; trade; exports; imports		The article analyzes trends in steam coal flows (exports and imports) linked to production and consumption volumes. The analysis carried out in the article took the years from 2000 to 2019 into consideration. Coal is the second most important energy carrier. Its share in the structure of global consumption amounts to 27% and its production has an upward trend despite its decreasing share. The overall global upward trend of steam coal flows was disrupted twice over the period 2000-2019: by the effects of the 2007-2009 global financial crisis and the ongoing uncertainty of the global economy, as well as by the significant slowdown in the economic growth of developing countries (2014-2016). The European Union has seen large decreases in coal consumption over recent years, reflecting an accelerating decarbonization policy. The main area of coal trade is the Asia-Pacific basin. The Mantic market currently accounts for about 20% of global steam coal trade, with seaborne trade covering about 95%. The volume of world trade (exports, imports) in steam coal is approximately one billion (bn) tons per year. The analysis carried out showed the following trend: decreasing coal exports to economically developed countries (mainly concentrated in Europe) and increasing exports to economies of developing countries, concentrated in the Asian part of the world. International Energy Agency (TEA) projections show that by 2040 the global coal production will fall from 5.6bn tons of coal equivalent (3.9bn tons of oil equivalent in 2019) to 5bn tce (3.5bn toe) at an average annual rate of -1.1%. Steam coal production is expected to decline by 10% to 4bn tce (2.8bn toe). Due to the fact that China is the largest producer, user and importer of steam coal in the world, all economic and political decisions taken by its government have strongly influenced international coal trade for years. For the Asia-Pacific basin alone, the TEA's long-term forecasts predict an increase in coal-fired power generation over 2019. Forecasts regarding the coal's share in global demand are not optimistic for many regions of the world (Europe, Africa, the Americas), predicting a significant decline in its demand. Yet, new markets for coal are emerging, especially in Asia and the Mediterranean basin, which may contribute to maintaining at least the current level of coal trade.

Knowledge claims in European Union energy policies: Unknown knowns and uncomfortable awareness	ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Uncomfortable knowledge; Unknown knowns; Knowledge claims; Energy analysis; Energy policy; Post -normal science	SCIENCE; EXPECTATIONS; UNCERTAINTY; COMPLEXITY; TRAGEDY	Despite the concerted efforts of the scientific community and politicians to contain greenhouse gas emissions, the CO2 level in the atmosphere continues to increase monotonically. This raises the question whether the scientific representations and related knowledge claims used to inform energy policy have been incomplete or incorrect. Are there alternative relevant knowledge claims that have been overlooked or ignored in the discussion of energy policies and if so, why? We answer these questions by elaborating three case studies, energy efficiency im-provements, liquid biofuels, and decarbonization of electricity, and using a novel procedure for quality checking policy narratives that is based in post-normal science and developed in the EU project Moving Towards Adaptive Governance in Complexity: Informing NEXUS Security (MAGIC). The focus of our approach is on the coherence of the why (concerns or justifications), what ( "solution "), and how ( "scientific evidence ") of energy policies. We show that for all cases studied alternative knowledge claims, mostly derived from the relatively new field of non -equilibrium thermodynamics, would be available for better informing energy policy, but that they are unknown knowns in the chosen framing of the issues. We conclude that the idea that the various concerns identified in EU energy policy can be solved simultaneously is unrealistic. This idea can only persist by virtue of banishing un-comfortable knowledge and the creation of implausible socio-technical imaginaries. When considering different aspects of the problem and integrating different narratives and knowledge claims, a smooth and painless tran-sition to a zero-carbon economy seems unlikely.

Most research in this area quantifies impacts on one or a few components and does not link these impacts to effects on power system planning and operations. Here, we advance the understanding of how climate change might impact the bulk U.S. power system in three ways. First, we synthesize recent research to capture likely component-level impacts of climate change in the United States. Second, given the interconnected nature of the electric power system, we assess how aggregated component-level impacts might affect power system planning and operations. Third, we outline an agenda for future research on climate change impacts on power system planning and operations. Although component-level impacts vary in their magnitude, collectively they might significantly affect planning and operations. Most notably, increased demand plus reduced firm capacity across generation types might require systems to procure significant additional capacity to maintain planning reserve margins, and regional declines in renewable resources might need to be offset by increasing zero-carbon investment to meet decarbonization targets. Aggregated impacts might also affect operations, e.g., through shifts in dispatching and increased operational reserve requirements. Future research should aggregate component-level impacts at operational timescales, quantify impacts on wind and solar variability, and contextualize climate change impacts within ongoing shifts in the electric power system.

The design of district heating often has competing objectives: the need for inexpensive energy and meeting low carbon targets. In addition, the planning of district heating schemes is subject to multiple sources of uncertainty, such as variability in heat demand and energy prices. This paper proposes a decision support tool to analyse and compare system designs for district heating under uncertainty using stochastic ordering (dominance) so that decision-makers can make robust decisions. The uncertainty in input parameters of the energy system model together with general scenarios are introduced to generate distributions of net present costs and emissions for each design. To perform inference about the induced distributions of outputs, we apply the orderings in the mean and dispersion. The proposed approach is demonstrated in an application to the waste heat recovery problem in district heating in Brunswick, Germany. The results obtained show that heat pump, a low carbon design option, is more robust in comparison to combined heat and power (CHP) and a mix of CHP and heat pump under all three scenarios, highlighting that robustness is an attractive feature of low-temperature waste heat recovery.

Microbial electrosynthesis (MES) has emerged as a promising technology to promote this transition, which will further benefit from the decreasing cost of renewable energy. However, several technological challenges need to be addressed before the MES technology can reach its maturity. The aim of this review is to critically discuss the bottlenecks hampering the industrial adoption of MES, considering the whole production process (from the CO2 source to the marketable products), and indicate future directions. A flexible stack design, with flat or tubular MES modules and direct CO2 supply, is required for site-specific decentralised applications. The experience gained for scaling-up electrochemical cells (e.g. electrolysers) can serve as a guideline for realising pilot MES stacks to be technologically and economically evaluated in industrially relevant conditions. Maximising CO2 abatement rate by targeting high-rate production of acetate can promote adoption of MES technology in the short term. However, the development of a replicable and robust strategy for production and in-line extraction of higher-value products (e.g. caproic acid and hexanol) at the cathode, and meaningful exploitation of the currently overlooked anodic reactions, can further boost MES cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, the use of energy storage and smart electronics can alleviate the fluctuations of renewable energy supply. Despite the unresolved challenges, the flexible MES technology can be applied to decarbonise flue gas from different sources, to upgrade industrial and wastewater treatment plants, and to produce a wide array of green and sustainable chemicals. The combination of these benefits can support the industrial adoption of MES over competing technologies.	[Dessi, Paolo; Dinesh, G.

Evidence from China	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						China; External cost; Internal cost; Ground source heat pump system; Life cycle assessment	LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; ENERGY; FEASIBILITY; MITIGATION; EMISSION; IMPACTS	The application potential and environmental benefits of ground source heat pump (GSHP) systems have become the focal points of decarbonization in the building sector. Synchronized and scientific analysis of GSHP systems' environmental and economic performance, however, remains lacking. This study analyzes the application prospects of GSHP systems via a life cycle assessment-based life cycle costing method, and considers China's actual status quo. The internal and external annual costs of a GSHP system per square meter are $ 4.05 and $ 1.37, respectively. Electricity generation and steel production are key processes to improve the environmental performance of a GSHP system further. Compared with coal-based heating, a GSHP system can mitigate 65%-95% of the environmental impact and 85% of external costs, except for the metal depletion impact which is 1.5 times higher than that of coal-based heating. In Shandong Province, promoting GSHP systems can substitute up to 69.4% of the district heating area, which implies reductions in fossil depletion, greenhouse gas emissions, human health impact, ecosystem quality impact, and external costs by up to 2.37 x 10(10) kg oil eq, 1.08 x 10(11) kg CO2 eq, 3.87 x 10(5) DALY, 1.18 x 10(3) Species. year, and $ 2.51 x 10(10), respectively. In consideration of environmental and economic aspects, a GSHP system can exhibit benefits compared with coal-based heating after 2.34 years of operation. To improve the economic and environmental performance of GSHP systems, a series of recommendations on financial subsidies, renewable energy development, inter-regional power transmission, steel scrap utilization, and hydrogen reduction steelmaking is provided.

This paper describes a model, provided in full online, to undertake scenario analysis on the cost and CO2 emissions impact of substituting current vehicle drivetrain types with alternatives during the period 2010-2050. A detailed decomposition of the additional costs and CO2 emissions savings of each low-carbon vehicle type into their component parts is undertaken to calculate the marginal abatement cost of each vehicle and drivetrain type in 2050. The results indicate that passenger cars and heavy-duty trucks constitute the majority of future CO2 emissions savings potential, but that, using the central cost assumptions, alternative vehicle drivetrains are significantly more cost-effective for trucks than passenger cars. The low-carbon scenario sees demand for oil products (gasoline and diesel) more than 40% below the business-as-usual scenario in 2050. The total mitigation cost in 2050 is (US2010)$64 billion per year, or 1.3% of the total annual expenditure on road transport in China in 2050, using a discount rate of 5% to annualise vehicle purchase costs, although this cost increases with higher discount rates. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates that measures in addition to those assumed in the low-carbon scenario could achieve further emissions reductions, in some cases at negative costs. The availability and transparency of the model allows testing and development of a range of further scenarios and sensitivities, to aid in planning an optimal decarbonisation strategy for this highly carbon-intensive sector.

However, little is known about how the conflicts between governmental goals and socialpsychological factors influence the rural villagers' decision to adopt solar photovoltaics. Using integrated agency and structural theories, a survey was conducted of 1247 low-income households in rural China to determine the locals' solar adoption intention. Our results suggest that economic motivations, environmental concerns, and the desire to improve China's national image are the strongest predictors of adoption, followed by descriptive norms, motivations, expected lifestyle change, knowledge, and frequency of communication. Conflicts between "national vs. community concerns" can make villagers less willing to embrace solar technology. Among the negative predictors, feeling pressured by the government is the strongest, followed by a sense of community, energy behavioral control, and social sanctions. As villagers' sense of community increased, solar adoption intention first increased and then decreased. Overall, the locals have a strong desire for independence and are unwilling to follow the government's policies blindly, while responding positively to solar energy promotion from respected local community leaders. These findings have key policy implications for minimizing the conflicts between national and local authorities in promoting renewable energy, especially by softening the energy transition governance process through stressing social psychology and inclusive policy-making.

Existing transmission capacity is, however, a limiting factor in expanding hydropower imports to the region. To examine the value of expanding transmission capacity from Quebec to the Northeast, we employ an integrated top-down bottom-up modeling framework (USREP-EleMod). This research was part of an Energy Modeling Forum effort, EMF34, with a goal of better characterizing linkages in energy markets across North America. The scenarios we examine exogenously expand transmission capacity by 10, 30, and 50% above existing capacity into the US Northeast (New York/New England), finding the value to the economy of these expansions ranging from $.38$.49 per kWh imported into New York, and $.30-$.33 per kWh imported into New England by 2050. The scenarios include economy-wide emissions goals these states have set for themselves. The carbon limits we imposed raise fuel prices more than electricity prices and as a result we found greater electrification in the US Northeast region from 2030 onward, a result that one would not see using just an electricity sector model, demonstrating a main hypothesis of EMF34, that models that looked at more integration across energy markets would give deeper insight than more narrowly focused models.

Clean energy and the hydrogen economy	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES			English	Editorial Material						hydrogen; energy; fuel cell	GAS; STORAGE; DECARBONISATION	In recent years, new-found interest in the hydrogen economy from both industry and academia has helped to shed light on its potential. Hydrogen can enable an energy revolution by providing much needed flexibility in renewable energy systems. As a clean energy carrier, hydrogen offers a range of benefits for simultaneously decarbonizing the transport, residential, commercial and industrial sectors. Hydrogen is shown here to have synergies with other low-carbon alternatives, and can enable a more cost-effective transition to de-carbonized and cleaner energy systems. This paper presents the opportunities for the use of hydrogen in key sectors of the economy and identifies the benefits and challenges within the hydrogen supply chain for power-to-gas, power-to-power and gas-to-gas supply pathways. While industry players have already started the market introduction of hydrogen fuel cell systems, including fuel cell electric vehicles and micro-combined heat and power devices, the use of hydrogen at grid scale requires the challenges of clean hydrogen production, bulk storage and distribution to be resolved. Ultimately, greater government support, in partnership with industry and academia, is still needed to realize hydrogen's potential across all economic sectors. This article is part of the themed issue 'The challenges of hydrogen and metals'.	[Brandon, N.

Among different decarbonisation strategies, knowledge about the potential role and contributions of social movements to curbing carbon emissions has been limited. This study aims to shed light on the diverse contributions of social movements to staying within the global carbon budget, as well as on the specific outcomes and strategies employed in protests against hydrocarbon activities. For this purpose, we conduct a systematic literature review of 57 empirical cases of social movements contesting fossil fuel projects in 29 countries. Based on an exploratory approach, we identify a series of different movement strategies and a range of qualitative contributions that support staying within the carbon budget. These include raising awareness of risks and strategies, enhancing corporate responsibility, being informed about policy changes, laws and regulations, fostering just energy transitions, energy democracy, divestment, alternative market solutions, and forcing the postponement or cancellation of targeted hydrocarbon activities. While the institutional means are widely used and seem to support policy change and regulation, these strategies are not used to deliver awareness or postponement outcomes. Similarly, while movements tend to rely on civil disobedience to stop hydrocarbon projects in the short term, they rely on multiple strategies to cancel them in the longer term. Our study also indicates significant knowledge gaps in the literature, particularly, cases in Africa and Central Asia, women's participation in these movements, in addition to more quantitative assessments of the actual emissions reduced by social movements.

Production Cost and Carbon Footprint of Biomass-Derived Dimethylcyclooctane as a High-Performance Jet Fuel Blendstock	ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING			English	Article						biomass sorghum; ionic liquid; lignocellulosic sugar; isoprenol; sustainable aviation fuel; technoeconomic analysis; life-cycle assessment	CYCLE GREENHOUSE-GAS; WATER-INTENSITY; ISOPENTENOL; CONVERSION; RUBBER	Near- term decarbonization of aviation requires energy-dense, renewable liquid fuels. Biomass-derived 1,4-dimethyl-cyclooctane (DMCO), a cyclic alkane with a volumetric net heat of combustion up to 9.2% higher than Jet A, has the potential to serve as a low-carbon, high-performance jet fuel blendstock that may enable paraffinic bio-jet fuels to operate without aromatic compounds. DMCO can be produced from bio-derived isoprenol (3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol) through a multistep upgrading process. This study presents detailed process configurations for DMCO production to estimate the minimum selling price and life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint considering three different hydrogenation catalysts and two bioconversion pathways. The platinum-based catalyst offers the lowest production cost and GHG footprint of $9.0/L-Jet-A(eq) and 61.4 gCO(2e)/MJ, given the current state of technology. However, when the supply chain and process are optimized, hydrogenation with a Raney nickel catalyst is preferable, resulting in a $1.5/L-Jet-A(eq) cost and 18.3 gCO(2e)/MJ GHG footprint if biomass sorghum is the feedstock. This price point requires dramatic improvements, including 28 metric-ton/ha sorghum yield and 95-98% of the theoretical maximum conversion of biomass-to-sugars, sugars-to-isoprenol, isoprenol-to-isoprene, and isoprene-to-DMCO. Because increased gravimetric energy density of jet fuels translates to reduced aircraft weight, DMCO also has the potential to improve aircraft efficiency, particularly on long-haul flights.

In 2020, when the ongoing Covid-19 global pandemic spread across the world, it brought economic instability in its wake. Sectors of the built environment (BE), among others, were hit hard by a public health crisis followed swiftly by an unprecedented economic downturn. In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report highlighted the need for rapid and drastic action on climate change by 2030 to prevent the disastrous effects of a world warmed by more than 1.5 degrees C above preindustrial levels, raising the urgency of achieving the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by Member States in 2015. Even rapid decarbonisation, the report warned, would likely not be sufficient to address the intertwined problems of poverty, mass migration, politics and ecological collapse that the SDGs seek to address. Digital technology offers an opportunity to better understand and model solutions to these complex crises, but it is unclear how digital technology should be harnessed in the face of an uncertain future. Written at the beginning of this critical decade leading up to 2030, this paper looks ahead 20 years in the future to better understand the resources, technology, economy, governance, infrastructure, mobility and social factors that may shape the development of Britain's digital BE. By exploring four scenarios around the variables of i) the UK's compliance with the interconnected targets of the SDGs and ii) the size of the workforce relative to the dependent population (dependency), this paper concludes with the identification of key strategies that can lead to the sustainable development of the BE sectors, outlining a number of actions that should be combined with the path for recovery from Covid-19 and are based on digital technology and a green information economy that ensures a future better for everyone in a digital built Britain.

Alkali-treated HZSM-5 contains considerable amounts of non-framework (amorphous) Lewis acidic Al species on the external surface, and is deemed to be essential in affecting its catalytic performances. This study intends to clarify the catalytic nature of amorphous Al species of alkali-treated HZSM-5 in methanol aromatization. Physicochemical characterizations, including N-2 adsorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), magic-angle-spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR), inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis, NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), and methanol-TPD, were performed. The outcomes showed that non-framework Al promotes the hydride transfer in mesoporous HZSM-5, thereby facilitating the aromatization reaction. Among aromatic products, durene can be promoted by non-framework Al through methylation/transalkylation of other aromatics, particularly xylenes, instead of being promoted by reduced space confinement in mesoporous HZSM-5.

J	Sajadi, A; Kenyon, RW; Hodge, BM				Sajadi, Amirhossein; Kenyon, Rick Wallace; Hodge, Bri-Mathias			Synchronization in electric power networks with inherent heterogeneity up to 100% inverter-based renewable generation	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							STABILITY	Modern power grids undergo a transition due to the integration of renewable energy generation technologies that bring heterogeneity in the grid. The authors study the synchronization and stability of power grids with heterogeneous inertia and damping factors, and demonstrate power feasibility of operating a system consisting of only renewable generation technologies with enhanced stability. The synchronized operation of power generators is the foundation of electric power network stability and a key to the prevention of undesired power outages and blackouts. Here, we derive the conditions that guarantee synchronization in power networks with inherent generator heterogeneity when subjected to small perturbations, and perform a parametric sensitivity analysis to understand synchronization with varied types of generators. As inverter-based resources, which are the primary interfacing technology for many renewable sources of energy, have supplanted synchronous generators in ever growing numbers, the center of attention on associated integration challenges have resided primarily on the role of declining system inertia. Our results instead highlight the critical role of generator damping in achieving a stable state of synchronization. Additionally, we report the feasibility of operating interconnected electric grids with up to 100% power contribution from inverter-based renewable generation technologies. Our study has important implications as it sets the basis for the development of advanced control architectures and grid optimization methods that ensure synchronization and further pave the path towards the decarbonization of the electric power sector.

J	Smith, SR; Christie, I				Smith, Steven R.; Christie, Ian			Knowledge Integration in the Politics and Policy of Rapid Transitions to Net Zero Carbon: A Typology and Mapping Method for Climate Actors in the UK	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						climate; actors; mitigation; politics; policy; rapid; transition; transformation; typology; mapping	ENERGY TRANSITIONS; SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; DECARBONIZATION; DEMOCRACY; STATE	The types of political and policy knowledge required to guide rapid transition to low-carbon economies remain largely disconnected in the fields of political science, psychology, and sociology. The composition and key features of the main actors involved, and their relationships have also not been systematically described. This paper attempts to address these knowledge gaps by proposing a new, integrative typology of actors involved in climate change mitigation policy in the United Kingdom (UK) and a method for mapping these actors and selecting their typological descriptors onto a 2D space. The mapping method enables stakeholders to visualise and evaluate the strength of support for the UK government's net-zero-by-2050 "green growth" strategy and the tensions, challenges, and strategic opportunities potentially facing more radical alternatives. The methodology could be replicated for climate actors in other countries and, in principle, for any geographical scale or level of governance.

The need for functional nanohybrid materials based on photo- and electroactive materials and accessible raw materials is high in the field of solar fuels. To reach this goal, single-step synthesis of {Ta6Br12i}@GO (GO = graphene oxide) nanohybrids was developed by immobilization of [{Ta6Br12i}Br-2(a)(H2O)(a)(4)]center dot 4H(2)O (i = inner and a = apical positions of the Ta-6 octahedron) on GO nanosheets by taking the advantage of the easy ligand exchange of the apical cluster ligands with the oxygen functionalities of GO. The nanohybrids were characterized by spectroscopic, analytical, and morphological techniques. The hybrid formation enhances the yield of photocatalytic H-2 from water with respect to their precursors and this is without the presence of precious metals. This enhancement is attributed to the optimal cluster loading onto the GO support and the crucial role of GO in the electron transfer from Ta-6 clusters into GO sheets, thus suppressing the charge recombination. In view of the simplicity and versatility of the designed photocatalytic system, octahedral tantalum clusters are promising candidates to develop new and environmentally friendly photocatalysts for H-2 evolution.

Seawater is the most abundant water source on Earth, and it should be the feedstock for these new technologies. However, commercial electrolyzers still need ultrapure water. The debate over the advantages and disadvantages of direct sea water electrolysis when compared with the implementation of a distillation/purification process before the electrolysis stage is building in the relevant research. However, this debate will remain open for some time, essentially because there are no seawater electrolyser technologies with which to compare the modular approach. In this study, we attempted to build and validate an autonomous sea water electrolyzer able to produce high-purity green hydrogen (>90%) from seawater. We were able to solve most of the problems that natural seawater electrolyses imposes (high corrosion, impurities, etc.), with decisions based on simplicity and sustainability, and those issues that are yet to be overcome were rationally discussed in view of future electrolyzer designs. Even though the performance we achieved may still be far from industrial standards, our results demonstrate that direct seawater electrolysis with a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of approximate to 7% can be achieved with common, low-cost materials and affordable fabrication methods.

Renewable thennal energy systems (RTES) could be hybridized with different renewable options e.g., fiat plate collectors with parabolic trough collectors, or combined with existing heat supplies (e.g., fossil fuels), to give options for targeted SIPII applications, industrial decarbonization and the reduction of fuel consumption. Hybrid solutions and thermal energy storage will be important for the dispatch of heat at optimal times needed by the demand side of the buildings and industrial applications. At present, there is no integrated modeling tool for hybrid RIES, and this paper highlights the development of a renewable thennal hybridization framework for IPH use that is built from existing tools like System Advisor Model. The long-term vision for the framework (through significant further research) is to develop a coupled hybrid energy generation and cost analysis tool, where the tool could help the user in determining the most suitable and cost-effective technologies for their applications. Ongoing work will look to add costs for RTES options and further refinement on the selection of suitable technologies. This future tool could calculate the levelized cost of heat of various RTES hybrid options, by taking the user's solar resource, fuel costs, industrial heat demand profile, available land, and other factors into account to determine the applicability into their process.

J	Sanchez, A; Castellano, E; Martin, M; Vega, P				Sanchez, Antonio; Castellano, Elena; Martin, Mariano; Vega, Pastora			Evaluating ammonia as green fuel for power generation: A thermo-chemical perspective	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Ammonia combustion; Energy storage; Green ammonia; Power-to-X; Power generation; Renewable fuels	ENERGY-STORAGE; CYCLE; GAS; FEASIBILITY; HYDROGEN; EMISSIONS; DESIGN; SCALE; WATER; DECOMPOSITION	Energy storage will be necessary for a future power system with high penetration of renewable sources, mainly, wind and solar, to ensure the stability of the grid. In this context, power-to-chemicals is a promising concept for a medium/long-term storage horizon and a wide range of capacities. Within this alternative, ammonia rises as one of the fuels with the highest potential in a scenario targeting decarbonization. The first step is the production of ammonia using renewable energy sources, followed by its transformation into energy. This second area requires a deeper analysis at process scale in order to introduce this technology into the future power system. In this work, an assessment of an ammonia-based power plant is presented, focusing on the thermo-chemical route. A combined cycle is evaluated, considering different gas clean-up technologies to recover valuable components and comply with environmental restrictions. As a result, the total efficiency of the power facility reaches about 40%, limited by the maximum temperature allowed in the gas turbine. The influence of the price of ammonia is also evaluated due to the paramount importance of this parameter. The production cost ranges from 0.2 to 0.6 euro/kWh, with the lowest level corresponding to a scenario in which there is a significant reduction in the cost of renewable power generation and electrolysis technology. Therefore, the feasibility of the use of ammonia as an energy storage alternative is demonstrated, providing a powerful platform for the implementation of a power grid with high penetration of fluctuating sources.

A geographical approach	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Review						Solar energy; Global horizontal irradiation; Direct normal irradiation; Solar resources; Photovoltaic systems; Concentrating solar power systems; Global analysis	DIRECT NORMAL IRRADIANCE; RENEWABLE ENERGY; SUSTAINABLE ENERGY; POWER-GENERATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ELECTRICITY-GENERATION; RESOURCE ASSESSMENT; SATELLITE DATA; THERMAL POWER; CHINA	Solar energy is a key renewable source for decarbonization and the future sustainable development of human society. However, the success of the worldwide governments in the large-scale implementation of solar technologies largely depends on the in-depth knowledge of global solar radiation distribution and intensity levels, which is a difficult endeavour due to the fact that up-to-date global-scale information is generally limited. This study primarily aims to analyse solar radiation distribution and intensity globally, continentally (all continents, except for Antarctica) and nationally (194 countries), based on the global horizontal irradiation (GHI) and direct normal irradiation (DNI) data, released at the best spatial resolution currently available in reliable international databases. By means of a statistical analysis of seven potential classes, delimited based on established geostatistical methods, the results showed that, globally, there are 6 major CHI hotspots (western South America, northern, eastern and southwestern Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and Australia), with annual values of >2200 kWh/m(2), and 6 other well-defined DNI hotspots (southwestern North America, western South America, southwestern Africa, northwestern Arabian Peninsula, Tibetan Plateau and Australia), with values of >2500 kWh/m(2). These regions, with the most intense solar radiation values, assigned to the seventh potential class (superb) of the two parameters, comprise most of the total global GHI (similar to 15 mil km(2),10% of the world's land area) and DNI (similar to 8 mil km(2), 5%) superb class areas. Continentally, Africa holds the most considerable GHI solar resources (almost 10 mil km(2) of the superb class, approximately one third of the continental area), while Australia holds the most abundant DNI resources (similar to 4 mil km(2), similar to 50%). Nationally, there are 12 epicentre countries for GHI, considering at least 50% superb potential threshold within national limits (9 in Africa - Namibia, 96%, Sudan, 86%, Niger, 84%, Egypt, 77%, Western Sahara, 72%, Chad, 69%, Eritrea, 58%, Libya, 56%, and Djibouti, 52%, and 3 in Asia - Oman, 92%, Yemen, 87%, and Saudi Arabia, 74%), while for DNI only 3 countries reach this percentual threshold of the maximum solar potential (Namibia, 77%, Jordan, 53%, and Australia, 51%). Our results suggest these epicentre countries (as well as others with extensive absolute GHI and DNI superb class areas, such as the US, Mexico, Chile, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and China) are among the most favourable for the large-scale installation of photovoltaic and concentrating solar power systems, which are currently the most important technologies used in solar energy production.

J	Anderson, K; Broderick, JF; Stoddard, I				Anderson, Kevin; Broderick, John F.; Stoddard, Isak			A factor of two: how the mitigation plans of 'climate progressive' nations fall far short of Paris-compliant pathways	CLIMATE POLICY			English	Article						Carbon budgets; Developed country mitigation; Paris Agreement; CBDR&RC; Negative Emissions Technologies (NETs); Energy sector emissions	CO2 EMISSIONS; METHANE; POLICY	The Paris Agreement establishes an international covenant to reduce emissions in line with holding the increase in temperature to 'well below 2 degrees C horizontal ellipsis and to pursue horizontal ellipsis 1.5 degrees C.' Global modelling studies have repeatedly concluded that such commitments can be delivered through technocratic adjustments to contemporary society, principally price mechanisms driving technical change. However, as emissions have continued to rise, so these models have come to increasingly rely on the extensive deployment of highly speculative negative emissions technologies (NETs). Moreover, in determining the mitigation challenges for industrialized nations, scant regard is paid to the language and spirit of equity enshrined in the Paris Agreement. If, instead, the mitigation agenda of 'developed country Parties' is determined without reliance on planetary scale NETs and with genuine regard for equity and 'common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities', the necessary rates of mitigation increase markedly. This is evident even when considering the UK and Sweden, two nations at the forefront of developing 'progressive' climate change legislation and with clear emissions pathways and/or quantitative carbon budgets. In both cases, the carbon budgets underpinning mitigation policy are halved, the immediate mitigation rate is increased to over 10% per annum, and the time to deliver a fully decarbonized energy system is brought forward to 2035-40. Such a challenging mitigation agenda implies profound changes to many facets of industrialized economies. This conclusion is not drawn from political ideology, but rather is a direct consequence of the international community's obligations under the Paris Agreement and the small and rapidly dwindling global carbon budget. Key Policy Insights Without a belief in the successful deployment of planetary scale negative emissions technologies, double-digit annual mitigation rates are required of developed countries, from 2020, if they are to align their policies with the Paris Agreement's temperature commitments and principles of equity. Paris-compliant carbon budgets for developed countries imply full decarbonization of energy by 2035-40, necessitating a scale of change in physical infrastructure reminiscent of the post-Second World War Marshall Plan. This brings issues of values, measures of prosperity and socio-economic inequality to the fore. The stringency of Paris-compliant pathways severely limits the opportunity for inter-sectoral emissions trading. Consequently aviation, as with all sectors, will need to identify policies to reduce emissions to zero, directly or through the use of zero carbon fuels. The UK and Swedish governments' emissions pathways imply a carbon budget of at least a factor of two greater than their fair contribution to delivering on the Paris Agreement's 1.5-2 degrees C commitment.

Purification steps are usually required in most H-2-production processes, providing the use of Pd-based membranes, particularly those supported on porous stainless steel (PSS), important advantages against other alternatives. In this work, new composite membranes were prepared by modifying PSS supports with graphite, as an intermediate layer, before incorporating a palladium film by electroless pore-plating. Fully dense Pd layers were reached, with an estimated thickness of around 17 mu m. Permeation measurements were carried out in two different modes: H-2 permeation from the inner to the outer side of the membrane (in-out) and in the opposite way (out-in). H-2 permeances between 3.24 x 10(-4) and 4.33 x 10(-4) mol m(-2) s(-1) Pa-0.5 with alpha(H2/N2) >= 10,000 were reached at 350-450 degrees C when permeating from the outer to the inner surface. Despite a general linear trend between permeating H-2 fluxes and pressures, the predicted intercept in (0,0) by the Sieverts' law was missed due to the partial Pd infiltration inside the pores. H-2-permeances progressively decreased up to around 33% for binary H-2-N-2 mixtures containing 40 vol% N-2 due to concentration-polarization phenomena. Finally, the good performance of these membranes was maintained after reversing the direction of the permeate flux. This fact practically demonstrates an adequate mechanical resistance despite generating tensile stress on the Pd layer during operation, which is not accomplished in other Pd membranes.

Among the signatory countries, those of Latin America have stood out for the high percentage of renewables in their energy mix and their commitment to continue advancing towards energy decarbonization. This commitment implies the need to adequately recognize the starting point of renewable energy consumption in the region, and its relationship with the population and regional production. This study analyzes the evolution of renewable energy consumption in the Latin American region and its member countries, in relation to the Worldwide position, from 1993 to 2018. For this, the direct consumption of renewable energies and the energy used to generate electricity and heat, have been considered. These values are analyzed in Worldwide per capita and per unit production terms. The results show that the Latin American region has a higher percentage of renewables in its energy mix than Worldwide, with this percentage being even higher when considering only the consumption of renewable energies of indirect origin. Brazil stands out for the share of its renewable consumption. In terms of per capita renewable energy consumption, Latin America presents higher values than those achieved Worldwide, with a growing trend throughout the studied period. The renewable energy intensity is also higher in Latin America, with a decreasing trend, as experienced Worldwide.

The pandemic shock leads to emissions' reductions consistent with the rates of decrease required to achieve the Paris Agreement goals. Those unforeseen drastic reductions in emissions are temporary as long as they do not involve structural changes. However, the COVID-19 consequences and the subsequent policy response will affect the economy for decades. Focusing on the EU, this discussion article argues how recovery plans are an opportunity to deepen the way towards a low-carbon economy, improving at the same time employment, health, and equity and the role of modelling tools. Long-term alignment with the low-carbon path and the development of a resilient transition towards renewable sources should guide instruments and policies, conditioning aid to energy-intensive sectors such as transport, tourism, and the automotive industry. However, the potential dangers of short-termism and carbon leakage persist. The current energy-socio-economic-environmental modelling tools are precious to widen the scope and deal with these complex problems. The scientific community has to assess disparate, non-equilibrium, and non-ordinary scenarios, such as sectors and countries lockdowns, drastic changes in con sumption patterns, significant investments in renewable energies, and disruptive technologies and incorporate uncertainty analysis. All these instruments will evaluate the cost-effectiveness of decarbonization options and potential consequences on employment, income distribution, and vulnerability. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

J	Stringer, T; Joanis, M				Stringer, Thomas; Joanis, Marcelin			Assessing energy transition costs: Sub-national challenges in Canada	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Energy transition; Sustainability; Fossil fuels; Renewable energy	100-PERCENT RENEWABLE ENERGY; ELECTRICITY; DECARBONISATION; INTEGRATION; PATHWAYS	Transitioning from non-renewable sources of energy to renewable ones is an important theme in any national government's energy policy nowadays. However, the investments required for such a transition are often said to be quite costly. In Canada, previous research has shown that a transition is economically feasible at the national level, but is an energy transition equally as feasible for each of Canada's provinces? This paper uses energy use simulation data and a costing model to assess the infrastructure expenditures for a carbon-neutral transition for each of the country's ten provinces from now until 2060. By calculating the costs for five different scenarios and taking into account the savings incurred by lower fossil fuel consumption post-transition, we find that most of Canada's provinces stands to gain from a pan-Canadian energy transition by each capturing fossil fuel savings. We also find that generally, provinces that produce electricity using fossil fuels are set to benefit from more savings following a transition than provinces that currently produce electricity using renewable sources.

The increase in levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of plants with CCS is primarily associated to the large energy penalty involved in CO2 capture. This study therefore evaluates three high-efficiency CCS concepts based on integrated gasification combined cycles (IGCC): (1) gas switching combustion (GSC), (2) GSC with added natural gas firing (GSC-AF) to increase the turbine inlet temperature, and (3) oxygen production pre-combustion (OPPC) that replaces the air separation unit (ASU) with more efficient gas switching oxygen production (GSOP) reactors. Relative to a supercritical pulverized coal benchmark, these options returned CO2 avoidance costs of 37.8, 22.4 and 37.5 euro/ton (including CO2 transport and storage), respectively. Thus, despite the higher fuel cost and emissions associated with added natural gas firing, the GSC-AF configuration emerged as the most promising solution. This advantage is maintained even at CO2 prices of 100 euro/ton, after which hydrogen firing can be used to avoid further CO2 cost escalations. The GSC-AF case also shows lower sensitivity to uncertain economic parameters such as discount rate and capacity factor, outperforms other clean energy benchmarks, offers flexibility benefits for balancing wind and solar power, and can achieve significant further performance gains from the use of more advanced gas turbine technology. Based on all these insights, the GSC-AF configuration is identified as a promising solution for further development.

A global sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the impact of key input parameters (i.e. algae composition, gasification temperature, feed water content, steam-to-biomass ratio, and fuel-air equivalence ratio) on the product yields. The algae oil content was varied from 0 to 40 wt% to account for different algae strains and varying extents of oil extraction prior to the gasification process. It was found that the lower heating value (LHV) of syngas, typically ranging from 15 to 22 MJ kg(algae)(-1), is heavily dependent on the algae oil content. The cold gas efficiency (CGE) of the process varies over a range of 75 to 90%, depending primarily on the feedstock water content and steam-to-biomass ratio. A cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment indicated that the carbon footprint of syngas produced from algae feedstocks with 20 to 40 wt% oil fraction that is dried by a gas-fired dryer lies within a range of 70 to 195 g CO2 MJ(-1). However, decarbonization of the drying stage via utilization of solar energy reduce the carbon footprint to values below 40 g CO2 MJ(-1), which would compare favorably with the carbon footprint of syngas produced via steam reforming of natural gas (i.e. similar to 100 g CO2 MJ(-1))	[Azadi, Pooya; Brownbridge, George; Mosbach, Sebastian; Kraft, Markus] Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem Engn & Biotechnol, Cambridge CB2 3RA, England; [Inderwildi, Oliver] World Econ Forum, CH-1223 Geneva, Cologny, Switzerland	University of Cambridge	Azadi, P (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem Engn & Biotechnol, New Museums Site,Pembroke St, Cambridge CB2 3RA, England.	mk306@cam.ac.uk	Kraft, Markus/D-7243-2016; Inderwildi, Oliver R/S-9621-2019	Kraft, Markus/0000-0002-4293-8924; Inderwildi, Oliver R/0000-0002-4315-7839; Mosbach, Sebastian/0000-0001-7018-9433	Technology Strategy Board (TSB) [TS/J004553]; Singapore National Research Foundation under its Campus for Research Excellence And Technological Enterprise (CREATE) program; EPSRC [EP/J501736/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/J501736/1] Funding Source: researchfish	Technology Strategy Board (TSB); Singapore National Research Foundation under its Campus for Research Excellence And Technological Enterprise (CREATE) program; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))	Part of this work was funded by the Technology Strategy Board (TSB) grant programme, "Carbon Abatement Technologies, Phase 2 competition for collaborative R&D and feasibility", grant no.

However, these goals are at odds with recent energy and emission trends in the country. Both energy use and GHG emissions in Mexico have grown substantially over the last two decades. We investigate how Mexico might reverse current trends and reach its mitigation targets by exploring results from energy system and economic models involved in the CLIMACAP-LAMP project. To meet Mexico's emission reduction targets, all modeling groups agree that decarbonization of electricity is needed, along with changes in the transport sector, either to more efficient vehicles or a combination of more efficient vehicles and lower carbon fuels. These measures reduce GHG emissions as well as emissions of other air pollutants. The models find different energy supply pathways, with some solutions based on renewable energy and others relying on biomass or fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage. The economy-wide costs of deep mitigation could range from 2% to 4% of GDP in 2030, and from 7% to 15% of GDP in 2050. Our results suggest that Mexico has some flexibility in designing deep mitigation strategies, and that technological options could allow Mexico to achieve its emission reduction targets, albeit at a cost to the country.

J	Calvillo, CF; Turner, K				Calvillo, Christian F.; Turner, Karen			Analysing the impacts of a large-scale EV rollout in the UK - How can we better inform environmental and climate policy?	ENERGY STRATEGY REVIEWS			English	Article						Energy cost; Energy policy; Energy system models; Electric vehicles; Network investments	ELECTRIC VEHICLES; DISTRIBUTION NETWORK; DECARBONISATION; COST	Electrifying transport to meet local pollution and overall net zero carbon ambitions is now a key UK policy focus, but this will have important impacts on the energy system, the economy, and the environment. Understanding the changes that the electrification of transport will bring is crucial for developing sustainable policies for net zero goals and a just transition. A literature is emerging to analyse the impact of a large-scale penetration of electric vehicles (EVs), but generally limiting focus to the implications for the electricity network. In this paper, we aim to provide insight on the wider energy system impacts of the expected EV rollout in the UK, in terms of fuel changes, energy costs, CO2 emission reduction and network investments; and how different EV charging strategies increase or mitigate the impacts of the expected large-scale penetration of EVs. Results show that non smart and/or decentralised charging will require considerably larger investments on the network to accommodate new EV demand. Network reinforcement costs are passed to the consumer via increased electricity prices and, albeit reduced, emissions shift from the transport to the power sector. These results show the importance of considering the whole energy system and the wider economy, to avoid carbon leakage and to maximise the effectiveness of policies.

How to Make Clean Hydrogen AWSM: The Advanced Water Splitting Materials Consortium	ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY INTERFACE			English	Article							HIGH-TEMPERATURE ELECTROLYSIS; OXIDE FUEL-CELLS; PROGRESS; POWER; CO2	Clean hydrogen is a carbon-free energy carrier that can be produced from water and sustainable energy sources such as wind, solar, and nuclear. Hence, clean hydrogen is one of the best ways to not only decarbonize the energy supply system, but also address the zero-emission challenges specific to large-carbon emitting industries that are difficult to separate from fossil fuels (e.g., heavy-duty trucking, load-following electricity, iron, steel, and cement). To help achieve the Biden Administration's goal of a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions by 2050, several tens of millions of metric tons of clean, low-cost hydrogen will be needed annually. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) recently launched the Hydrogen Energy EarthShot ("Hydrogen Shot") which aims to reduce the cost of clean hydrogen to $1 per 1 kilogram in 1 decade.(1) H2@Scale (Fig. 1) is a DOE initiative that supports the Hydrogen Shot goals to enable drastic decarbonization by scaling up low-cost clean hydrogen production, transport, storage, and utilization.(2) Clean hydrogen can power the grid, generate heat, be stored as an energy carrier, and be used to decarbonize multiple industrial sectors that are currently major contributors to carbon dioxide emissions. Some examples of these sectors are transportation, ammonia/fertilizer production, synthetic fuels, metal refining, and chemical/industrial processes. In summary, large-scale, low-cost hydrogen production from diverse domestic resources can enable an economically competitive and environmentally beneficial future energy system across multiple sectors.

J	Gibb, D; Johnson, M; Romani, J; Gasia, J; Cabeza, LF; Seitz, A				Gibb, Duncan; Johnson, Maike; Romani, Joaquim; Gasia, Jaume; Cabeza, Luisa F.; Seitz, Antje			Process integration of thermal energy storage systems - Evaluation methodology and case studies	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Thermal Energy Storage (TES); Technology assessment; Process integration; Process analysis; System boundary; Key Performance Indicators (KPI)	KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS; DIRECT STEAM-GENERATION; POWER-PLANTS; MANAGEMENT; EFFICIENCY; OPTIMIZATION; IMPACTS; DESIGN; KPIS; TOOL	As a key tool for decarbonization, thermal energy storage systems integrated into processes can address issues related to energy efficiency and process flexibility, improve utilization of renewable energy resources and thus reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, integration of these systems is dominated by the variety of potential processes in which the storage technologies can be deployed as well as the various benefits they deliver. Therefore, the requirements for thermal energy storage systems vary greatly depending on the chosen application, just as the systems themselves have different capabilities depending on their technical principles. This paper addresses this issue by developing a systematic methodology that approaches the challenge of characterizing and evaluating thermal energy storage systems in different applications in three concrete steps. To begin, a set of guidelines for process analysis has been created to disclose process requirements for storage integration. The methodology continues by explicitly defining the system boundary of a thermal energy storage system, as well as addressing technical and economic parameters. Finally, the approach concludes by determining the benefit of an integrated thermal energy storage system to an application and examines how key performance indicators vary based on the perspectives of different stakeholders. Within this work, the methodology is then applied to two case studies of high-temperature storage in concentrating solar power and co-generation plants. Also introduced are the concepts of retrofit and greenfield applications, which are used to clarify differences between integrated storage systems. The paper shows how such a systematic approach can be used to consistently analyse processes for storage integration, facilitate comparison between thermal energy storage systems integrated into processes across applications and finally grasp how different interests perceive the benefits of the integrated storage system. This type of systematic methodology for technology integration has not been previously developed and as such, is a novel and important contribution to the thermal energy storage community. In the long term, this work builds the basis for a discussion on benefits of thermal energy storage system integration with diverse stakeholders including storage system designers, process owners and policy makers.

J	Tarroja, B; Hittinger, E				Tarroja, Brian; Hittinger, Eric			The value of consumer acceptance of controlled electric vehicle charging in a decarbonizing grid: The case of California	ENERGY			English	Article						Electric vehicles; Smart charging; Greenhouse gas emissions; Consumer behavior	INTEGRATION; FUTURE; VARIABILITY; SYSTEM	Plug-in electric vehicles charged with zero-carbon electricity are important for decarbonizing regional energy systems. Flexible charging of these vehicles aids with grid integration of wind and solar generation but may require drivers to provide information about their travel patterns and allow grid operators to control the charging of their vehicles. Limited acceptance of flexible charging can potentially limit greenhouse gas emissions reductions from electric vehicle deployment. Therefore, here we assess how varying the extent of consumer acceptance of flexible charging affects electric vehicle greenhouse gas emissions reductions in a highly decarbonized California grid (>70% zero-carbon), a region with mandated zero-emission vehicle deployment and electricity decarbonization targets. We quantify the monetary value of flexible charging based on the reduction in stationary storage required to achieve a given zero-carbon penetration as flexible charging is adopted. We find that increased participation in smart charging and vehicle-to-grid increases zero-carbon generation uptake by up to 5.2% and 11.1%, respectively. The value of smart charging only reaches $87 per vehicle-year while that for vehicle-to-grid can reach $2,850 per vehicle-year. Non-monetary incentives may be needed to increase smart charging participation. These results can inform future analyses on the supply and demand for participation in flexible charging programs.

J	Roman-Collado, R; Economidou, M				Roman-Collado, Rocio; Economidou, Marina			The role of energy efficiency in assessing the progress towards the EU energy efficiency targets of 2020: Evidence from the European productive sectors	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Energy efficiency; Decomposition analysis; Productive sectors; EU2020 targets; Energy efficiency policy	DECOMPOSITION ANALYSIS; INTENSITY INDICATORS; CONSUMPTION; INDUSTRY; POLICIES	Energy efficiency is considered to be one of the most reliable ways of addressing some of the most pressing global challenges, such as energy independence and the fight against the negative effects of climate change. It is widely recognised that the EU path towards decarbonisation has to be accompanied by energy efficiency improvements. Focusing on the EU28 from the year 2000 onwards, this analysis aims at identifying the main driving factors behind the energy consumption changes at the global and sectoral level. Concretely, our focus on the productive sectors (responsible for 41% of total consumption) is due to the importance that these sectors have in reaching the overall EU targets. The novelty of this paper is that index decomposition analysis (concretely, LMDI-I) is applied considering: i) the alternative effects to the traditional ones; ii) different degrees of disaggregation and iii) new methodological approaches according to the most recent research literature on this topic. The results suggest that there have been important energy efficiency gains during the period studied. Without these gains the progress achieved towards the EU energy efficiency targets would have been difficult to attain. Despite this, the physical-based analysis shows that the energy efficiency gains are of a lower magnitude compared to the monetary-based analysis. The results provide some energy policy recommendations related to the effectiveness of past energy efficiency measures and shed light on key sectors for which there is still room for improvement.

Of the various types of ocean energy (wave, tidal, offshore wind, salinity gradient and thermal gradient), this paper is focused on technologies with which to harness the energy from ocean currents. This energy will have considerable possibilities in the future thanks to its high predictability and its enormous potential for the production of electricity. Most of the review papers concerning tidal energy systems are focused on engineering topics. However, there continues to be limited information as regards other aspects, such as those of an economical, social, political, legislative and environmental nature which, together with their interrelationships, need to be dealt with as a whole in order to detect the key drivers that could affect the success or failure of making tidal energy technologies marketable. The objective of this review paper is to address this gap by providing a detailed strategic analysis based on the most up-to-date literature, reports and guidelines. The paper discusses the different disciplines of which the PESTEL analysis (political, economical, social, technological, environmental and legal) is composed and provides different strategies/recommendations through which to mitigate many of the risks identified in order to facilitate the successful development of these technologies and bring them onto the market. Finally, some recent advances in tidal technologies developed by our research group (GIT-ERM) are also highlighted in the technological part of this paper.

Accordingly, the aim of this study was to evaluate the techno-economic potential of bioenergy (electric and thermal energy) production from the anaerobic digestion (AD) of vinasse and stillage. Three scenarios were defined: (a) Scenario 1, AD of vinasse; (b) Scenario 2, AD of stillage; and (c) Scenario 3, AD of vinasse and stillage in an integrated process. From the results, the methane production was estimated at 3.8 x 106 m3 year-1 considering the AD of stillage and vinasse in Scenario 3. The electricity and thermal energy generation was estimated as 14.61 GWh year-1 and 1.37 x 105 GJ year-1, respectively. This energy would mitigate 1096.05 and 7659.27 ton CO2eq year-1 when replacing fossil fuel energy. The profitability analysis indicated a positive net present value in the scenarios evaluated, however, the highest value was achieved for Scenario 3 (7,890,407.44 USD). For the integrated process, an internal return rate of 86.87% and a payback of 0.68 year were observed. The sensitivity analysis showed that the project profitability is highly dependent on electricity and thermal energy selling prices. In conclusion, AD demonstrated to be a feasible alternative for vinasse and stillage management in an integrated process, being a sustainable technology to the circular economy transition and energy matrix decarbonization.

J	Cox, J; Belding, S; Lowder, T				Cox, Jordan; Belding, Scott; Lowder, Travis			Application of a novel heat pump model for estimating economic viability and barriers of heat pumps in dairy applications in the United States	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Heat pumps; High temperature heat pumps; Industrial energy; Waste heat recovery	THERMODYNAMIC ANALYSIS; ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; EXERGY ANALYSIS; TEMPERATURE; PERFORMANCE; SIMULATION; REFRIGERANTS; INTEGRATION; EMISSIONS; MILK	Heat pumps represent an important opportunity for energy savings and decarbonization. This work investigates the techno-economic performance of high-temperature heat pumps (HTHPs) for use in the U.S. dairy industry. The studied heat pump performs a 50 degrees C temperature lift on a waste heat stream of cleaning water and applies the upgraded heat stream to a fluid milk pasteurization process. This work involved the creation of a HTHP model that estimated the coefficient of performance (COP), internal rate of return (IRR), net present value (NPV), and payback period (PBP), and emissions saved for a heat pump replacing a natural gas boiler. Capital costs, operations, and maintenance (O&M) cost, heat pump lifetime, electricity prices, natural gas prices, and a cost of carbon were varied to perform a parametric study on the factors affecting the break-even price of HTHPs. The results show that HTHP economics are highly sensitive to COP and energy price environment, and less sensitive to capital and O&M cost variance, leading to a large scatter of positive and negative NPVs based on U.S. location. PBPs demonstrate a defined threshold, based on energy price environment, below which favorable two-to-threeyear PBPs predominate. This work is focused on the U.S. dairy industry, but international application in relation to fossil vs. electricity price regimes. Heat pumps have seen wider adoption in regions with a high ratio of fossil energy to electricity prices ($/MMBTU vs. $/kWh). The U.S. has plentiful natural gas resulting in lower fossil energy prices which has reduced heat pump adoption. This paper identifies potential first mover industries for HTHP adoption and their associated price regimes even in regions with lower ratios of fossil energy to electricity prices that exist many places globally.

J	Preziuso, D; Orrell, A; Lantz, E				Preziuso, Danielle; Orrell, Alice; Lantz, Eric			Categorizing distributed wind energy installations in the United States to inform research and stakeholder priorities	ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Distributed wind; Wind energy; Market categorization		Background Distributed wind energy adoption in the United States can contribute to the diverse portfolio of energy technologies needed to achieve ambitious decarbonization goals. However, with limited deployment to date, the current distributed wind market must be better understood; these efforts will support the range of stakeholders who will drive successful deployment. This article first distinguishes three categories of distributed wind from existing literature: (1) behind the meter, (2) intended for explicit local load, and (3) physically distributed. A novel methodology to classify individual wind installations into each of these categories is then presented and applied to two data sets of wind installations in the United States to categorize and illuminate distinct segments in the distributed wind market. Results Physically distributed installations, constituted by small to moderately sized projects serving local loads on distribution systems solely because of their proximity to them, account for the highest amount of capacity but the lowest number of installations out of the three categories. The inverse is true for behind-the-meter installations, which are used to serve on-site loads. Installations intended for explicit local load, which are interconnected on the utility side of the distribution system and intentionally built to provide energy to loads on the same distribution system, rank in the middle for both installed capacity and number of installations. Conclusions Distributed wind energy deployment in the United States is geographically widespread, but the extent to which a single category is developed in each state varies. Policies, wind resources, and broad energy technology trends contribute to these deployment patterns. By identifying the extent to which each category of installations exists, decision-makers are empowered with data necessary to tailor research and development programs and address stakeholder priorities through policy and other means, ultimately supporting future deployment.

A map of roadmaps for zero and low energy and carbon buildings worldwide	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Review						zero energy building; low energy building; zero carbon building; roadmap; evidence map; literature review; ZLECB	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS; DEMAND-SIDE SOLUTIONS; 1.5 DEGREES-C; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NET-ZERO; EMBODIED ENERGY; LIFE-CYCLE; CHINA; SECTOR; CONSTRUCTION	Formulation of targets and establishing which factors in different contexts will achieve these targets are critical to successful decarbonization of the building sector. To contribute to this, we have performed an evidence map of roadmaps for zero and low energy and carbon buildings (ZLECB) worldwide, including a list and classification of documents in an on-line geographical map, a description of gaps, and a narrative review of the knowledge gluts. We have retrieved 1219 scientific documents from Scopus, extracted metadata from 274 documents, and identified 117 roadmaps, policies or plans from 27 countries worldwide. We find that there is a coverage bias towards more developed regions. The identified scientific studies are mostly recommendations to policy makers, different types of case studies, and demonstration projects. The geographical inequalities found in the coverage of the scientific literature are even more extreme in the coverage of the roadmaps. These underexplored world regions represent an area for further investigation and increased research/policy attention. Our review of the more substantial amount of literature and roadmaps for developed regions shows differences in target metrics and enforcement mechanisms but that all regions dedicate some efforts at national and local levels. Roadmaps generally focus more on new and public buildings than existing buildings, despite the fact that the latter are naturally larger in number and total floor area, and perform less energy efficiently. A combination of efficiency, technical upgrades, and renewable generation is generally proposed in the roadmaps, with behavioral measures only reflected in the use of information and communication technologies, and minimal focus being placed on lifecycle perspectives. We conclude that insufficient progress is being made in the implementation of ZLECB. More work is needed to couple the existing climate goals, with realistic, enforceable policies to make the carbon savings a reality for different contexts and stakeholders worldwide.

Domestic heat pumps are viewed as a potentially important carbon saving technology, given the ongoing decarbonisation of the electricity supply system. To address the lack of independent evaluation of heat pump performance, the Energy Saving Trust undertook the UK's first large-scale heat pump field trial, which monitored 83 systems in real installations. As part of the trial, the Open University studied the consumers' experience of using a domestic heat pump. An in-depth user survey investigated the characteristics, behaviour, and satisfactions of private householders and social housing residents using ground source and air source heat pumps for space and/or water heating, and examined the influence of user-related factors on measured heat pump system efficiency. The surveys found that most users were satisfied with the reliability, heating, hot water, warmth and comfort provided by their system. Analysis of user characteristics showed that higher system efficiencies were associated with greater user understanding of their heat pump system, and more continuous heat pump operation, although larger samples are needed for robust statistical confirmation. The analysis also found that the more efficient systems in the sample were more frequently located in the private dwellings than at the social housing sites and this difference was significant. This is explained by the interaction between differences in the systems, dwellings and users at the private and social housing sites. The implications for heat pump research, practice and policy are discussed.

J	Teng, F; Jotzo, F; Wang, X				Teng, Fei; Jotzo, Frank; Wang, Xin			Interactions between market reform and a carbon price in China's power sector	ECONOMICS OF ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY			English	Article						Climate change; emission trading scheme; electricity reform; policy interaction	TRADING SCHEME; DESIGN	The electricity sector accounts for a large share of China's carbon dioxide emissions and of the economy-wide abatement potential. China's planned national emissions trading scheme would include electricity generation, as nearly all emissions trading schemes do. The critical difference is that in most existing carbon pricing systems the power sector operates with competitive markets and cost-based pricing, while the Chinese power industry still uses a highly regulated dispatch and pricing system. Together these limitations mean that the effect of a carbon price on China is limited in terms of the impact on operational decisions for existing power stations and in terms of the effects on investment decisions. We explore the channels of interaction between electricity market reform and carbon pricing in China, and provide quantitative estimates of the effects and interactions on electricity sector emissions. A probabilistic discrete choice model is used to simulate the behavior of investors in the power sector. The analysis indicates that market reform can help reduce emissions intensity, but to meet China's 2030 targets for non fossil fuel generation a low to moderate carbon price is also necessary; conversely, a carbon price will only be effective with market reform that provides flexibility in dispatch. Using our simplified quantitative analysis, the carbon price required for the same share of non-fossil fuel generation would be about twice as high without market reform. Combining market reform and a carbon price could achieve significant rates of decarbonization and is likely to be the most effective and most feasibly policy package to cut emissions from China's power sector.

Diesel-boiling-range bioblendstocks have gained traction, owing to their superior fuel properties and environmental performance as compared to traditional petroleum fuels. This work couples refinery linear programming models with life cycle assessment to quantify the potential economic and environmental benefits, and trade-offs, of blending diesel-boiling-range bioblendstocks at petroleum refineries. Linear programming models were developed in Aspen Process Industry Modeling Systems (PIMS) for three representative petroleum refinery configurations of differing complexity. Seven diesel-boiling-range bioblendstocks: 4-butoxyheptane, 5-ethyl-4-propylnonane, soy biodiesel, sludge hydrothermal liquefaction diesel, polyoxymethylene ethers, renewable diesel, and hexyl hexanoate, were investigated to identify key fuel properties that influence refineries' economics and to track the effect of adding bioblendstocks on refinery-wide cradle-to-gate greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. These analyses considered blending levels from 10 to 30 vol % and fuel demand projections over the period 2040 to 2050. This analysis determines that bioblendstock sulfur content and cetane number are the primary fuel attributes with the potential to provide value to refiners. Life cycle assessment results indicate that the use of diesel-boiling-range bioblendstocks can reduce cradle-to-gate refinery GHG emissions by up to similar to 40 % relative to conventional refinery operations when considering carbon uptake in the supply chain of the bioblendstock. Refinery-wide marginal GHG abatement costs range from 120 to 3,600 USD2016/metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent avoided across the scenarios evaluated. Reducing the price of bioblendstocks is identified as a key to their adoption.

In this regard, the use of the renewable chitosan (CS) biopolymer as ion-exchange binder of the copper (Cu) electrocatalyst nanoparticles (NPs) is compared with commercial anion-exchange binders Sustainion and Fumion on the fabrication of gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2R) in an alkaline medium. They were tested in membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs), where selectivity to ethylene (C2H4) increased when using the Cu:CS GDE compared to the Cu:Sustainion and Cu:Fumion GDEs, respectively, with a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 93.7% at 10 mA cm(-2) and a cell potential of -1.9 V, with a C2H4 production rate of 420 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for the Cu:CS GDE. Upon increasing current density to 90 mA cm(-2), however, the production rate of the Cu:CS GDE rose to 509 mu mol/m(2)s but the FE dropped to 69% due to increasing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) competition. The control of mass transport limitations by tuning up the membrane overlayer properties in membrane coated electrodes (MCE) prepared by coating a CS-based membrane over the Cu:CS GDE enhanced its selectivity to C2H4 to a FE of 98% at 10 mA cm(-2) with negligible competing HER. The concentration of carbon monoxide was below the experimental detection limit irrespective of the current density, with no CO2 crossover to the anodic compartment. This study suggests there may be potential in sustainable alernatives to fossil-based or perfluorinated materials in ion-exchange membrane and electrode fabrication, which constitute a step forward towards decarbonization in the circular economy perspective.

We consider a model for the long-term evolution of the power grid including propagation of cascading failures, day-to-day fluctuations of renewable generation and moderate use of storage. We analyze grid resilience and stress as VRESs are progressively incorporated. We also evaluate the VRES performance as the average fraction of daily demand covered by renewables. We find that in general, VRES intrinsic variability increases the grid stress and the blackout risk. However, if VRESs are implemented in a distributed way, the spatial spreading of the generation may have a positive effect on grid resilience. As a case study, we analyze the replacement of conventional power plants by solar photovoltaic generation combined with storage in the power grid of the Balearic Islands. We also consider the use of source redundancy and briefly discuss the potential of wind energy.

Descriptive and inferential statistics as an exhaust emission comparative tool between different engine operating conditions and fuels. Application to highly oxidized biodiesel blended with primary alcohols	FUEL			English	Article						HSD Tukey test; Methyl esters; Engine test bench; Low quality biodiesel	DIESEL-ENGINE; ETHANOL; PERFORMANCE; VISCOSITY; BUTANOL; OIL	Despite the great electrification that vehicle fleet is expecting in the coming years, internal combustion engines still play an important role in the transport sector. New regulations for polluting emission reduction and economy decarbonization, together with lower availability of fuels from non-renewable sources, have led to the search of renewable non-polluting fuels. This is a fundamental research sector in the next decades. Biodiesel, with a long history, has proven to be a good candidate. However, diversification will be the key to success in terms of sustainable mobility, avoiding negative dependency in the future. In this context, discarded oil is key to both produce an economically affordable biodiesel and to valorize this residue. This research studies the possibility of using a binary mix of fuels, including primary alcohols (propanol and pentanol), at 10 and 20% v/v, with highly-oxidized dumped oil biodiesel. These mixtures have been tested in a diesel engine running at 1300, 1700 and 2400 rpm, under 25% and 46% engine load for each rotational speed. To check the significance and reproducibility of obtained data, polluting emissions and engine input parameters have been evaluated through descriptive and inferential statistics. Results indicate that 20% 1-propanol/biodiesel blend allows mitigating the increase in fuel consumption of biodiesel compared to fossil diesel fuel. Moreover, overall soluble organic fraction (SOF) and unburned hydrocarbon emissions are lower for biodiesel and its blends than for diesel fuel. Furthermore, the combination of the use of 10% propanol and maximum EGR valve opening can achieve a significant reduction of NOx emissions. As a final conclusion, the proposed statistical study has shown to be a reliable tool to compare emissions and input parameters from different tests, especially under intra-urban conditions. This overcomes the large data variability from emission tests.	[Leiva-Candia, D. E.; Garcia, I. L.; Serrano-Herrador, J. A.; Dorado, M.

In this context, this study was built to quantify the environmental performance of a two-stage wastewater treatment process (dark fermentation with anaerobic digestion) in which three feedstocks (sugar beet molasses, cheese whey and wine vinasses mixed with wastewater treatment plant sludge) from the food industry were valorized as hydrogen. In this regard, several environmental profiles were created using the Life Cycle Assessment methodology with two system boundaries (cradle-to-gate and gate-togate) and two methods (ReCiPe Midpoint and Endpoint). Furthermore, this research was synergistically complemented with an energy analysis including indicators and input-output flow balances to provide a win-win solution for food waste utilization. The results have taken different directions depending on the methodological assumptions considered but, in general terms, the sugar beet molasses scenario can be claimed in all cases as the energetically sustainable process with the best environmental profile. With an energy surplus of 155%, the cradle-to-gate scenario recorded the best environmental impact in 4/8 midpoint categories and an overall reduction of 67% and 94% (excluding co-products) for the ReCiPe damage single score compared to the wine vinasses and wastewater treatment plant sludge and cheese whey scenarios, respectively. In this sense, the viability and competitiveness of these two scenarios is compromised by the lack of energy self-sufficiency (there is a 53% deficiency in the wine vinasses and wastewater treatment sludge scenario) and the lack of climateneutral outcomes (a result of 5510 mPt/Nm3 H2 shows that the cheese whey scenario is far from being a zero-emission process).

R.			Hydrogen production from landfill biogas: Profitability analysis of a real case study	FUEL			English	Article						Hydrogen production; Biogas reforming; Green energy production; Waste valorization; Profitability analysis		Hydrogen is not only considered as a cornerstone within renewable energy portfolio but it is also a key enabler for CO2 valorisation being a central resource for industrial decarbonization. This work evaluates the profitability of hydrogen production via combined biogas reforming and water-gas shift reaction, based on a real case scenario for landfill biogas plant in Seville (Spain). A techno-economic model was developed based on a process model and the discounted cash-flow method. A biogas flow of 700 m(3)/h (input given by the landfill biogas plant) was used as plant size and the analysis was carried out for two different cases: (1) use of already available energy sources at the industrial plant, and (2) solar energy generation to power the process. The economic outputs obtained showed that under the current circumstances, this hydrogen production route is not profitable. The main reason is the relatively low current hydrogen prices which comes from fossil fuels. A revenues analysis indicates that hydrogen from biogas selling prices between 2.9 and 5.7 euro/kg would be needed to reach profitability, which are considerably higher than the current hydrogen cost (1.7 euro/kg). A subsidy scheme is suggested to improve the competitiveness of this hydrogen production process in the short-medium term. A cost analysis is also performed, revealing that electricity prices and investment costs have a high impact on the total share (23-40% and 8-22%, respectively). Other potential costs reduction such as catalyst, labour and manteinance & overhead are also evaluated, showing that cutting-down production costs is mandatory to unlock the potential of hydrogen generation from biogas. Our work showcases the techno-economic challenge that green energy policies face in the path toward sustainable societies.

These are often formulated as relative shares of electricity demand or supply. Implementing respective constraints in energy models is a surprisingly delicate issue. They may cause a modeling artifact of excessive electricity storage use. We introduce this phenomenon as "unintended storage cycling'', which can be detected in case of simultaneous storage charging and discharging. In this paper, we provide an analytical representation of different approaches for implementing minimum renewable share constraints in energy models, and show how these may lead to unintended storage cycling. Using a parsimonious optimization model, we quantify related distortions of optimal dispatch and investment decisions as well as market prices, and identify important drivers of the phenomenon. Finally, we provide recommendations on how to avoid the distorting effects of unintended storage cycling in energy modeling.

J	Brown, MA; Tudawe, R; Steimer, H				Brown, Marilyn A.; Tudawe, Ranal; Steimer, Hamilton			Carbon drawdown potential of utility-scale solar in the United States: Evidence from the state of Georgia	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS			English	Article						Solar photovoltaics; Air pollution; Solar farms; GHG emissions; Public health	DEEP-DECARBONIZATION; AIR-POLLUTION; ENERGY; MORTALITY; IMPACTS	Governments around the world recognize the need to identify options for reducing their carbon footprints, tailored to local conditions. In an analysis of the U.S. state of Georgia, both utility-scale and rooftop solar were down-selected among 20 from a set of 100 options, prompting analysis of the pros and cons of different types of solar systems. Analysis included simulating a modest carbon tax (starting at $10/tonne CO2) in a computable general equilibrium model of the U.S. energy system. On the one hand, the results indicate that utility-scale solar could reduce Georgia's carbon footprint by an additional 10% by 2030. Currently, 98% of Georgia's solar electricity comes from utility-scale solar and only 2% from rooftop solar. Each additional tonne of CO2 avoided in 2030 would have private costs of -$3.9 to +$71 and would produce significant social benefits of $68 to $79. On the other hand, the modeling suggests that a $10 carbon tax is not sufficient to spur the growth of rooftop solar in Georgia. Additional incentives would be needed, but their traditional design could hurt low-income customers. As a class, low-income households subsidize affluent homeowners who own rooftop solar by paying higher electricity prices that allow utilities to offer solar incentives. These trade-offs are prompting proposals to grow utility-scale solar at the expense of rooftop solar. However, choosing one or the other type of solar represents a false dichotomy. Ultimately, meeting science-based climate goals will require a broad, deep, and rapid response that engages both utility-scale and rooftop solar.

Electrification of LDVs is posed as a potential solution, but SI engines can still contribute to decarbonization. Car manufacturers have turned to unconventional engine operation to increase the efficiency of Spark-Ignition (SI) engines and reduce the carbon emissions of their fleets. Dilute, lean, and stratified-charge engine operation has the potential for engine efficiency improvements at the expense of increased cyclic variability and combustion instability. At such demanding engine conditions, the spark ignition event is key for flame initiation and propagation and for enhanced combustion stability. Reliable and accurate spark ignition models can help design ignition systems that reduce cyclic variability. Multiple computational spark-ignition models exist that perform well under conventional conditions, but the underlying physics needs to be expanded, for unconventional engine operation. In this paper, a hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian Spark-Ignition (LESI) model is coupled with different turbulent flame propagation models for engine simulations. LESI relies on Lagrangian arc tracking and Eulerian energy deposition. The LESI model is coupled with the Well-Stirred Reactor (WSR), Thickened Flame Model (TFM), and g-equation model and used to simulate several cycles of a Direct-Injection Spark-Ignition (DISI) engine using a commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) engine solver. The results showcase the successful coupling of LESI with the combustion models. Global engine metrics, such as pressure and Apparent Heat Release Rate (AHRR), for each simulation setup are compared to experimental engine results, for validation. In addition, results highlight the successful prediction of spark channel movement by comparing simulation images to experimental optical engine images. Finally, the successful coupling of LESI to combustion models, making it a usable model in the engine modeling community, is emphasized and future development details are discussed.

Since the first demonstration of 29% efficient TPVs (Fig. 1a) using an integrated back surface reflector and a tungsten emitter at 2,000 degrees C (ref.(10)), TPV fabrication and performance have improved(11,12). However, despite predictions that TPV efficiencies can exceed 50% (refs.(11,13,14)), the demonstrated efficiencies are still only as high as 32%, albeit at much lower temperatures below 1,300 degrees C (refs.(13-15)). Here we report the fabrication and measurement of TPV cells with efficiencies of more than 40% and experimentally demonstrate the efficiency of high-bandgap tandem TPV cells. The TPV cells are two-junction devices comprising III-V materials with bandgaps between 1.0 and 1.4 eV that are optimized for emitter temperatures of 1,900-2,400 degrees C. The cells exploit the concept of band-edge spectral filtering to obtain high efficiency, using highly reflective back surface reflectors to reject unusable sub-bandgap radiation back to the emitter. A 1.4/1.2 eV device reached a maximum efficiency of (41.1 +/- 1)% operating at a power density of 2.39 W cm(-2) and an emitter temperature of 2,400 degrees C. A 1.2/1.0 eV device reached a maximum efficiency of (39.3 +/- 1)% operating at a power density of 1.8 W cm(-2) and an emitter temperature of 2,127 degrees C. These cells can be integrated into a TPV system for thermal energy grid storage to enable dispatchable renewable energy. This creates a pathway for thermal energy grid storage to reach sufficiently high efficiency and sufficiently low cost to enable decarbonization of the electricity grid.

J	Cha, JMJ				Cha, J. Mijin			A just transition for whom? Politics, contestation, and social identity in the disruption of coal in the Powder River Basin	ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Just transition; Energy transition; Energy justice; Climate change; Contested transition; Coal mining; Powder River Basin, Wyoming	ENERGY JUSTICE; UNITED-STATES; INSIGHTS; ECONOMY; POWER; DECARBONIZATION; DYNAMICS	Substantially decreasing carbon emissions is both necessary to stave off the worst impacts of climate change and also certain to result in a loss of jobs and revenue for fossil fuel communities and workers. Just transition policies aim to mitigate these losses and provide an equitable transition away from fossil fuel extraction and use. Yet, just transition is often contested in the regions the policies are meant to aid. This paper presents a case study of the Powder River Basin, Wyoming, the largest coal mining region in the U.S where the energy transition is deeply contested. In the summer of 2019, two large coal mines suddenly and unexpectedly shut down. The research conducted explored whether this sudden change in conditions changed perceptions toward the energy transition or just transition polices based on interviews with decision makers, environmental advocates, coal industry officials, and union officials. I find that the energy transition and just transition remains deeply contested and opposed, even after the sudden closure of the mines, indicating that transition may always be contested due to the long-standing role coal has played in the region. Despite opposition and efforts to prolong the life of the coal industry, an energy transition is occurring and a government-led managed decline with just transition policies is the best way to prevent severe economic distress in the region.

J	Huang, B; Xing, K; Pullen, S; Liao, LD				Huang, Bin; Xing, Ke; Pullen, Stephen; Liao, Lida			Exploring Carbon Neutral Potential in Urban Densification: A Precinct Perspective and Scenario Analysis	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						carbon neutral; precinct dynamics; carbon offset; renewable energy penetration; city evolution	LIFE-CYCLE; ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EMISSIONS; CHINA; CITY; PATHWAYS; IMPACT	Decarbonising the urban built environment for reaching carbon neutrality is high on the agenda for many cities undergoing rapid expansion and densification. As an important urban form, precincts have been increasingly focused on as the context for urban redevelopment planning and at the forefront for trialling carbon reduction measures. However, due to interplays between the built forms and the occupancy, the carbon performance of a precinct is significantly affected by morphological variations, demographical changes, and renewable energy system deployment. Despite much research on the development of low-carbon precincts, there is limited analysis on aggregated effects of population growth, building energy efficiency, renewable energy penetration, and carbon reduction targets in relation to precinct carbon signature and carbon neutral potential for precinct redevelopment and decarbonisation planning. In this paper, an integrated carbon assessment model, including overall precinct carbon emissions and carbon offset contributed by precinct-scale renewable energy harvesting, is developed and applied to examine the lifecycle carbon signature of urban precincts. Using a case study on a residential precinct redevelopment, scenario analysis is employed to explore opportunities for decarbonising densification development and the carbon neutral potential. Results from scenario analysis indicate that redevelopment of buildings with higher-rated energy efficiency and increase of renewable energy penetration can have a long term positive impact on the carbon performance of urban precincts. Meanwhile, demographical factors in precinct evolution also have a strong influence on a precinct's carbon neutral potential. Whilst population size exerts upward pressure on total carbon emissions, changes in family types and associated consumption behaviour, such as travelling, can make positive contributions to carbon reduction. The analysis also highlights the significance of embodied carbon to the total carbon signature and the carbon reduction potential of a precinct during densification, reinforcing the notion that "develop with less" is as important as carbon offsetting measures for decarbonising the precinct toward carbon neutrality.

J	Harrison-Atlas, D; Lopez, A; Lantz, E				Harrison-Atlas, Dylan; Lopez, Anthony; Lantz, Eric			Dynamic land use implications of rapidly expanding and evolving wind power deployment	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						wind power; renewable energy; land use; spatial analysis; environmental impacts; sustainability	ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS; ENERGY DEVELOPMENT; GENERATION; REQUIREMENTS; ACCEPTANCE; NIMBYISM; ONSHORE; BATS	The expansion of wind power poses distinct and varied geographic challenges to a sustainable energy transition. However, current knowledge of its land use impacts and synergies is limited by reliance on static characterizations that overlook the role of turbine technology and plant design in mediating interactions with the environment. Here, we investigate how wind technology development and innovation have shaped landscape interactions with social and ecological systems within the United States and contribute to evolving land area requirements. This work assesses trends in key land use facets of wind power using a holistic set of metrics to establish an evidence base that researchers, technology designers, land use managers, and policymakers can use in envisioning how future wind-intensive energy systems may be jointly optimized for clean energy, social, and environmental objectives. Since 2000, we find dynamic land occupancy patterns and regional trends that are driven by advancing technology and geographic factors. Though most historical U.S. wind deployment has been confined to the temperate grassland biome in the nation's interior, regional expansion has implicated diverse land use and cover types. A large percentage of the typical wind plant footprint (similar to 96% to > 99%) is not directly impacted by permanent physical infrastructure, allowing for multiple uses in the spaces between turbines. Surprisingly, turbines are commonly close to built structures. Moreover, rangeland and cropland have supported 93.4% of deployment, highlighting potential synergies with agricultural lands. Despite broadly decreasing capacity densities, offsetting technology improvements have stabilized power densities. Land use intensity, defined as the ratio of direct land usage to lifetime power generation of wind facilities, has also trended downwards. Although continued deployment on disturbed lands, and in close proximity to existing wind facilities and other infrastructure, could minimize the extent of impacts, ambitious decarbonization trajectories may predispose particular biomes to cumulative effects and risks from regional wind power saturation. Increased land-use and sustainability feedback in technology and plant design will be critical to sustainable management of wind power.

Much analytic work has been dedicated to evaluating the cost and performance of various CO2 capture technologies, but less attention has been paid to evaluating the cost of CO2 transport and storage. Many integrated assessment modeling studies assume a combined cost for CO2 transport and storage that is uniform in all regions, commonly estimated at $10/tCO2. Realistically, the cost of CO2 transport and storage is not fixed at $10/tCO2 and varies across geographic, geologic, and institutional settings. We surveyed the literature to identify key sources of variability in transport and storage costs and developed a method to quantify and incorporate these elements into a cost range. We find that onshore pipeline transport and storage costs vary from $4 to 45/tCO2 depending on key sources of variability including transport distance, scale (i.e. quantity of CO2 transported and stored), monitoring assumptions, reservoir geology, and transport cost variability such as pipeline capital costs. Using the MIT Economic Projection and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model, we examined the impact of variability in transport and storage costs by applying a range of uniform costs in all regions in a future where global temperature rise is limited to 2 degrees C. We then developed three modeling cases where transport and storage costs vary regionally. In these latter cases, global cumulative CO2 captured and stored through 2100 ranges from 290 to 377 Gt CO2, compared to 425 Gt CO2 when costs are assumed to be uniformly $10/t CO2 in all regions. We conclude that the widely used assumption of $10/tCO2 for the transport and storage of CO2 is reasonable in some regions, but not in others. Moreover, CCS deployment is more sensitive to transport and storage costs in some regions than others, particularly China. More analysis is needed to further quantify CO2 transport and storage costs at a regional level.

J	Dean, M; Blackford, J; Connelly, D; Hines, R				Dean, Marcella; Blackford, Jerry; Connelly, Douglas; Hines, Rob			Insights and guidance for offshore CO2 storage monitoring based on the QICS, ETI MMV, and STEMM-CCS projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL			English	Article						Monitoring; Verification; CCS; Offshore CO2 storage; Detection; Location; Attribution; Quantification; Impact assessment; Regulation	CONTROLLED SUBSEABED RELEASE; SEA-FLOOR; MARINE-SEDIMENTS; FIELD EXPERIMENT; BUBBLE PLUMES; LEAKED CO2; DYNAMICS; LEAKAGE; WATER; COMMUNITY	Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a collective term for technologies that allow society to unlock the benefits of energy intensive processes like fertiliser production and combustion of fuels (fossil or biologically sourced) without releasing the CO2 to the atmosphere. Hence, CCS could assist in accelerating decarbonisation while society pursues a just energy transition. This paper aims to summarise the "earnings of three research projects that all investigated aspects of marine monitoring for CCS from a CO2 storage operator's perspective. The QICS (Quantifying and Monitoring Potential Ecosystem Impacts of Geological Carbon Storage), ETI MMV (Energy Technologies Institute Measurement, Monitoring and Verification of CO2 Storage), and STEMM-CCS (Strategies for Environmental Monitoring of Marine CCS) projects collectively represent over twelve years of dedicated research to assess environmental impacts and to develop technologies for detection, location, and quantification of potential leakage from offshore geological storage of CO2. Each project used controlled releases in representative environments to test their methods and technologies. QICS as the first of the three projects, focused on the understanding of sensitivities of the UK marine environment to a potential leak from a CO2 storage complex and tested technologies to detect such emissions. The ETI MMV project brought together research and industry partners to develop and sea trial an operational, integrated and cost-effective marine monitoring system for geological CO2 storage. As a commercial project, these results have never been published before and this paper shares for the first-time insights from this work. In February 2020, STEMM-CCS, completed its quest to test techniques for environmental monitoring over a marine CO2 storage site in the UK North Sea, further improved near seabed leakage characterisation capabilities, and delivered a first marine CCS demonstration level ecological baseline. This paper aims to summarise some of the key insights from the three projects and provides references where available for the interested reader. The key finding of all three projects is that the impacts of small to medium CO2 leakages from large-scale storage are limited and localised. Technology capabilities exist for integrated marine CO2 storage monitoring and their performance has been benchmarked at controlled release trials. Even small leakages of 10-50 L/min can be detected at unknown locations in a large area of interest. Finally, the first important steps towards automated monitoring data analysis have been made, including automated leakage signal detection from Side Scan Sonar data (ETI MMV project) and automated species identification from marine biology images (STEMM-CCS project). Some remaining challenges include missed/false alerts because of large variations in the background signal, the cost of monitoring large areas over long periods, and making real-time decisions based on big data. Continued work to reduce the cost of marine monitoring technologies and advancing automation of data processing and analysis will be important in order to support safe and efficient offshore CCS deployment at large scale.

The prominent closed-loop sCO(2) Brayton cycle has all the potential for the future power generation over the traditional superheated/supercritical Rankine cycle for concentrated solar power applications. Using sCO(2) as a working fluid has been preferred as one of the most efficient and environmentally safe alternatives over the traditional refrigerants and other working fluids. While the thermodynamic analysis of sCO(2) cycles has been in a great number of recent studies, its particular advantages when coupled with dry cooling have not been adequately analyzed. The sCO(2) power cycle efficiency is highly influenced by the cycle lowest temperature, hence cooling system design significantly impacts the cycle performance. In the present work, the applicability and the potential benefits of the dry cooling system are demonstrated for sCO(2) cycles over the traditional Rankine cycle. The detailed thermodynamic modelling of the dry cooling system is presented. Research studies on dry cooled sCO(2) power cycles are reviewed with their major findings. Various techniques are identified from the literature to compensate for the efficiency degradation of the power cycle during high ambient temperature. The implementation of the extremum seeking controller, the hybrid cooling, and the radiative cooling option certainly can improve the cycle performance at the off-design condition. A thermodynamic analysis is performed to design the cooling tower for recompression and the partial cooling cycles. The nodal approach adapted in the present work allows predicting the radical variation of transport properties inside the tubes of the heat exchanger. The towers are designed based on the optimum operating condition of the power cycle. The cycle performance is investigated with the variation sCO(2) entrance temperature into the cooling system and the ambient temperature. This case study shows a pathway in designing the cooling system for sCO(2) power cycles. This review work highly emphasizes the potential benefits of dry cooling in sCO(2) power cycles and presents the cooling system design methodology for efficient cycle operation.	[Ehsan, M.

Planning regional energy system with consideration of energy transition and cleaner production under multiple uncertainties: A case study of Hebei province, China	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Cleaner production; Dual-functional interval; Energy transition; Final energy substitution; Planning	TRANSPORT SECTOR; PROGRAMMING METHOD; DECARBONIZATION; POLLUTION; PATHWAYS; INDUSTRY; TIANJIN	In this study, an interval-fuzzy full-infinite programming (IFFIP) method is developed for planning regional energy system (RES) under multiple uncertainties. IFFIP extends upon the existing full-infinite programming (FIP) by allowing uncertainties expressed as crisp intervals, functional intervals and dual-functional intervals to be effectively incorporated within a general framework. Then, an IFFIP-RES model is formulated for planning RES of Hebei province (China) through considering energy transitions in industrial, transport, and residential sectors. Scenarios related to coal/oil reduction and electricity/nature gas growth in final energy demand are designed to evaluate the impact of final energy substitution on RES. The results reveal that (i) final energy substitution would bring about 7.0% increase in clean energy (including nature gas and renewable energy) and 8.9% reduction in coal over the planning horizon; (ii) electricity demand would increase 38.4% with final energy substitution, and the increased electricity would be converted by coal (57.2%) and renewable resources (26.1%); (iii) pollutants (including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter) from RES would reduce 20.1%; pollutants discharged from industrial, transport and residential sectors would decrease 32.6%, 39.9% and 62.1%, respectively; (iv) nature gas demand would raise rapidly with the energy substitution, and the proportion of imported nature gas would reach up to 97.4%. The results can help the local government explore the relationship among energy transition, electricity generation, as well as environmental emission mitigation under multiple uncertainties, and identify desired policies for RES to achieve cleaner production and sustainable development.

J	Khan, AN; Iqbal, N; Rizwan, A; Ahmad, R; Kim, DH				Khan, Anam-Nawaz; Iqbal, Naeem; Rizwan, Atif; Ahmad, Rashid; Kim, Do-Hyeun			An Ensemble Energy Consumption Forecasting Model Based on Spatial-Temporal Clustering Analysis in Residential Buildings	ENERGIES			English	Article						energy prediction; machine learning; deep learning; ensemble model; stacking; time series; clustering analysis	ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION; PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; LOAD; BLOCKCHAIN; ALGORITHM; MECHANISM; HYBRID	Due to the availability of smart metering infrastructure, high-resolution electric consumption data is readily available to study the dynamics of residential electric consumption at finely resolved spatial and temporal scales. Analyzing the electric consumption data enables the policymakers and building owners to understand consumer's demand-consumption behaviors. Furthermore, analysis and accurate forecasting of electric consumption are substantial for consumer involvement in time-of-use tariffs, critical peak pricing, and consumer-specific demand response initiatives. Alongside its vast economic and sustainability implications, such as energy wastage and decarbonization of the energy sector, accurate consumption forecasting facilitates power system planning and stable grid operations. Energy consumption forecasting is an active research area; despite the abundance of devised models, electric consumption forecasting in residential buildings remains challenging due to high occupant energy use behavior variability. Hence the search for an appropriate model for accurate electric consumption forecasting is ever continuing. To this aim, this paper presents a spatial and temporal ensemble forecasting model for short-term electric consumption forecasting. The proposed work involves exploring electric consumption profiles at the apartment level through cluster analysis based on the k-means algorithm. The ensemble forecasting model consists of two deep learning models; Long Short-Term Memory Unit (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). First, the apartment-level historical electric consumption data is clustered. Later the clusters are aggregated based on consumption profiles of consumers. At the building and floor level, the ensemble models are trained using aggregated electric consumption data. The proposed ensemble model forecasts the electric consumption at three spatial scales apartment, building, and floor level for hourly, daily, and weekly forecasting horizon. Furthermore, the impact of spatial-temporal granularity and cluster analysis on the prediction accuracy is analyzed. The dataset used in this study comprises high-resolution electric consumption data acquired through smart meters recorded on an hourly basis over the period of one year. The consumption data belongs to four multifamily residential buildings situated in an urban area of South Korea. To prove the effectiveness of our proposed forecasting model, we compared our model with widely known machine learning models and deep learning variants. The results achieved by our proposed ensemble scheme verify that model has learned the sequential behavior of electric consumption by producing superior performance with the lowest MAPE of 4.182 and 4.54 at building and floor level prediction, respectively. The experimental findings suggest that the model has efficiently captured the dynamic electric consumption characteristics to exploit ensemble model diversities and achieved lower forecasting error. The proposed ensemble forecasting scheme is well suited for predictive modeling and short-term load forecasting.

Barriers and challenges of the assessment framework of the Commission Recommendation (EU) 2019/786 on building renovation by European RTD projects	ENERGY AND BUILDINGS			English	Article						Building energy renovation; Decarbonising; Energy-efficient buildings; Holistic renovation; European policy; EPBD; Key Performance Indicators	ENERGY EFFICIENCY; RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS; DECISION-MAKING; SUSTAINABILITY; PERFORMANCE; METHODOLOGIES	The refurbishment of buildings is one of the main keys to pursue the targets of the European Green Deal, and to accomplish the European Union has applied two mechanisms among others: the European policy and the European Research and Technological Development (RTD) projects. On the one hand, the EU has published the Commission Recommendation (EU) 2019/786 with an assessment framework composed by Measurable Progress Indicators (MPI) that can be considered the main legal instrument to measure the progress of the decarbonisation together with health & wellness, social and economic related targets of the Directive 2018/844, the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD). On the other hand, the RTD projects also pursue the targets of the EU but following their own assessment methodology com-posed by Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Considering the parallelism of these two mechanisms, the objective of this study is to analyse the applicability of the EU's assessment framework by the RTD pro-jects, establishing a critical point of view of the viability of the MPIs and identifying the barriers and chal-lenges of the evaluation system proposed by the EU. Regarding the methodology, the applicability of MPIs by RTD projects has been analysed in five stages: (1) Identification and listing of the MPIs of EU Recommendation; (2) selection of European RTD projects; (3) identification of the KPIs applied by the projects; (4) study of the concordance of the MPIs of the Commission Recommendation's assessment framework and the KPIs of the RTD projects; (5) evaluation of the barriers and challenges of the applica-bility of the EU's MPIs based on the level of agreement with the projects' KPIs. This investigation shows that although some evaluation scopes of the Commission Recommendation (EU) 2019/786 do agree with high degree with RTD projects, many MPIs present barriers related to the low reliability, the absence of standardised calculation methods, and the lack of data. Besides, the assessment framework of the Commission Recommendation (EU) 2019/786 also presents challenges to improve the evaluation of the building renovation like calibration techniques, standardised input data and the shortlisting of the MPIs to improve the effectiveness of the method. The main conclusion is that the readjustment of the assessment framework proposed in the Recommendation (EU) 2019/786 is needed. This readjustment is proposed to be done by shortlisting the MPIs and defining standardised measurement methods in order to build a common roadmap that could be followed and assessed homogenously towards the decarbon-isation of the European building stock.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

As the urgency to respond to climate change increases and the transport sector disproportionally increases its contributions to global GHG emissions, there is a need for a more meaningful and transparent application of tools to cost GHG emission reduction. This study presents a multi-objective integer optimization (MIO) model to support the costing and GHG reduction estimation of electric mobility road passenger transportation policies. The model considers both cost and GHG emission minimization under resource constraints and background changes in policy interventions within interval ranges for the province of Ontario's (Canada) in year 2030. All Pareto optimal solutions are included but results that indicate the optimal policy allocation for two discrete targets are discussed in detail; one scenario where $3 billion spending over ten years is the target and another scenario where the target is 40% GHG reduction in year 2030 (relative to 2005 levels). The MIO approach offers an out-of-the-box solution to support the GHG-reducing decision-making process at all levels of government by implementing optimal policy combinations to achieve GHG emission reductions under a target GHG emission reduction target and/or budget.

Among them, the major economies in the world, such as the United States (USA), the European Union, Japan, and Canada, have proposed to achieve carbon-neutral targets by 2050. As the world's largest carbon emitter, China has a total carbon emissions of more than 11.3 billion tons, accounting for about 30% of global carbon emissions. Therefore, the carbon emission reduction required for China is much higher than that of other economies, and its carbon-neutral tasks are obviously more complex and diversified. On 22 September 2020, the Chinese government announced in the 75th Session of the UN (United Nations) General Assembly (New York, USA) that China aims to achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. The announcement of the carbon-neutral target clearly indicated that China needs to carry out a self-revolution to achieve zero CO2 emissions before 2060. The concept of carbon neutrality is essentially a balance between carbon sources and carbon sinks. The carbon source is the process of releasing CO2 into the atmosphere, and the carbon sink is the process of absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere. Investigating the atmospheric system within a certain period, when the amount of CO2 emitted by all carbon sources into the system is equal to the amount of CO2 absorbed by all carbon sinks from the system, carbon neutrality can be achieved. There are various carbon sources and sinks in nature with complicated relationships. Among them, the most important carbon source related to human activities is energy production. In 2020, China's power sector emitted about 4 billion tons of CO2 per year, which is close to 40% of the total emissions. Thus, the power sector is one of the key areas in emission reduction to achieve the carbon-neutral goal. Building a carbon-neutral power system is the only way to achieve decarbonization in the energy sector. Based on the carbon balance principle, this paper proposed the critical equation of carbon neutrality for power systems. And the further strategies in establishing a carbon-neutral power system were explored according to the carbon neutrality equation: (1) Improve energy efficiency thus reducing the consumption of carbonaceous energy; (2) adjust the energy structure and reduce the proportion of carbonaceous energy; (3) rebuild the balance of sources and sinks by adopting CO2 capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technology to achieve low-carbon utilization of carbonaceous energy. Results indicate that, although improving energy efficiency of carbonaceous energy is effective in CO2 mitigation, it is limited by the declining energy saving potential of thermal power plants to be the main technical way in carbon emission reduction. Besides, increasing the proportion of renewable energy can quickly reduce the carbon emission intensity of the power system, which is currently the main technical way to reduce the CO2 emission of the power system. However, although energy conservation and the development of renewable energy can reduce the carbon emission intensity of the power system, the CCUS technology and the negative emission technology will be indispensable to achieve the goal of carbon neutrality. And the large-scale promotion of the CCUS technology must overcome technical obstacles of the rather high energy consumption of CO2 capture. Thus, building a carbon-neutral power system in the future requires a combination of energy efficiency, renewable energy and CCUS technology.

Electric vehicles and India's low carbon passenger transport: a long-term co-benefits assessment	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Electric vehicle; CO2 mitigation; Electricity demand; Cobenefits	ION BATTERIES; COSTS; HYBRID	Electric vehicles have attracted the attention of India's policy makers as clean technology alternatives due to their multiple advantages like higher efficiency and lower air pollution in short to medium term and reduced CO2 emissions as electricity gets decarbonized in the long-run under low carbon scenarios. This paper uses an energy system model ANSWER-MARKAL to analyse the role of electric vehicles (EV) in India. The modelling assessment spans the period 2010 to 2050 and analyses future EV demand in India under three scenarios: i) a 'Reference' scenario which includes the continuation of existing EV policies as outlined in India's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC); ii) a 'EV policy' scenario which, in line with India's INDCs, follows targeted supply-side push policies for EVs, but without the budget constraints; and iii) a 'low carbon' scenario which uses an exogenous price for CO2 in line with the global target of 2 degrees C temperature stabilization. The scenarios analysis delineates penetration of EVs and their co-benefits as well as co-costs. The co-benefits relate to local air quality, national energy security and CO2 emissions in India whereas the co-costs (risks) are related to sourcing of raw materials for batteries and battery reprocessing and disposal. The findings show that: i) in the reference scenario, the EVs 2-wheelers will achieve a significant share by 2050. Electric 4-wheelers though would have a small share even in 2050; ii) EV push policies though lead to significant diffusion of electric 2-wheelers in India by 2030. These policies enhance diffusion of electric 4-wheelers only if financial incentives are sustained in the long-term, iii) the application of global carbon price on the Indian economy in the 2 degrees C stabilization scenario increases competitiveness of EVs and results in near total share of electric 2-wheelers by 2030 and a sizable share of electric 4-wheelers by 2050. The high and rising carbon price in low carbon scenario cause deep decarbonisation of electricity and enables EVs to deliver deep cut in CO2 emissions. The results show asymmetry in the impacts of national and global policies on co-benefits from EV. The EV supply push policies deliver moderate benefits vis-a-vis air pollution and energy security indicators but make insignificant contribution CO2 emissions reduction. On the other hand, the global carbon price in the global 2 degrees C stabilization scenario delivers sizable co-benefits vis-a-vis all three indicators. This asymmetry reveal important policy insights: i) the policy sequencing is vital to gain co-benefits, ii) EV technology push policies are good for creating early domestic market for a clean vehicle technology but they may not deliver sizable co-benefits vis--vis CO2 emissions which are global externalities, and iii) implementing strong climate policies early would lead to EVs delivering high co-benefits, in case of India, vis-a-vis all three indicators.

J	Koivunen, T; Syri, S; Veijalainen, N				Koivunen, Tero; Syri, Sanna; Veijalainen, Noora			Contributing factors for electricity storage in a carbon-free power system	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH			English	Article						carbon-free power system; electricity storage; Finland; hydropower; nuclear power; wind power	FUTURE FINNISH ENERGY; IMPACTS; DECARBONIZATION; DEMAND	The Government of Finland is targeting carbon neutrality by 2035. Increasing electrification emphasizes the need for significant emission reductions in power generation. As reduction in power generation emissions is partly realized by increase in intermittent energy sources, electricity storage may become an important part of a carbon neutral power system. This study investigates the behavior of electrical storages as a part of a large-scale national carbon-free power system model. As a case study, a three-year model of a carbon-free Finnish power system set in 2050 with the aim to identify various factors affecting electricity storage, and the results are compared with literature. The proposed case study features various scenarios with a national power system with very high amounts of renewables and a significant hydro capacity, while amount of combustion-based energy production is minimal. In addition, hydrological stress scenarios representing historically severe drought years were introduced. The amount of electricity storage needed was found to be most affected by nuclear and electricity trading capacities, which is consistent with literature findings. The data period used as basis for modeling also affected the need for electricity storage, as interannual variations in renewable production were found to have a large effect on modeled results. The needed electricity storage capacities increased significantly in the stress scenarios. The electricity storage need was found to be seasonal in nature, but this may be partly due to missing demand flexibility within the modeled power system, which caused very large individual storage discharge peaks. The results emphasize the need to take several years of historical data into account to ensure system availability in different conditions. Highlights Nuclear energy was found to decrease system costs in a 100% carbon-free power system. Multi-year modeling is essential to secure system availability due to the important role of hydropower and seasonal wind variability. Electricity storages were found to be seasonal in nature. The main reason was exceptionally low windiness during individual periods, which resulted in large but temporarily short power deficits due to insufficient flexibility obtained from hydropower and power imports. This was especially evident in stress scenarios and mainly contributed to the higher costs in low-nuclear scenarios. Detailed hydropower modelling of historically exceptional dry seasons in Finland was utilized as one stress scenario. Exceptionally, dry long-term period increased the need for electricity storages significantly due to the lost flexibility offered by hydro and reduced electricity import capacities.

Using the information developed in this process, we assess the impact on compliance costs of increasing the flexibility for sources by introducing different emissions trading schemes. For this we develop a detailed optimization model that represents the operational and investment decisions that could be taken by the energy generation, industrial and mining sectors if an Emissions Trading System (ETS) was implemented. An ETS with two cap and trade options is analysed together with an offset mechanism for sources not included in the ETS. Also, two policy goals are considered: a stringent 76% sectoral reduction goal in 2050 similar to Chile's current strict NDC, and a more lax 46% goal similar to Chile's initial 2015 NDC proposal. The results show that (i) cost reductions from increased flexibility for Chile's current strict NDC are significant, and that offsets can play an important role; (ii) the stringency of the reduction goal affects the magnitude of the cost savings related to flexibility and, surprisingly, total abatement costs are negative (i.e. there are benefits) for the 46% reduction goal. In this latter case, the most significant cost reductions result from compelling firms to comply with their allowances in each sector, not increased flexibility. These results highlight the policy relevance of case by case analysis using a modelling approach similar to the one we develop here. Key policy insights ETS implementation can help Chile meet its mitigation commitment for 2050. The compliance costs can vary significantly depending on the flexibility implemented in the emissions trading schemes. Optimization models can help decision-makers define the attributes of an ETS, such as the sectors that should participate, the cap, and the percentage of offsets. The proposed methodology also highlights and quantifies the offsets that can be acquired from sectors that are not part of an ETS, such as forestry, agriculture, and the waste sector. The possibility to acquire of offsets could reduce significantly the cost for industries that participate of an ETS.

Digital technologies can potentially drive such a sustainable transformation, but two main objectives of environmental sustainability must be considered for achieving this target: decarbonisation and dematerialisation. We empirically investigate the potentials for these two objectives by employing a survey-based approach, investigating companies' developments in China, Brazil, and Germany, in a va-riety of industrial sectors, and in companies of different sizes. These cases provide insight on a multi -country perspective into developments in digitalisation in countries with different pre-conditions for dig-ital transformation, which is a novelty to this research field. We show that even though most industrial practitioners expect an improvement of the environmental sustainability of their respective company due to the application of Industry 4.0 technologies, factual improvements in resource efficiency and energy consumption are not expected to develop in a similarly optimistic fashion. These findings challenge the assumed effects of Industry 4.0 discussed in the vast majority of prior literature which expresses high hopes for positive impacts on resource efficiency and energy consumption . This can be interpreted as an indication that Industry 4.0 will not automatically lead to environmental improvements instead this transformation towards a more sustainable economy needs to be accompanied by supporting measures. On the positive side we find that the higher the current Industry 4.0 level of companies, the greater their ability to match their supply with the actual demand and their likelihood for participating in Demand Response schemes. This is an important prerequisite for the stabilisation and efficient use of future re-newable energy systems. Our study provides insights to policy makers and practitioners but also fellow researchers regarding current trends in the implementation of Industry 4.0 and in how far they support the transformation towards more sustainability. We conclude that the implementation of the Industry 4.0 concept should always be critically evaluated against the background of the SDGs and must be supple-mented by a combination of regulation and incentives through governing bodies, which includes setting binding targets for saving energy and material and reducing non-recyclable waste.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

Specifically, the analysis elaborates the importance of knowledge development, actor networks, and institutions (including policy) for progressing and diffusing novel technologies related to energy use. The empirical analysis also sheds light on how significant changes in the sectoral innovation system have influenced the relevant research, development and demonstration activities in the Swedish pulp and paper industry over the period 1970-2010. The results are based on various sources-e.g., industry magazines, reports from industrial consultants and associations, minutes from meetings-and illustrate the importance of well-functioning innovation systems for successful technological development and diffusion processes. They display, in particular, the importance of joint, industry-wide R&D activities, trust-based state-industry relationships, government R&D expenditures, and intense information sharing. One important implication is that the role of policy stretches beyond the funding of basic R&D. Policy also involves measures that strengthen existing actor networks, build competence, and secure the existence of research institutes that provide a bridge between basic knowledge generation (at the universities) on the one hand, and industrial application on the other.

J	Liu, Y; Yao, T; Bai, YL; Liu, Y				Liu, Ying; Yao, Tang; Bai, Yunli; Liu, Yu			The sustainability of drinking water supply in rural China: Does the provision of drinking water investment mismatch the demand of residents?	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH			English	Article						Drinking water investment; Household demand; Rural sustainability	MANAGEMENT; DEMOCRACY; PROGRAM; HEALTH	It is doubted that the top down nature of investment planning may lead to mismatches between drinking water investment and the demands of local residents in rural China. Statistical and econometric analysis based on data of 2020 rural households from five Chinese provinces from 1998 to 2011 are used to illustrate the linkage between demand for drinking water investment and construction of drinking water projects. Household's demand significantly affects drinking water projects implemented by upper level governments and implemented jointly, but is not significant in explaining the projects implemented by village. There is evidence to suggest that the demands of local leaders override those of households in the implementation of drinking water projects provided by village in the early stage of 2005-2008. The situation improves in the latter stage of 2008-2011 when the village level participatory bodies begin to provide opportunities for households to voice their preferences on public goods investment. The results of this study imply that it is important to explore appropriate regulations and policies that enabling local cadres to better meet local demands of their communities to ensure the sustainability of rural drinking water supply.

Two case studies for chemical production were conducted to discuss the possible designs of electrified heat supply for processing industries and to compare the characteristics of heat recovery networks and utility systems under electrification with those under conventional fossil-fuel energy systems. The application of the heatintegrated design method is effective in providing design strategies for the transformation to electrified energy systems, as well as in evaluating plant-wide implications of electrification in practice. The design interaction between heat recovery and electrification was also investigated, and the cost-effectiveness of electrified energy systems was found to be highly influenced by heat recovery. The current study demonstrated that industrial electrification can be a practical alternative for industrial energy supply and that electrified heating can be economical with a low-cost and renewable source of electricity.

While Australia has one of the best solar resources in the world, it also has an abundance of conventional fuels such as coal and natural gas. The country is heavily dependent on fossil fuels for its primary energy supply and international trade, and is seeking pathways to reduce emissions intensity. While renewable electricity will be able to displace fossil fuels in the electricity sector, this only addresses about 16% of energy consumption by end use. Concentrating solar fuels (CSF) are produced either in full or in part from concentrated solar energy, and can provide either complete or partial reduction of the CO2 emissions associated with energy consumption. Our study reviewed the various potential solar thermal technology pathways and feedstocks available to produce a range of CSF products such as hydrogen, ammonia, methanol and synthetic gasoline or diesel. We conducted what we believe to be the broadest and most sophisticated evaluation of the many options to identify those that are most prospective, including an evaluation of the expected final fuel costs. The study identified the following opportunities for CSF: Australia: substitution of imported liquid fuels (gasoline and diesel) with synthetic CSF options would provide fuel security through the utilization of domestic resources. Ammonia is also a potentially attractive CSF product as it is produced in large quantities for fertilisers and explosives. Export markets: Australia has significant trading relationships with many Asian countries in the energy domain, and CSF fuels could provide a long term future to enable such relationships to continue - or grow - in a carbon constrained world. Japan in particular is considering how to transition to a hydrogen economy, and could be a customer for CSF hydrogen or possibly ammonia as a hydrogen carrier or future fuel The project recommended that Australia continue to develop a range of CSF technologies to provide a pathway to progressive decarbonisation. In the short to medium term, solar fossil hybrids can produce conventional fuels at costs comparable to crude oil derived counterparts (at similar to$100 barrel). In the longer term, redox cycles have the potential to provide CO2 neutral fuels from solar energy alone.

Multiscale simulation of integrated energy system and electricity market interactions	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Integrated energy systems; Electricity markets; Unit commitment; Operations; Design; Optimal control	OPERATION; DISPATCH; STRATEGY; DESIGN	Accelerating the deep decarbonization of the world's electric grids requires the coordination of complex energy systems and infrastructures across timescales from seconds to decades. In this paper, we present a new multiscale simulation framework that integrates process-and grid-centric modeling paradigms to better design, operate, and control integrated energy systems (IESs), which combine multiple technologies, in wholesale energy markets. Traditionally, IESs are analyzed with a process-centric paradigm such as levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) or annualized net revenue, ignoring important interactions with electricity markets. This framework explicitly models the complex interactions between an IES's bidding, scheduling, and control decisions and the energy market's clearing and settlement processes, while incorporating operational uncertainties. Through two case studies, we show the importance of understanding and quantifying complex resource-grid interactions. In case study 1, we demonstrate that optimized bidding from one resource shifts the profit distribution for all energy systems in the market. This result suggests new and more flexible IES technologies can disrupt the economics of all market participants, possibly leading to accelerated retirements of less flexible resources. Interestingly, the optimized bidding has little impact on grid-level aggregate statistics, such as total generation costs and renewable penetration rate. While aggregate modeling strategies may remain valid under some IES adoption scenarios for analysis focused on regional outcomes, direct comparisons of IES technologies at specific locations without considering these interactions may lead to misleading or incorrect conclusions. In case study 2, we consider the design and flexible operation of IESs that hybridize conventional generators with energy storage. Through a sensitivity analysis, we find that as the size of the storage system increases, the total number of start-ups for coal-and natural gas-based IESs reduced by 25% and 33.6%, and the total thermal generator ramping (i.e., mileage) reduced by 86.5% and 62.5%, respectively. This shows the primary benefit of storage may not be reduced operational costs (which do not change significantly) but fewer start-ups and less ramping, which may greatly simplify the design, operation, and control of carbon capture systems. The new modeling and optimization capabilities from this work enable the coupling of rigorous, dynamic process models with grid-level production cost models to quantitatively identify the nuanced interdependencies across these vast timescales that must be addressed to realize clean, safe, and secure energy production. Moreover, the proposed general multiscale simulation framework is applicable to all IES technologies and can be easily extended to consider other energy carriers (e.g., hydrogen, ammonia) and energy infrastructures (e.g., natural gas pipelines).

Improving durability of silicone-based paint coatings used in solar power plants by controlling consolidation procedures	SOLAR ENERGY			English	Article						CSP; Pyromark; Micro wear; Scratch; Durability	ABSORBER COATINGS; SYSTEM; DECARBONIZATION; PENETRATION; RECEIVERS; EVOLUTION	Pyromark is a silicone-based black paint that is commonly used in concentrated solar power plants because of its relatively high absorptivity. However, it has very low durability, which decreases the optical performance of the surfaces coated with this paint over time, thus reducing the thermal efficiencies of these plants. Recent studies have tried to develop promising materials to circumvent this problem; however, there is no commercial substitute for Pyromark as yet. Therefore, improving the durability of this paint is necessary to enhance the power plants operation. In this work, we study the durability of Pyromark through the micro-wear performance of the coatings assessed by scratch tests. Curing and vitrification procedures control the physical and mechanical properties of the manufactured coatings. For the first time, we demonstrate that the time-dependent behavior and related properties such as the material relaxation times are key parameters controlling the durability of this type of paint. The ability of the material to store elastic energy also explains why some consolidation procedures are better to increase its durability.	[Martinez, N.; Rico, A.; Munez, C.

Hydrogen and other simple chemical products have been efficiently manufactured using renewable light energy or secondary energy sources, such as electricity. More impor-tantly, the direct use of water as a ubiquitous and clean hydrogen (or electron) and oxygen source in organic synthesis has recently been realized. Semiconductor photo-and electrocatalysts, such as metal oxides, play significant roles in energy transformations and in the activation of reactant chemicals. This paper reviews recent developments in organic synthesis using water and renewable light or electric energy to achieve sustainable chemical production. TiO2 is especially featured as a reaction platform where both reactants and water are efficiently activated through coordination with the TiO2 surface.

To what extent does the choice of the methodology condition the narrative produced by the analysis? The present work argues that the two questions are tightly coupled. The technique is never neutral. If we are the tools of our tools, as suggested by Thoreau, then it can also be said that language is not only a vehicle for communication, it is the driver as well. For this reason, in sustainability assessment it is not unusual to discern a close relationship between arguments made and methods adopted. In the present work a set of six reflexive analytical tools we call them lenses is suggested which could be pooled to the effect to appraise and improve the quality of integrated assessment and the resulting sustainability narratives, and to alleviate the constraints of the method-argument dependency. None of the lenses is new and each has been used before. Never have they been used together. The lenses are (i) Post-normal science (PNS), (ii) Controversy studies, (iii) Sensitivity auditing, (iv) Bioeconomics, (v) Ethics of science for governance, and (vi) Non-Ricardian economics. The six lenses are illustrated together with a set of case/narratives/arguments. The lenses allow some narratives or methodologies to be shown as either implausible or inadequate, and new narratives to be developed to tackle pressing sustainability issues, which expand the horizon of possible strategies for a solution.

J	Hale, T				Hale, Thomas			Catalytic Cooperation	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; PARIS AGREEMENT; LONG-TERM; GOVERNANCE; LEADERS; DECARBONIZATION; NEGOTIATIONS; INNOVATION; POLITICS; MODELS	Scholars typically model the politics of global public goods or common pool resources as difficult collective action problems. Theories of international organization aim to explain how institutions can promote cooperation by solving the free rider problem. Based on an analysis of a quintessential global collective action problem-international climate mitigation-this article challenges both this diagnosis of the problem and the concomitant institutional remedies. Important elements of climate mitigation exhibit three key features that depart from the canonical model: joint goods, preference heterogeneity, and increasing returns. The presence of these features creates the possibility for "catalytic cooperation." Under such conditions, the chief barrier to cooperation is not the threat of free riding but the lack of incentive to act in the first place. States and other actors seek to solve this problem by creating "catalytic institutions" that work to shift actors' preferences and strategies toward cooperative outcomes over time. While catalytic institutions can be seen in many areas of world politics, the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change has put this logic of cooperation at its core, raising the possibility that similar catalytic institutions may facilitate cooperation in other areas of world politics characterized by analogous problem structures.

The assumption that permissible levels of greenhouse gas emissions cannot exceed the global average temperature increase of 2 degrees C in relation to pre-industrial levels remains uncertain. Despite this uncertainty, the direct implication is that enormous quantities of fossil fuels have, thus far, wrongly been counted as assets by hydrocarbon firms as they cannot be exploited if we want to keep climate under certain control. These are the so-called toxic assets. Due to the relationship among CO2 emissions, GDP, energy consumption, and energy efficiency, the concept of toxic assets can be transferred to toxic income, which is the income level that would generate levels of CO2 emissions incompatible with keeping climate change under control. This research, using a simulation model based on country-based econometric models, estimated a threshold for income per capita above which the temperature limit of 2 degrees C would be surpassed. Under the business as usual scenario, average per capita income would be $14,208 (in constant 2010 USD) in 2033; and under the intervention scenario, which reflects the commitments of the COP21 meeting held in Paris in December 2015, the toxic revenue would be $13,433 (in constant 2010 USD) in 2036.

We develop a method to simulate nuclear schedule optimization to reflect how plant managers maximize plant availability during peak-demand periods. Using this schedule optimization, we compute each plant's minimum power level and its variation over time to evaluate the flexibility potential. Three nuclear flexibility hypotheses are considered: one where fleet schedule is considered constant, which is standard practice in the energy systems modeling literature, one with an optimized fleet schedule with constant minimum power, and one with an optimized fleet schedule with physics-induced minimum power variations. Sensitivity analysis highlights the links between the fleet's schedule optimization, minimal power variations, relative share of nuclear and re-newables in the capacity mix, and results of simulation models. We find that the nuclear fleet's optimization and associated realistic minimum power variations gain in importance with increasing relative share of nuclear in the capacity mix. The schedule's importance holds as renewables' installed capacities heighten as the residual de-mand level decreases. This paper highlights the potential benefits of modeling nuclear schedule optimizations and the resulting minimum power evolutions. Both aspects are crucial for evaluating nuclear flexibility char-acteristics in simplified low-carbon electric systems that use a significant share of renewable energy.

The exploitation and utilization of energy by human beings has continued through human evolution without interruption. Fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and natural gas, have promoted tremendous social change and brought inestimable value to human beings. Traditional fossil fuels are non-renewable energy sources with limited reserves in the earth's crust. Excessive exploitation without replacement or alternative energy sources will inevitably lead to fossil fuel depletion. Due to increasing environmental pollution, humans begin to realize environmental hazards caused by the excessive use of fossil fuels, such as global warming, acid rain, and particulate matters. With respect to severe energy and environmental crises, it is imperative to develop green and clean energy technologies to reduce the use of increasingly exhausted fossil fuels and achieve environmentally-friendly and sustainable social developments. Hydrogen, as a renewable energy carrier, has attracted significant attention due to the following four reasons. First, hydrogen is a clean and low-carbon energy carrier and its reaction product is only water with no carbon dioxide emissions. Second, hydrogen has a high calorific value, about three times higher than fossil fuels. Third, hydrogen is widely used in electricity, construction, transportation, and industrial fields. It can be used as a raw material for the steel, metallurgical and chemical industries and as a fuel in fuel cells. Fourth, hydrogen is earth-abundant, which can originate from fossil fuel reforming, water splitting, and by-products of the chlor-alkali industry. Many governments around the world are committed to developing hydrogen energy and arranging relevant industrial chains. The International Renewable Energy Agency pointed out that hydrogen can build a connection among electricity, construction, industry, and transportation to achieve deep decarbonization. Developing various technologies for hydrogen production is important in developing hydrogen energy and the hydrogen economy. Nowadays, there are three main pathways for hydrogen production, namely, methane-steam reforming, coal gasification, and electrocatalytic water splitting. Though the first two pathways account for about 95% of hydrogen production, they still rely on fossil fuels and emit large amounts of carbon dioxide, which violates the goal of developing hydrogen energy. In contrast, electrocatalytic water splitting does not lead to carbon emissions and is a green and sustainable hydrogen production technology. However, electrocatalytic water splitting has shortcomings of excessive energy consumption and high cost, which restricts its large-scale application. Electrocatalytic water splitting contains a cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and an anodic oxygen evolution reaction ( OER), both which need efficient electrocatalysts to overcome the high reaction barrier. Therefore, how to improve electrocatalytic performance and reduce electrolytic overpotential are keys in realizing large-scale applications of electrocatalytic water splitting. Over the past few years, various methods have been developed to prepare electrocatalysts for electrocatalytic water splitting, mainly including the hydrothermal/solvothermal method, sol-gel method, electrochemical deposition, chemical bath deposition, chemical vapor deposition, and physical vapor deposition. Specifically, lasers have become an effective tool to prepare catalysts for electrocatalytic water splitting with advantages of being efficient, flexible, contactless, and highly controllable. Many corresponding advances have been achieved, but they still face a series of challenges in terms of industrial feasibility and performance improvement. Hence, it is important and necessary to summarize the existing research to guide the future development of this field more rationally. Progress Preparation methods of electrocatalysts for electrocatalytic water splitting based on lasers and their catalytic performances have been summarized. First, the implementation process of electrocatalytic water splitting, evaluation parameters, classification, and preparation methods of electrocatalysts are introduced. The evaluation parameters include overpotential, Tafel slope, stability, Faraday efficiency, and turnover frequency. Then, the catalytic performances of electrocatalysts prepared by laser are comprehensively summarized according to previously reported studies. Subsequently, powder catalysts by laser in liquid and self-supported catalytic electrodes with micronano structures by laser are elaborated. Considering the interaction mechanism, the preparation process of powder catalysts by laser can be divided into laser irradiation in liquid and laser ablation in liquid. Haimei Zheng's research group from University of California, Berkeley, has pioneered laser irradiation in liquid. Xiwen Du's research group from Tianjin University has engaged in plenty of systematic studies on laser ablation in liquid. Based on the preparation method, the preparation process of self-supported catalytic electrodes with micro-nano structures by laser can be divided into laser direct preparation and laser hybrid with other chemical synthesis methods. Currently, studies of self-supported catalytic electrodes by laser are limited and incomprehensive. In the end, the problems faced and ongoing research trends in this field are discussed, including the type of laser, the characterization and theoretical calculation of catalysts, the design of bifunctional catalysts, and the performance evaluations at industrial conditions. Conclusion and Prospect Lasers are gradually becoming a popular tool to prepare various functional materials. In summary, the preparation of micro -nano catalysts for electrocatalytic water splitting by laser still needs in-depth and detailed exploration to promote the development of this hydrogen production technology in academic and engineering aspects.

We evaluate the effect on curtailment from various flexibility approaches, including storage, thermal generator flexibility, operating reserve eligibility rules, transmission constraints, and temporal resolution, by using a highly resolved realistic system. Results reveal two aspects of a curtailment paradox as the system evolves to higher solar penetration levels. First, thermal generator parameters, especially in restricting minimum operating levels and ramp rates, affect VRE curtailment more in mid-PV penetration levels (similar to 25%-40%) but much less at lower (similar to 20%) or higher (similar to 45%) PV penetration levels. Second, although allowing VRE and storage to provide operating reserve results in significant operating costs and curtailment benefits, the price suppression effect from these resources reduces incentives for PV to provide operating reserves with curtailed energy.

Significant resources have been directed toward developing cost-effective energy storage, with research and development efforts dominated by work on lithium ion (Li-ion) battery technology. Though Li-ion batteries have many attractive qualities, it is not clear whether they can provide an affordable levelized cost of storage (LCOS) for certain applications, such as buildings. Buildings consume most of the world's electricity, and as much as 50% of their consumption goes toward meeting thermal loads. Thermal energy storage (TES) can provide a cost-effective alternative to Li-ion batteries for buildings; however, two questions remain to be answered. First, how much of total building energy storage requirements can be met via thermal storage for building loads? Second, can the LCOS for TES be favorable compared with Li-ion batteries? In this perspective, using the United States as a case study, we show that the total requirement for TES in buildings is in the range of similar to 1200-4500 electrical GW h, depending on the fraction of solar versus wind in the generation mix. Furthermore, we show that with at least 25% wind generation, all of the storage needed by buildings to support the grid can be met by TES. We also introduce a framework to calculate LCOS for on-site TES in buildings to enable a direct comparison with electrical storage technologies such as Li-ion batteries. This is not trivial, because the input energy type for TES (electricity) differs from the output energy type (thermal energy), and the efficiency can depend on ambient conditions. Our LCOS analysis shows that in many situations, TES can be more cost-effective for buildings than Li-ion batteries. We conclude our perspective by discussing future research and development opportunities that can significantly advance the deployment of TES for buildings to help enable a renewable electricity-dependent grid.

Summer-dominant solar electricity generation can often be balanced by winter-dominant wind electricity generation. Together with long-duration storage, balanced solar and wind generation are well positioned to provide reliable renewable electricity. However, in some locations the wind may not complement solar energy so well. For example, currently California's wind turbines produce more electricity during summer than winter, raising the question of whether all future wind plants in California will exhibit the same seasonality. As a response to this question, in this paper, we analyzed the generation from existing California wind plants and simulated potential onshore wind resource for the whole state using a metric that reflects the relative wind resource in winter. Our results indicate that the seasonality of the wind can vary for very small spatial difference with more than half of California showing stronger wind resource in the winter compared with the summer despite the current observation of the opposite trend. This study differentiates the seasonality of potential wind resources to inform the creation of a reliable, 100%-renewable-driven grid.& nbsp; (C) 2022 Author(s).

To effectively design policies for urban sustainability, it is important to understand the trends of flows in energy and materials as they enter and leave a city. This knowledge is essential for determining the key elements characterizing future urban growth and addressing future supply challenges. Methods This paper presents an analysis of the energy and material flows in the city of Bogota over the time span from 2001 to 2017. Urban flows are also characterized in terms of their temporal evolution with respect to population growth to compare and identify the changes in the main input flows, wealth production, emissions and waste in the city. Results The results of the analysis are then compared with those for other selected large urban agglomerations in Latin America and worldwide to highlight similarities and make inferences. The results show that in Bogota, there was a decrease in some of the material flows, such as the consumption of water and the generation of discharge, in recent years, while there was an increase in the consumption of energy and cement and in the production of CO2 emissions and construction materials. Solid waste production remained relatively stable. With respect to the other large cities considered, we observe that the 10-year growth rates of the flows with respect to population growth are lower in Bogota, particularly when compared with the other urban agglomerations in Latin America. Conclusions The findings of this study are important for advancing characterizations of the trends of material and energy flows in cities, and they contribute to the establishment of a benchmark that allows for the definition and evaluation of the different impacts of public policy while promoting the sustainability of Bogota in the coming decades.

Hydrogen yields of up to 14.4 Ndm(3) H-2.(h.g(cat))(-1) were obtained using the Ni-based catalysts, and methane conversions above 80% were observed with the Fe-based catalysts. In addition to hydrogen production, the Ni-based catalysts allowed the large-scale production of fishbone-like carbon nanofibres, whereas the use of the Fe-based catalysts promoted the production of carbonaceous filaments having a high degree of structural order, consisting of both chain-like carbon nanofibres and carbon nanotubes.

To help gauge these challenges to the power system, we quantify IAV of wind and solar resource and electricity generation across the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) power system, then assess the IAV of wind and solar electricity generation during peak-load hours (i.e. IAV of wind and solar capacity values) for the current ERCOT wind and solar generator fleet. To do so, we leverage the long timespan of four reanalysis datasets with the high resolution of grid integration datasets. We find the IAV (quantified as the coefficient of variation) of wind generation ranges from 2.3%-11% across ERCOT, while the IAV of solar generation ranges from 1.7%-5% across ERCOT. We also find significant seasonal and regional variability in the IAV of wind and solar generation, highlighting the importance of considering multiple temporal and spatial scales when planning and operating the power system. In addition, the IAV of the current wind and solar fleets' capacity values (defined as generation during peak-load hours) are larger than the IAV of the same fleets' capacity factors. IAV of annual generation and capacity values of wind and solar could impact operations and planning in several ways, e.g. through annual emissions, meeting emission reduction targets, and investment needs to maintain capacity adequacy.

The current global climate policy agenda requires technological change, innovation, labour markets and the financial system to be led towards an orderly and rapid low-carbon transition. Yet progress has been slow and incremental. Inadequacies of policy appraisal frameworks used worldwide may be significant contributors to the problem, as they frequently fail to adequately account for the dynamics of societal and technological change. Risks are underestimated, and the economic opportunities from innovation are generally not assessed in practice. Here, we identify root causes of those inadequacies and identify them to structural features of standard analysis frameworks. We use a review of theoretical principles of complexity science and the science of dynamical systems and formulate a generalisation of existing frameworks for policy analysis and the appraisal of outcomes of proposed policy strategies, to help better identify and frame situations of transformational change. We use the term "risk-opportunity analysis" to capture the generalised approach, in which conventional economic cost-benefit analysis is a special case. New guiding principles for policy-making during dynamic and transformational change are offered.	[Mercure, Jean-Francois; Nijsse, Femke J. M.

Carbon produced by ethane and propane was predominantly deposited as long filaments formed by spherical aggregates with diameters on the order of nanometres. Furthermore, the influence of ethane and propane on methane decomposition over BP2000 was also investigated, showing enrichment in hydrogen concentration with the addition of small amounts of these hydrocarbons in the feed. Additionally, the positive catalytic effect of H2S on methane decomposition over BP2000 is addressed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Pinilla, J. L.; Suelves, I.; Lazaro, M.

Metallic and carbonaceous -based catalysts performance in the solar catalytic decomposition of methane for hydrogen and carbon production	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY			English	Article						Catalytic decomposition of methane; Hydrogen production; Solar reactor; Carbon nanotubes; Carbon nanofibers; Amorphous carbon	THERMAL-DECOMPOSITION; FILAMENTOUS CARBON; NI; DISSOCIATION; NANOFIBERS; REACTOR; DECARBONIZATION; CRACKING; BLACKS; SIZE	Solar catalytic decomposition of methane (SCDM) was investigated in a solar furnace facility with different catalysts. The aim of this exploratory study was to investigate the potential of the catalytic methane decomposition approach providing the reaction heat via solar energy at different experimental conditions. All experiments conducted pointed out to the simultaneous production of a gas phase composed only by hydrogen and un-reacted methane with a solid product deposited into the catalyst particles varying upon the catalysts used: nanostructured carbons either in form of carbon nanofibers (CNF) or multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) were obtained with the metallic catalyst whereas amorphous carbon was produced using a carbonaceous catalyst. The use of catalysts in the solar assisted methane decomposition present some advantages as compared to the high temperature non-catalytic solar methane decomposition route, mainly derived from the use of lower temperatures (600-950 degrees C): SCDM yields higher reaction rates, provides an enhancement in process efficiency, avoids the formation of other hydrocarbons (100% selectivity to H-2) and increases the quality of the carbonaceous product obtained, when compared to the non-catalytic route.

J	Rodriguez, M				Rodriguez, Miguel			Why do many prospective analyses of CO2 emissions fail? An illustrative example from China	ENERGY			English	Article						Carbon emissions; Prospective studies; Intensity targets; Energy; Productivity; China	INDEX DECOMPOSITION ANALYSIS; RELATIVE IMPORTANCE; INTENSITY CHANGES; AGGREGATE ENERGY; CARBON INTENSITY; DECARBONIZATION; GUIDE	The main contribution of this paper is a demonstration of the importance of taking into account the evolution of the generation of value added and productivity to avoid biased prospective analysis of Chinese energy-related CO2 emissions. To that end, the paper delivers a Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index decomposition analysis of carbon emissions intensity from 1995 to 2014 for a balanced panel of disaggregated Chinese economic sectors. The paper shows that similar assumptions deliver different out-comes when prospective analyses are based on energy intensity, or alternatively its factorial decomposition, in order to take into account changes in the generation of value added (e.g., productivity). Following this hypothesis, the paper suggests that China will be unable to accomplish its pledged commitments under the Paris Agreement on climate change, despite strong reductions in energy intensity. Analyses based on the usual (standard) approach, by using intensity measures instead of its factorial decomposition, reach the opposite conclusion. The main lesson from this paper is that alter -native designs of prospective analysis (using alternative drivers or variables) leads to different lines of reasoning and conclusions. Therefore, researchers, consultants and policy makers will underestimate CO2 emissions if they continue to base their prospective analysis on intensity indicators. (C) 2022 The Author.

Comparison of metal and carbon catalysts for hydrogen production by methane decomposition	APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL			English	Article						COx-free H-2 production; CH4 decomposition; Ni-catalysts; Fe-catalysts; Hydrotalcites; Activated carbon; Carbon black; Carbon nanotubes	FLUIDIZED-BED; THERMOCATALYTIC DECOMPOSITION; THERMAL-DECOMPOSITION; NATURAL-GAS; PYROLYSIS; NI; DECARBONIZATION; REGENERATION; TEMPERATURE; NICKEL	The COx-free hydrogen production by decomposition of methane was carried out over metal-free carbons and bulk and supported metal catalysts. Catalysts based on Ni or Fe (oxides, spinels and ex-hydrotalcite mixed oxides) and carbon-catalysts of different types (carbon black, activated carbon, carbon nanotubes and graphite) have been used and the performance of both different kinds of catalyst compared in the target reaction, focussing the comparative study on the initial activity and the resistance against deactivation. Catalytic results showed that activity of carbon catalysts is similar to that of the non-prereduced metal catalysts. Carbon blacks, and specifically vulcan-type, were found to be most resistant catalysts against deactivation, while the most active ones were nickel catalysts derived from hydrotalcite-like precursors (ex-LDH). It was also shown that pre-reduction treatment of nickel precursor to generate the metallic Ni-0 phase before the reaction decreases the threshold temperature to generate hydrogen by about 200 degrees C. Along the course of the reaction, nanotubes and nanofibers are formed on the surface of metal catalysts. These carbon structures encapsulate metal particles and deactivate the catalysts. However, when carbons are used as catalysts, the nature of carbon deposits depends largely on the type of carbon material employed as catalyst in the methane decomposition. Thus, the use of carbon blacks and graphite yielded amorphous turbostratic carbon, whereas activated carbons mainly produced carbon, which showed the carbon black structure. Finally, the carbon by-product of the reaction, when carbon nanotubes were used bas catalysts, accumulates in the form of extra layers over the walls of carbon nanotubes thus increasing their wall thickness.

Development of Ni-Al Catalysts for Hydrogen and Carbon Nanofibre Production by Catalytic Decomposition of Methane. Effect of MgO Addition	TOPICS IN CATALYSIS			English	Article						Hydrogen production; Carbon nanofibres; Methane decomposition; Spinel-like Ni catalysts; Catalyst deactivation and regeneration	FILAMENTOUS CARBON; NICKEL-CATALYSTS; SUPPORTED NICKEL; NANOTUBE GROWTH; DIRECT CRACKING; NI/SIO2; DECARBONIZATION; MECHANISMS; NUCLEATION; KINETICS	Catalytic decomposition of methane is a potential alternative route for the production of hydrogen and nanocarbonaceous materials from natural gas and other hydrocarbon feedstocks. In the present paper, we report the results of characterization and catalytic behaviour during the methane decomposition reaction of a spinel-like Ni-Mg-Al catalyst prepared by coprecipitation. The influence of reaction temperature and feed composition on carbon content, carbon formation rate and carbon morphology has also been studied. The main consequence of MgO addition to the support is the increase in the activity and stability of the Ni-Al catalysts. The better performance of Ni-Mg-Al catalysts is due to the higher interaction generated between Ni particles and the support in this catalyst, which prevents the formation of large metallic particles. The carbonaceous products are carbon nanofibres (diameters 10-35 nm) and amorphous carbon, which causes the catalyst deactivation by encapsulation. The amount of each type of carbonaceous material depends on the different operating conditions used. The reduction-reaction-regeneration cycles lead to a remarkable sintering of the Ni crystallites due to weakening of the metal-support interaction.	[Latorre, N.; Villacampa, J.

Due to China's large size and imbalanced development, the achievement of such targets depends on the performances of China's provinces. Under such a circumstance, this study aims to identify the driving forces and predict the trajectories of China's overall and provincial energy-related CO2 emissions. The generalized Divisia index decomposition analysis results show that investment sale expansion is the major driver of CO2 emission growth in China and most Chinese provinces, which is partly offset by the efficiency gains. Our dynamic scenario simulation results show that most Chinese provinces will achieve their CO2 intensity reduction targets but have difficulties in achieving their CO2 emission peak targets. Further integration of both efficiency and technology improvement is one effective approach toward peaking CO2 emissions. Provincial disparities exist, resulting in that different factors have different impacts in different Chinese provinces. Consequently, it is crucial to set up appropriate province-specific emission peak targets and raise province-specific emission reduction policies by considering the local realities.

This paper analyzes the competitiveness and role of battery storage, six types of pumped-hydro storage, open cycle gas turbine (OCGT), and demand response (DR) technologies in providing the firm capacity required to guarantee the security of supply in a real-size power system such as the Spanish one in horizon 2030. The paper contributes with detailed and realistic modeling of the DR capabilities. Demand is disaggregated by sector and activities and projected towards 2030, applying a growth rate by activity. The load flexibility constraints are considered to ensure the validity of the results. A generation operation planning and expansion model, SPLODER, is conveniently upgraded to properly represent the different storage alternatives addressed in the paper. The results highlight the importance of considering demand response for evaluating long-term firm capacity requirements, showing a non-negligible impact on the investment decisions on the amount of firm capacity required in the system and the optimal shares of wind and solar PV renewable generation. Results also show the dominance of cost-competitiveness of pumped hydro and OCGTs over batteries. Additionally, capacity payments are required to support firm capacity providers' investments.

The variability of RES output ranges from one hour to a season, and critical events such as low supply and high demand might occur more frequently and for more extended periods. When evaluating the role of Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) in this context, the need for a long time scope to capture the different RES variabilities must be reconciled with the need for modeling the hourly chronology. This paper presents a medium-term operation planning model, addressing both the energy dispatch and the balancing services. This study shows that representing the combined chronological variability of demand and RES production is essential to properly assess the roles of different kinds of ESSs in the future 2030 electricity mix. Otherwise, it would not be possible to appropriately capture the frequency, depth, and length of events for which ESSs are activated. The analysis also highlights the importance of considering balancing services, given the significant contribution of batteries to the reserve market. Finally, the results show that batteries and Pumped Storage Hydro (PSH) have different roles in the Spanish electricity system with a high renewable penetration. While PSH is mainly used to provide energy during critical periods, batteries mostly provide balancing services. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, digitalization has historically increased environmental impacts at local and planetary scales, affecting labor markets, resource use, governance, and power relationships. Here we study the past, present, and future of digitalization through the lens of three interdependent elements of the Anthropocene: (a) planetary boundaries and stability, (b) equity within and between countries, and (c) human agency and governance, mediated via (i) increasing resource efficiency, (ii) accelerating consumption and scale effects, (iii) expanding political and economic control, and (iv) deteriorating social cohesion. While direct environmental impacts matter, the indirect and systemic effects of digitalization are more profoundly reshaping the relationship between humans, technosphere and planet. We develop three scenarios: planetary instability, green but inhumane, and deliberate for the good. We conclude with identifying leverage points that shift human-digital-Earth interactions toward sustainability.

The four disciplines emphasize cultural, economic, geographic, historical, political, and social-structural factors to be important drivers of and responses to climate change. Each of these disciplines has unique perspectives and makes noteworthy contributions to our shared understanding of anthropogenic drivers, but they also complement one another and contribute to integrated, multidisciplinary frameworks. The article begins with discussions of research on temporal dimensions of human drivers of carbon emissions, highlighting interactions between long-term and near-term drivers. Next, descriptions of the disciplines' contributions to the understanding of mitigation and adaptation are provided. It concludes with a summary of key lessons offered by the four disciplines as well as suggestions for future research.
